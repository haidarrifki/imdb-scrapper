review,sentiment
"From the get-go, you'll know that this is a film that relies almost solely on its style and its visual slickness. Low budget in the good sense, Versus resembles early Sam Raimi or Peter Jackson works (Bad Taste springs primarily to mind). It combines good-humored gore with Luc Besson-ish wide lens shots and quirkiness (the characters here reminded me of The Boondock Saints in their flamboyance), along with some very creative martial arts sequences. At some point, in fact, it gets so over-the-top it starts to play out more like a Stephen Chow movie. It then jumps from Night of the Living Dead to Mortal Kombat to Highlander, making a stop or two at X-Men along the way. This eastern/western mix works surprisingly well and the result is highly entertaining, if you enjoy this kind of thing. Just don't go looking for any depth, causality, plot logic, or plot altogether, really. The few dialogue scenes are a mess (excluding the one that takes place when everything turns an orange shade, about an hour into the film), and often serve only as a backdrop for canted steadicam close-ups and multi-character Mexican standoffs. This is not high brow cinema, it's high octane. And it was perfectly fine by me. It is when the film discards some of its humor that it begins to lose its charm, but even then, the spectacularly choreographed martial arts kept me entertained. I would be interested in seeing ""The Ultimate Versus""  a director's cut that's ten minutes longer and has CGI special effects, according to IMDb.P.S. There are few things I hate more than a dubbed movie, but in this case (like in Shaolin Soccer), I found that at certain scenes (particularly ones involving ""the runt""  the wacky short guy), the English dubbing actually adds to the absurdity of the film. Anyway, the DVD offers both the American and the original Japanese dialogue tracks.",positive
"I just finished seeing this film.  Really interesting camera shots makes film feel like it's in another dimension or on another planet.  It also estahblished an eerie, spooky atmosphere and gives a very haunting setting. The good guys can fight, the bad guys (including several Yakuza) aren't afraid to battle, and there are zombies.  As the film goes on, the zombies aren't really the main problem the hero faces.The action scenes in this movie are wild, intense, and can sometimes put a guilty grin on your face.  Whether it's sword slicing, bullets blazing, or good old fashioned martial arts, the pace is frenetic and really establishes the characters well.  Although a few scenes are paced slower, the action here ties it all together.  This is the first time I've seen Zombies in combat who actually put up a great fight.  The main part of the story unfolds during the second half and the ending is creative and original. Versus is unlike any movie I've previously seen.I must've repeated to my friend that the soundtrack for Versus is really cool and it complements the fight scenes fanatic pace.  Cool fashion, good amount of gore, and an interesting storyline.  Definitely an film not to be missed.",positive
"You can't beat that combination, unless you add in ninjas, or samurai... or Godzilla, but zombies and yakuza alone make a very compelling film, even if it has no sensible plot.The storyline is simple enough - prisoners escape, get double crossed, then find out they're in a ""forest of resurrection"" full of zombies that don't like yakuza very much. That's all you really need to know.Sit back and relax as you watch hilarious gory and impossibly bad acting. The movie is based on its visual appeal alone, forget the plot and the characters, watch the fight scenes, the strange standoffs, bad monologues, and hideously bad acting.There are parts, however, where the movie drags on a bit. Killing zombies, even though enormously awesome, does become monotonous after an extended period. But these lulls are few and far between them. The action definitely keeps you hooked for most of the film.Overall? Great action film.7/10",negative
"Mix in equal parts Highlander and a Zombie flick and you end up with this cult classic from Japan.The central premise is admittedly great; the idea of the 666 portals to our world and especially the 444th portal concerned here 'The Forest Of Resurrection' is suitably spooky. In addition, the notion of the perpetually reincarnated warriors battling down throughout the centuries is super cool. Unfortunately, despite the above awesome premise and in addition even having now watched this film three times, each time having tried desperately hard to enjoy it, I ultimately just cannot appreciate what all the fuss is about. To be fair there are some excellent sequences included throughout, especially the scenes set in the past wherein our hero bravely faces overwhelming odds, battling to the bitter end against hoards of zombies and his immortal nemesis.So what went wrong? Well lets start with the characters....The hero in this is to put it mildly, bland at best and was presumably chosen for the part solely based upon his looks. The end result is that given such a boring hero, I found myself actually rooting for the main bad guy in this (who doesn't actually show up until well into the films proceedings!!!) who let's face it, is MUCH cooler anyway!Aside from our decidedly lacklustre hero we also get 'treated' to some particularly annoying characters throughout this. For one there is a horribly dressed psycho who particularly irritated the hell out of me! I'm sure the actor playing him was having a ball with his zany character but damn - the character was a veritable pain in the ass! Also of (non)note is the annoying, whining, diminutive fool who keeps accidentally shooting his fellow comrades, the peculiarly hopeless woman who is reincarnated along with our leads throughout the centuries and upon whose blood will decide the fate of the world and the pointless addition of a number of peripheral characters such as a pair of comic relief agents.The film is mainly celebrated as an action fest and admittedly it does deliver some excellent set pieces throughout. However it has to be said that even these get a bit repetitive as time goes on. The stylised gun play as our protagonists empty seemingly limitless rounds into their undead assailants (and at each other!) does become tiresome after the umpteenth time. In addition despite many reviews I have read to the contrary, the martial arts in this are most definitely not as spectacular as I had been led to believe. In fact it is quite clear upon viewing this, that the majority of relevant actors here are not trained martial artists at all (including the lead), instead they are bolstered via various cinematic tricks such as fast editing in order to compensate.The single biggest flaw in this for me though is the running time which is drastically too long and drags on severely. In fact, had this film been condensed down by about half an hour (or preferably more) I would have awarded this a much higher rating.Although an overall sadly unfulfilling watch I must however comment on and commend the excellent open ending in this which seems to reverse the main protagonists roles as the 'game' begins again in the future - great stuff (including the souped up swords!)Whilst highly recommend by so many and boasting such a huge cult following, try as I might, I simply cannot derive the same enjoyment from this that so many others report to have.Oh well, maybe the supposed sequel will be better....",negative
"Some people are insane! I mean, what were you expecting? The English Patient? I for one love a good gorefest and awesome if its done out of Hollywood. The plot had holes, I guess, I can't really think of anything that really had me come out of the movie. If you rented or bought this and thought, ""Hey, that couldn't have happened, like, oh my Gawd how fake!"" Why would you watch a zombie/sci-fi movie to begin with? You did read the synopses right? The acting was good, watch the original undubbed one please before you blast the flick! The characters were priceless, I loved the ""Charlie's Angels""-esquire stances the yakuza guys made! Tre cool. I loved the fighting as well, every ten minutes or so someone was getting the crap beat out of them. It was also very refreshing to not see so much wire-flying, the one part I can recall that did sort of do that was shot tightly so it didn't seem so exaggerated. I'm a chick and I LOVED how Prisonor KSC2-303 kept hitting the annoying chick over the head, classic! No out of nowhere love scenes here my good people! The ""villian"" was also top-notch. I thought the casting was great. Tak Sakaguchi, wow, baby don't be so mean! :P I can't wait to see him in more things or in the sequel. Please don't watch this if you're cynical or hard to please. ITS A ZOMBIE/GORE/SCI-FI INDIE FILM! Yeah just don't buy it, let someone else who appreciates such fineness get a copy.*By the by, this review is based on ""The Ultimate Versus"" edition.",positive
"This movie actually turned out to be cooler than I expected. I really didn't know what to expect when I was first about to watch this. I only knew it had some zombies,and had something to do with a portal and reincarnation. Its also totally campy, very bloody and gory, and one of the more memorable characters in it. The guy who runs around and screams all the time is hilarious. The dialog is cheesy. It has a decent story to it. Its just a fun movie. The visuals will keep you glued by themselves. This is a very low budget movie, but just remember , if you go to watch it, have no expectations. This movie will make you say "" What the F"" more than make you think. There is also a nice shot at Matrix movies too. Pretty cool movie and I in no way expected the movie to end the way it did. I wonder if there is more to come?",positive
"There are 666 concealed portals that connect the world of the living to the world of the dead. In Japan, two prisoners runaway through the Forest of Resurrection, where the 444th portal is located, to meet a group of criminals that had organized their escape. One of the convicts sees a kidnapped young woman and argues with the leader of the gangsters. There is a shooting, and one of the mobsters is killed. However, a couple of minutes later, the dead rises and attacks his former mates. They realize the resurrection power of the forest, and the criminals become concerned, since they used the location to dump their victims in the spot. Suddenly they are attacked by a great number of zombies and have to fight to survive. But when the boss of the gangsters arrives, the survivor prisoner sees that his fate is to fight against his opponent.The cult ""Versus"" is a gruesome, insane, gore and bizarre zombie movie. The brainless non-sense story is shot in one location in the woods, is full of action, very funny, fast paced and entertaining, with great choreography of the fights. The anti-hero has killed forty-three persons, faces very cruel bad guys (but we never hear their names), rescues the girl saying that he is feminist, but hits her head every time he needs to fight, meaning all the time. The leader of the bad guys with the knife is very funny and I had a lot of fun with this original film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Portal da Ressurreição"" (""The Portal of Resurrection"")Note: On 08 Dec 2020 I saw this film again.",positive
"The contribution that Japan has made to the world of screen violence can hardly be overstated, and in the 21st Century there seems to be a new renaissance of sheer bloodiness. Movies like BATTLE ROYALE, ICHI THE KILLER and VERSUS really set new standards for out and out shocking violence that I don't think any other country in the world has matched.
VERSUS is basically all about action. The premise is a crazy one that involves kung-fu samurais re-incarnated as yakuza who then get turned into zombies and vampires. It's actually a very interesting and quite complex story in its own right, but basically it's an excuse to get a bunch of people in a forest and stage a fairly continuous sequence of hand to hand fights, sword fights and gun fights - with a supernatural angle to justify some HK style OTT acrobatics and an undead angle to justify people getting seriously messed up and still fighting on. Genius. Sick as all hell, but genius!These days, good action movies from Hong Kong are becoming increasingly rare. For years HK stood unchallenged and exported its unique cinematic arts throughout Asia. Since the talent or the investment or the will or whatever seems to have fled the HK industry in recent years, it seems like other Asian countries are stepping up to the challenge of filling the gap. Korea has produced movies like MUSA and MY WIFE IS A GANGSTER, Thailand has produced BANGKOK DANGEROUS and TAK 4, INDIA has produced AANKHEN and MISSION KASHMIR. Hollywood and Europe have had a go too, but with so little success overall it's hardly worth mentioning.VERSUS is clearly made by a small independant team who recognised that Hong Kong isn't going to produce the next jaw-dropping action movie any time soon, and who believed they had what it took to do it instead. It takes a lot of confidence and dedication to produce results like these on a clearly low budget, and Napalm Films must have had a lot of both. VERSUS attempts practically every type of action scene that Hong Kong has been famous for (and Japan traditionally has not), and pulls most of them off very well.
There'd been such a lot of hype around VERSUS on the net for ages that I'd found myself instinctively hating it before I knew anything about it, but when I saw the trailer I was converted to enthusiasm. Seeing the wild disparity between the cool SHIRAYUKI HIME trailer and the dreadful full length movie gave me some trepidation about VERSUS, which is probably a good thing since at least I wasn't expecting something flawless. VERSUS is not flawless, but it's much much better than SHIRAYUKI HIME.
The action scenes are not better than Hong Kong's best - they're not even nearly as good as some of the scenes in movies like MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS in fact, but they're imaginatively and enthusiastically staged and filmed. And violent! Oh so very very violent! The special effects are some of the most convincingly brutal I've seen. ICHI THE KILLER may have had more outrageous effects, but was never in danger of having convincing effects. BATTLE ROYALE may have had more realistic violence, but nothing like the sheer magnitude of the bodily damage people take in VERSUS! People get cut in half, lose limbs, have gaping holes blown through them... well, you know how much it takes to stop a zombie moving . It's all played fairly non-seriously, but not to the cartoonish extent of ICHI. It looks pretty damn real.
Definitely not one for the squeamish, really not a family movie. But for the sick puppies out there who maintain an innocent curiosity as to just how violent a movie can be (like myself, I admit), VERSUS is definitely a must-see!",positive
"This movie, while made to be an action type with some subtle humor, grades pretty low to folks looking for an action movie to snuggle up with and watch alone. This movie is much, much more fun to watch with others, preferably with a sense of humor. If you're not a fan of action, and are looking for anything remotely deep and meaningful, look someplace else.The movie is shot entirely in a forest setting, with the times shifting from morning to twilight frequently.The action is very well put together despite being on an obvious low budget. I recommend this movie to anyone with a few hours to kill with a few friends.",positive
"Boy, oh, boy. They don't make them like this anymore and boy, do I wish I had written this flick. This is a movie living and breathing (so to speak) cult following. ""Versus"" is a thrilling, fast and furious action-horror-comedy-martial arts actioner directed by Ryuhei Kitamara and features a bizarre and original plot line that's virtually nonexistent.The irony is, even though it's original, the film spends very little time explaining its more complicated bits and gets great mileage out of the Japanese actors, none of whom have real names, other than two or three-word descriptions like the grungy, tough-talking anti-hero ""Prisoner KSC2-303"" or ""The Girl"" or ""Yakuza Leader with Butterfly Knife."" Real deep characters, huh?The plot is simple, if confusing, and all seven minutes of it occur within the first few scenes: In Japan's ""Forest of Resurrection,"" two escaped convicts are on their way to making a rendezvous with a group of fellow gangsters. A shoot-out occurs over a disagreement between KSC2 and the Yakuza leader regarding a kidnapped young woman in the trunk of his car - The Girl; one of the men is killed, and so is KSC2's buddy.KSC2 and The Girl run off into the forest, but after he, and each of the gangsters put 50 bullets into the reanimated corpses of KSC2's buddy and the dead gangster. Soon, KSC2, The Girl, and the gangsters realize something is not right about the woods they had set up as a prearranged meeting spot, and it isn't long before they're all emptying clip after clip into the zombified corpses rising up from their shallow graves in the forest floor. (On a side note, I don't think any of the gangsters ever run out of ammunition.)As it would turn out, the gangsters have been using the forest as a burial ground for their victims, and they're coming back to settle a score with their killers. Since this is the Forest of Resurrection, all the bodies of slain gangsters are rising from the dead and fighting against their living enemies. That's about all there is to the plot, and all you need to know.This is a strange gem right here, folks. I don't think there's single production in Hollywood that could touch this movie in terms of style and subject matter. It looks fantastic, really giving the woods a life of its own (so to speak), and the mood of the film is effectively surreal. (It kind of reminds me of ""The Evil Dead"" in a few ways.) ""Versus"" ultimately plays out like a collision between every low-budget zombie movie, John Woo shoot-'em-up picture, and action movie we've ever seen. Now in Hollywood, ladies and gentlemen, we call that originality.""Versus"" is a skillful blend of each genre and it never loses sight of the main conflict between escaped convicts and gangsters; the zombies are merely a nuisance - who at first appear to be an interference with shadowy gangland activities. But as it would turn out, however, there's more to the story, and the Forest of Resurrection, as well as the zombies somehow figure into a plot that's best explained by the main villain of the picture, a stranger who I presume is The Man (since as I said before none of the characters have real names), who seeks The Girl to use her in his quest to achieve immortality, or something like that.It's also pretty funny too. Much of the comedy in this movie arises from one panicky gangster member and two horribly disfigured police officers (whom I'm not sure are dead and resurrected or just badly injured) who have vowed to bring down the escaped convicts. And the corny one-liners (ever-present in the American dubbed version) will definitely get you laughing at its attempts to sound cool to our braindead audiences.Even though ""Verses"" is not rated, it's extremely bloody with enough over-the-top gore to please any American gorehound or fan of zombie pictures. It's also got enough martial arts action and Woo-style gunplay to satisfy anyone who's gone into the film thinking this is a samurai picture (from looking at the DVD cover art).""Versus"" will definitely win on the cult circuit; whether it's ready to take on the American mainstream is a question that only time will answer. We'll just have to wait and see who the winner of that titanic battle will be...7/10",positive
"For a unconventional movie events play out very carefully except for the strange ending! This type of movie doesn't need much of a plot! Still there is a little story told in between the action to keep it interesting! This movie is about fun! Action and fun! Zombies against very unfriendly characters! The characters portrayed are all evil! But still you will like them. The characters don't take themselves to seriously and that's what makes all the ridiculous stuff acceptable! There is this police officer who keeps bragging to his partner! Before the end this officer is part of a parody on ""The Matrix"" (the bullet dodge scene on the roof). He shouts that he cannot be hurt because he is 500 times faster than Mike Tyson! You see him dodge like Neo in ""The Matrix"" and gets blown away! This is an example of the humor you can expect! Empty your mind and just watch and you will enjoy this movie!",positive
"Ryuhei Kitamura has created a cult classic that this viewer (and probably many others) will never forget. Not only was this one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had, it was actually a good movie as well. For the record, I usually hate action movies and try to stay away from them. When an action movie is a success it is usually an outstanding movie (""Die Hard"", ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Terminator"") but when they are bad they are abysmal. ""Versus"" falls into the former category and for me, is probably one of the best action movies ever made. Not only does it also blend horror, comedy and fantasy extremely well, it disregards story and logic for some awesome fighting scenes which is what an action movie is all about.....action! For what little story there is: the 444th (out 666) gate to hell is located in Japan, more precisely the ""Forest of Resurrection."" Two escaped prisoners meet a gang to escape but when it all goes wrong and one of the two prisoners ends up dead, it's up to Prisoner KSC2-303 to fulfill his destiny and fight ""The Man."" Really, there isn't much of a plot to tell. My summary is very vague for a reason, watching this movie for the first time not knowing much is better. What the plot is really there for is to stage many fights involving guns, knives, fists, samurai swords, shotguns, bloody stumps and a sniper rifle. These fights are choreographed very well and feature some outstanding gore effects. On the topic of gore, this movie is full of it, probably one of the goriest movies I've ever seen and will please fans of splatter movies. Zombies are even included and since I love a good zombie movie this was also a treat for me.As the movie progresses it gets more ludicrous and fun. Many bits had me laughing out loud and others just amazed at the fight scenes which are truly amazing. ""Versus"" is much like Peter Jackson and Sam Raimi's early works, movies like ""Braindead"", ""Bad Taste"", ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"" will no doubt enjoy every moment of this movie. If there is a sequel in the works, this reviewer is extremely excited.5/5",positive
"I hesitated long before I finally decided to see this movie. ""Battle Royale"" had been my last positive experience with Asian cinema and movies like ""The Eye"" and ""Uzumaki"" really turned me off. Besides, I was getting tired of martial arts and feared that ""Versus"" is going to be one long, boring opera of Kung Fu fighting. Thank God, the movie could prove me wrong. ""Versus"" is more a parody than anything else, but with really good fighting scenes. I compared the movie with ""Evil Dead"" in the headline, because obviously both movies play in the woods, feature zombies and don't lack humor. They have something else in common. Both flicks were made with little budget, which you don't see at all. The special effects, the actors and the directors in ""Versus"" are top noch. I can't point out enough, how much I appreciate the comedy aspect of the movie and how the makers managed to mix that comedy with action and story. The ending is a little controversial.SPOILERS:My explanation is that 99 years later, the good brother turned evil and the reincarnation of the villain is now good. If there's a deeper meaning behind that, then it may be that every man that is given power will abuse this power. The ending could also say that established things will eventually turn bad until they are knocked over by new and fresh ideas.END OF SPOILERS & PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHTS.The only bad thing I can say about the movie is that it could have been a little shorter. Also, the story lacked logic at times, but story is not what ""Versus"" is about. It's about fun and gore and, boy, you get both!",positive
"Some guys out filming in the woods with a camera and added zombiesno, it's not the latest in a long line of BLAIR WITCH derivatives, but instead another low-budget Japanese slice of mayhem that follows in the same undead vein as WILD ZERO and JUNK. VERSUS takes the flesh-eating dead from the Romero movies and transplants them slap-bang into the middle of a tale involving yakuza vendettas, escaped convicts and an age-old sorcerer with plans for immortality. If it sounds overbaked and half-crazy, that's because it is.I really like these low-budget Japanese movies as they have a tendency to overcome their budgetary constraints, making up for a lack of cash with an influx of creative energy. The last one I watched was a glorious Tarantino rip-off called SCORE. VERSUS follows the same formula, dishing up some familiar ingredients and giving them extra jolts of vitality which brings a storyline you might have seen before back to outrageous (un)life.The characters are crazed, larger than life creations and the actors go way above and beyond the call of duty in their roles, but somehow the over-the-top nature of the performances work. Ryuhei Kitamura keeps his cameras moving all over the place, creating novel shot after novel shot, and the (many) action sequences are elaborately staged and completely exhilarating. It's a real shame when you watch a movie with a budget hundreds of times larger than the one here making crucial mistakes, like dodgy shaky-cam scenes or fights that are just plain dull. VERSUS may be silly, cheesy and rough around the edgesbut it's never dull!",positive
"Versus is a movie that defies the odds- what odds for sure I don't know- and cements its place as one of those cult films you hear from time to time, but then when you see it you understand the hype. It's so excessively violent and against the grain of anything meant to be taken an iota seriously that it welcomes it being as much a comedy as a horror film. I'm not totally sure that's what the filmmakers intended, but they've got Versus in that same cross-hairs I found a flick like Riki-Oh to be in, where violence is abstracted completely from reality, despite the heap-loads of blood meant, supposedly, to be realistic. There's nothing realistic about Versus, as it's a supernatural wild-card of sorts that combines zombies and yakuza in one package tinted with some possible Japanese folklore. The director Ryuhei Kitamura is very aware of how his camera can move around in an action scene- perhaps dangerously close on too aware- and makes his style hyper-kinetic but never annoying or too boring. While he lacks a real polish in shooting dialog scenes (jiggly hand-held camera, already with the dubbing that comes from seeing it on TV, never a good idea), Kitamura is a born and bred director of cartoonishly gory action scenes, where body parts get severed like it's breathing, and there's so many guns on display, and so many bullets fired, and so many swords clanged and clashed, and a good share of hearts ripped out and heads decapitated (some of said head's faces that give meaningful glances before being knocked dead), one doesn't want it to stop after a while.Even the dialog sometimes gets very big enjoyment, if not through the main characters (the lead guy, who is an amnesiac who's soul dates back to that of the villain, a sorcerer who after conjuring hundreds of zombies is looking for blood to make him somehow immortal in the Forest of Resurrection), then through supporting ones. There's the typical wormy guy who's part of the yakuza, but goes through the movie scared out of his wits and with a face of red blood; you might think that would make him more of a bad-ass, but not so, not against his female adversary anyway. There's also the best side character, an FBI agent from Yellowstone National Park (which may or may not be in Canada), who also claims to be five times stronger than Mike Tyson. It's a good thing that characters like these, and the villain to an extent, go for the absurd, because it's a lot to swallow, a lot of it hard to follow or without much consequence anyway, in terms of the actual story. It might appeal to die-hard fans or even to those of video games to which Versus has gone on to influence, but it's not story that should be of major concern here, not when the seeming romance between female spirit and lunk-head with a past life is meant to be taken seriously and when the yakuza who early on seems like the true villain turns soon into a zombie toad.No, Versus is best as one thing and one thing alone- pure, hilarious adrenaline. Although Kitamura's work ratchets the tension, it's never a tension that mounts steadily; his characters are too lackadaisical in the midst of zombies circling around them to load their weapons to really earn that tension. It's when the s*** goes down and suddenly attitude gets put to the test with equaled skills as fighters and shooters. It all adds up to being a great guilty pleasure, one where the feeling of admiration and kicking yourself silly over it all comes also with a feeling of 'is this really worth it, this trashy stuff'. But as trash, when it comes down to it, could be a lot worse, or boring. Versus is the kind of disposable malarkey that would be sweet to see again at 3 in the morning, staying up all the way to the end, which for some reason or another skips ahead to ""99 Years Later""! 7.5/10",positive
"Delirius, no-holds-barred, full-throttle fantasy action, from director Ryûhei Kitamura(Midnight Meat Train)has a prisoner(Tak Sakaguchi, whose crime is never revealed)caught in the cross-hairs of a crime gang, within a supernatural wilderness(Wilderness of Resurrection)which is a limbo-of-sorts to ""the other side"", a darkness which can be unlocked by two keys, as undead zombies(..the buried targets of this criminal Yakuza-type of group)rise from their graves(..some with guns still on their person!). The Prisoner(..known in number as KSC2-303)doesn't know where he had just came from and this woman(Chieko Misaka)seems to have answers. The woman was sent to the wilderness by a mysterious boss(Hideo Sakaki)who hasn't arrived, with the Prisoner(..along with a partner who also escaped;a decapitated hand along with him!)squaring off with the Yakuza members in a gun battle. KSC2-303's partner is killed after he murdered one of the Yakuza. Retreating into the wilderness, KSC2-303 and the woman must contend with not only the Yakuza, with heavy artillery, but zombies as well. Meanwhile, the boss arrives, and his motivations soon become known..he is the reincarnation of a great warrior who wishes to achieve his mission of using the mixed blood of KSC2-303 and the woman, hoping to gain access to the other side.The ridiculous plot, which is essentially a live action manga comic, doesn't really matter because director Ryûhei Kitamura is more concerned with entertaining the audience with non stop action, whether it be Matrix-like combats, sword-fighting or shootouts. It's all rather exhilarating and high-octane, with a pace that moves breakneck as the characters, colorful and cartoonish, strike hip poses and engage in mano-a-mano contests, with plenty of body blows, legs and arms moving at impossible speeds, blood shed(..as expected, the blood looks like kool-aid), and grisly aftermaths of graphic violence. Hideo Sakaki is so powerful he punches a hole through a victim's skull with such force he pulls away eyeballs. A heavy gun actually blows two victims to smithereens. Swords lop off heads. Zombie carnage aplenty as bullets rip them to shreds as they continue moving towards live humans who keep shooting rounds. The showdown between Sakaguchi and Sakaki delivers a sword-fighting ballet, carefully executed, exciting and riveting. The film's tone is rather light-hearted and even goofy at times, and the violence remains almost entirely tongue-in-cheek, and the characters display incredible skill as Sakaguchi always faces challenges from opposing forces. The wilderness setting is ideal for such a thrill-ride, and gorehounds will bask in the heaping helping of grue on display for our viewing pleasure. Not for those looking for a cohesive plot that makes any sense, but for undemanding fans of dizzying action, animated characterizations, and flashy camera work(..Ryûhei Kitamura is in love with the ""spiral camera shot""), with expert editing, this will be sure to please. Kitamura pulls out all the stops, bound and determined to provide as much exhausting action as possible. If there's a way to kill a person, Kitamura shows it.",positive
"People hyped the heck out of this movie, but I can't attribute my disappointment to that. I've seen a lot of movies that weren't as good as the hype but still ended up being enjoyable... Versus does not fit that bill.This is not a good movie. It has a very interesting plot, and would definitely make a good anime... but there is just so much... well, stupidity. This story could have been told just as well (and probably would've been a LOT more enjoyable) in, literally, half the time. The characters are more like caricatures than people -- which would be OK if it weren't taken so far as to get in the way of the movie. I just couldn't take any of them seriously. I guess it would be enjoyable if you were, I don't know, really into gore and really, really high, but that's about it. I don't mind gore... but if you're not a BIG fan of it, portions of this movie will definitely make you roll your eyes.While the story is cool (and I did like the ending), there is a whole lot of empty space where there's basically nothing but zombies running around and getting blown to pieces. I'm generally a fan of zombie movies, but give me a break; we don't even get the typical ""shoot them in the head until they fall down."" They take a random number of bullets or dismemberment and just randomly die with no rhyme or reason.Oh, and these zombies use swords. And guns. And kung freaking fu. I guess this would be cool if anything else in this movie had ANY kind of cohesion, but it doesn't, so this feels like just another ""well, we felt like it, so they can do it"" bit.There are... I guess you would call them protagonists... a couple of government agents who should be at least a relatively major plot point. They get... ten? Fifteen minutes of air time? I can't stress how completely ridiculous the characters are. There are three that actually have substance... kind of... and only because they are THE main characters (you won't know who they are until half way through the movie, which makes it slightly more bearable). Everyone else is crazy. Completely insane. That is not an exaggeration. It's fun at first, but once you realize that there really are only three important characters in this film, it gets very boring and very repetitive.The camera work starts off very, very badly. I was gratified when the director decided to stop using a hand-held camcorder. There might have been some kind of significance to this, but I was too busy trying to be interested to get that far into it.There's just not much reason to watch this. There's some good fighting, but so much of it is filmed REALLY badly that there are only one or two fights that are enjoyable. The hand-to-hand fights are definitely a plus, and are one of the only reasons this didn't get a 1 from me.I hated to hate this movie. I love zombie flicks, martial arts, gunfights, mythology of all sorts, horror movies, subtitles and Japanese chicks. This movie tried, and could have been/had all of the above, but failed dismally on all fronts.3.5/10... rounded down for IMDb, because this doesn't have the entertainment value for a 4.",negative
"Versus starts 500 years ago somewhere in Japan where after killing a load of zombies some guy is cut in half by another guy. Cut to the present where escaped prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) & another prisoner (Motonari Komiya) are on the run in the middle of the ominous sounding Forest of Resurrection where they plan to meet up with a group of men who will lead them to safety. A guy on a motor bike (Yuichiro Arai) & four men in a car turn up. As they stand there arguing about another person who should turn up soon they reveal that they have kidnapped a young woman (Chieko Misaka), KSC2-303 rescues her & kills one of the men (Ryosuke Watabe) who then comes back to life & has to be killed again. The leader of the men (Kenji Matsuda) then shoots the other prisoner who also comes back to life, at this point KSC2-303 & the woman make a run for it. As the men pursue them zombies start to rise from the ground & a mysterious man (Hideo Sakaki) turns up whom appears to be invincible & seems to know what's going on as he reveals that everyone is here for a reason & that he plans to open a portal to 'the other side' which will grant him immense power...This American, Japanese co-production was co-written & directed by Ryuhei Kitamura & is a pretty entertaining film. The script by Kitamura & Yudai Yamaguchi is almost indefinable as it's a bit of a mis-mash of genres, a bit of everything seems to be in here somewhere from martial arts & horror to comedy & romance. To give credit where it's due Versus mixes & balances the different aspects well to produce a very watchable film even if when it comes down to it there isn't much to it overall. The character's are thin & a bit one-dimensional & for some strange reason no-one is ever given any on screen name, but they are likable enough except the two annoying comedy cops (Shoichiro Masumoto & Yukihito Tanikado) who seem out of place & very clichéd. It moves along at a nice pace & it never becomes either boring or dull, far from it in fact as there seems to be a blood soaked over-the-top fight every couple of minutes. The fight scenes are excellent & are full of pace, flair, cool stunts & outrageous moves. Technically Versus is very good particularly when you consider the mere $400,000 budget, a special mention goes to the inventive cinematography by Takumi Furuya which is almost a character in itself. There are some great shots, camera angles & there's a real visual excellence & energy about Versus as the camera never seems to stay still. Director Kitamura likes to circle round his actors & keep his camera moving whenever possible while he isn't shy to use moody slow-motion, I love the overall look & dynamic visuals of this film. The production design is great as well, Versus is all about being cool with funky hair styles, clothes, facial hair, sunglasses, long leather trench-coats, sexy chrome guns & over-the-top weaponry including the coolest samurai swords you'll ever likely see. The special effects are fine with some gory fights although the gore levels aren't as high as I was expecting, there's a severed hand, holes punched & blown through people's bodies, rotting zombies, heart ripping & eating, decapitation, someone getting splattered as they are run over, plenty of gory gunshot wounds & blood gushing sword fights. There is buckets of blood in Versus but little in the way of actual explicit gore is what I'm trying to say. The acting is OK but I don't understand Japanese so I can't really say how the actors delivered their lines & there is very little dialogue in it anyway so don't let the subtitles put you off as you won't have to read much. On the negative side the forest setting which accounts for probably 99% of the films location is a bit bland & becomes tiresome after a while. I liked Versus, it moves along at a great pace is never boring & features some fantastic fights & action scenes while having that cool comic book feel & visual flair throughout. Highly recommended for pure mindless entertaining fun!",positive
"I'm beginning to wonder if people feel that they're going to look stupid if they say a foreign film is bad. That is the only possible explanation I can think of as to why Versus could have an IMDb average over three. I really can't fathom how any true film-lover could actually find anything of value in this dung-heap. Versus is proof that not all foreign movies are amazing. Furthermore, Versus is proof that foreign movies can occasionally the most wretched tripe ever committed to celluloid.By the way, I am not going to refer to this atrocity as a ""film"" at any point in this review  it doesn't deserve to be dignified with that. I'm relegating this one to ""movie"", a term I normally try to avoid.Anyway, this Japanese mangling has a ridiculously convoluted plot involving zombies and Samurai reincarnated as criminals. There's also some subplot about some girl's blood resurrecting something-or-otherit's all just a big mess that I don't really care to remember. Now you're probably wondering how a movie about Samurai, criminals, and zombies can be so terrible. I had a hard time believing it too, but there is no subject matter immune to incompetent filmmakers. Versus feels like the bastard spawn of a group of ADD-ridden fifteen-year-olds who do nothing but play videogames and down can after can of Mountain Dew, all while listening to techno music. We have a group of overly stylized (not to mention extremely clichéd) characters that wear sunglasses and a lot of leather. We have martial arts fight scene after drawn-out martial arts fight scene. We have a lot of pointless violence. We have a lot of slow-motion shots trying to mimic The Matrix. We have a lot of over-the-top gore. Yes, not even the high gore factor could save this pile of crap.All the hyper-slo-mo-Matrix-kung-fu shots really just began to give me a bad headache after about, oh, ten minutes. And if it wasn't bad enough to get through already, the movie is actually 119 minutes long. That's about 119 minutes longer than it should be.Hell, if you think Uwe Boll movies are bad, you ain't seen nothing' yet. It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad. In fact, this is quite possibly the single most god-awful movie I've ever seen. The absolute only reason I sat through the entire train-wreck was because I don't believe in rating a film if one has not viewed it in its entirety  and I just could not pass up giving this piece of garbage the grade it deserves. That, obviously, is a huge, resounding F.",negative
"My pals and I love these kind of movies but really - it's all style, it's all camera moves, it's all film school hard-on CRAP and there really is nothing there. The main idea - that these woods where these gangsters are - are full of portals to the other side and the dead can immediately re-animate, etc. that's all fine, but aside from that - it is just endless fights, endless bad Tarantino/John Woo with dozens of scenes with guns pointed at people's faces, this one actor playing a gangster does some of the worst overacting I've ever seen; mugging, grimacing, flapping his hands about, oh man, I kept waiting for him to die - it's as if he watched Benicio Del Toro and Marlon Brando on a loop and just started impersonating them. But look, you can splatter all the blood you want, show holes going clean through torsos and heads, martial arts til the cows come home, but there is NONE and I mean NONE character development at all - not a shred. And the female lead is one of the wost actresses with a puffy face that would stop a clock. We hung in there til the end but I was glad to read that others had a hard time making it through. There are just so many better movies like this - Evil Dead, Dead Alive, Night of The Living Dead, Riki o, etc.",negative
"Versus is a nonstop action film that combines old school sword play with a new age shooting rampage. Directed by Ryuhei Kitamura this explosively unique movie has brought the director a lot of fame because it is very different from any other movie in this genre.The film begins with two men who break out of prison seeking cover in the forest of resurrection unknowingly these men are about to get involved in a struggle between good and evil that has been going on since the beginning of time its self.Ryuhei Kitamuras artistic insight and some excellent cinematography made this film the camera angles, use of color, and humorous situations create a very enjoyable film.I loved this movie I would recommend any and every one to watch it, the plot was very unique and inventive it has a bit of everything action, adventure, comedy, and zombies.",positive
"I wish I could get my hands on the people who left favorable reviews for this movie. What a waste of precious time. - And to show I'm not an unreasonable movie viewer, I'd like you to know that some of my favorite movies include: ""Dead Alive"", ""Story of Ricky"", and ""Mr.Vampire"".
1. The entire frickin' movie is filmed in the woods. I mean that literally. There are no buildings, structures, and even the view of the blue sky is limited. With the mounds of dirt lying around you almost expect to see a new home development going in over the rise. The times we do see the sun it is a various locations, even amidst the same scene.2. The Plot:  What plot?  -  They seemed to have tried to combine elements of ""The Matrix"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and thought it would be this blockbuster. And remember while trying to visualize these concepts, that it's all taking place in the same area of the frickin' woods! (NOTE: The only redeeming qualities of this movie are the attempts to mimic the fight scenes in ""The Matrix"", and the gore by far was the best. There were some hilarious parts (they probably weren't meant to be). The good guy, who's name just happens to be Destiny, by the end of the movie is wearing all black (ala Neo), and is even brought to the brink of death just like in ""The Matrix"". Two of the bad guys are supposed to be agents (ala Agent Smith). One says he was trained by the FBI at Langley AFB, the other says he was born and raised in Yellowstone National Park. The explanation for the zombies is that they are all the dead and buried men that the hoodlum hitmen assassinated and buried in the woods. Oh, but these aren't ordinary woods, it's the ""Resurrection Forest""! - Yeah, that explains things alot?3. The sound track is abysmal. Was definitely made by one musician using a synthesizer, and you could tell at times he tried to mimic the techno-noir of ""The Matrix"".NOTE: Once again, don't forget to picture this all occurring in the same frickin' woods. They even run over the same spots time and time again.Anyway, my head hurts telling you all this! I think I've gotta pop in a copy of ""Ringu"", ""Battle Royale"", or even ""Godzilla(the original) just so I can go to bed feeling like the day wasn't a total waste.Remember, you've been warned about this one, and for God's sake, stay out of the ""frickin' woods""!",negative
"I came across versus by chance, and thought that the premise described on the back of the DVD sounded interesting. I enjoy watching all kinds of film genres, so I thought ""why not?! If it's bad I'll just stop watching"". I popped it in my DVD player and was thoroughly entertained for the next two hours or so.The gist of the story is: Two convicts who manage to escape their police escorts, run into a forest to meet up with some shady looking Yakuzas, who they believe will take them to a safe place. The lead character who is only known as Prisoner KSC2-303 (please note none of the characters have names) doesn't quite trust them, especially when he finds out that they have brought a kidnapped girl along for the ride. There is a stand off. Insults are exchanged (I especially enjoyed Prisoner KSC2-303's comments).Guns are fired, and one of the yakuzas as well as the other convict are shot, and consequently come back to life as zombies. We later find out that the head yakuza that shows up a little later in the film, is a five hundred year old demon/vampire/sorcerer who wants to open the gates of hell and thus gain incredible power. In order to do so, he needs the girl's blood (isn't that always the way?). It seems that the forest they are in, is the 444th portal to hell.It is also known as the forest of resurrection where the dead come back to life. It's also a popular burial ground for people the yakuzas have bumped off over the years. So as one might guess, there are a whole bunch of zombies walking around (with loaded guns I might add). What follows are a lot of fights; knife fights, gun fights, hand to hand combat, fights with big samurai swords. Everybody in this film fights. Even the girl who is supposed to be completely helpless manages to hit a few people. There are many more details that I have left out, as that would give away all the plot twists. IMHO, the less you known about the film the more likely it is that you will enjoy it.As well as action and gore (there is plenty of gore) the film has a lot of humorous moments that I think work really well (they had me giggling). The action is great. The fight choreography is well executed, particularly the final fight between prisoner ksc2-303 and the main ""bad"" guy. The acting was also quite good. I liked the performances from the two male leads. However, there was one performance that to begin with was rather amusing, but went slightly over the top towards the end (if you watch this film, then you will know who I'm talking about). Overall, this is a really fun, funny and enjoyable film, which manages to blend a whole range of genres rather competently.It may not be everyone's cup of tea,but I think if you're an open-minded film viewer, who enjoys watching films that are a little quirky and unconventional,you may like it. I've watched this film many times and still enjoy it as much as I did the first time I watched it. I look forward to Versus 2.",positive
"I am not that deep into films from the Pacific Rim, but I have been known to keep an eye out at my local video store for some of the more unusual and outré films. That's how I saw ""Testsuo"" and ""Stalker"", and ""Fist Of Legend"", none of which ever made it this far inland. This one caught my eye with its bold and iconic poster design and the rave review excerpts while I was doing such a sweep, and I decided to give it a try.I have to hand it to our Tokyo counterparts: when they go for frenetic physical humor and quirky characters and over-the-top action, they don't hold back. While many of the story elements, structure, and acting conventions might confuse or jar the sensibilities of the typical American Multiplex attendee, ""Versus"" will win you over if you give it a chance.As I implied, you probably won't find this kind of story told in a Hollywood style production, not even in the action or horror genres: Yakuza gangsters confront supernatural forces (including zombies) in a primordial forest, while an escapee from a futuristic prison slowly tries comes to terms with his 'real' reincarnated identity and powers before an ancient entity destroys him and the world. And anyone in Hollywood who tried to tell a story like this would leave out the most important element: they couldn't possibly make it as 'cool' as the director does it here. (Well, maybe the Wachowski brothers, or the Coens).That's what drives this story and makes it stand out: every scene, every frame, every costume and firearm and major prop in this movie, absolutely oozes atmosphere, fatalistic attitude and macho 'cool', in the same way that video-games like 'Metal Gear Solid', 'Devil May Cry' and 'Splinter Cell' leave you itching to get your hands on a real stealth suit or a katana. The main 'villain' is even better than the movie's protagonist in this regard - he might rip your spine from your back if he needed to (and you couldn't stop him), and he'd smile while he was doing it, but not in a sadistic way...more in a 'what fools these mortals be' way. On 2nd thought, MAYBE a bit sadistic, but also wry and self-amused. I am not familiar enough with Japanese acting standards to be certain, but it seems to me that every actor here is giving what the director wanted from them - the characters they play are all cyphers and stereotypes, but these actors are a hell of a lot of fun to watch. The blocking, the stunts, the 'stage business', the gun battles, the sword fights are all lively and visceral. Again, not subtle, but plenty cool.I was very glad I got to see ""Versus"", and while I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who can't think outside the mainstream Hollywood 'box', I think devotees of the quirky and unusual will find much to enjoy.",positive
"It took me three sessions to finish this movie because it kept putting me to sleep. The word that seems to best fit this movie is ""droning."" The action is most unimpressive, the gore is not half as plentiful as I was lead to believe, and none of the performers make much of an impression. Somehow, despite all the zombie-shooting, it all feels flat somehow, and the expository scenes move at the molasses pace typical of Japanese films. And there is actually a lot of exposition; this film is hardly the nonstop whirlwind of blood and bullets that people make it out to be.  I'm not one of those who complained that ""Black Hawk Down was all action and had no characterization!"" I'm not somebody who insists that every movie needs an original story and a deep message. But if a movie is going to consist of nothing but crazy, violent action, it had better be more interesting than this, which doesn't really have a single pulse-quickening moment in it. I tried to watch this movie again with friends, but they gave up on it in less than 15 minutes.",negative
"Rather bizarre film which I didn't really understand until the gone the midway point to be honest. The plot is odd and not entirely explained as you are spoon fed bits of it very slowly.Its a blend of horror, comedy, sci-fi and fantasy really, almost has an 'Evil Dead' quality to it really, that kind of dark humour with over the top extreme characters. Mix that with a kind of 'Mortal Kombat' style plot about opening portals to other worlds which lie within the Forest of Resurrection but only with the blood of a certain woman etc...a bit clichéd but fun.The whole thing is highly stylised like all Japanese action films...its slicker than a frogs bathing suit. The main hero has dark longish hair and a full length black leather trench coat with black leather pants, dare I say looking a bit 'Crow-esque' there. There's plenty of martial arts, sword play, clever editing along with unique camera angles. Personally I think there has been an element of 'The Matrix' borrowed for this film, well that and quite a few other films, originality is not high on the agenda.Its well known as a cult but I wasn't overly stunned by it, its cool but nothing special really, a bit too clichéd for me. This type of thing popped up a lot after that Keanu Reeves film came out, everybody suddenly realised long black trench coats were uber cool, gets a bit tiresome watching it.5/10",negative
"Ryuhei Kitamura is a young Japanese film maker (born 1969) who made this hyper fast, over the top zombie action horror martial arts spectacle named Versus in 2000. The film takes place in a forest for all the time, I don't think any of the actors are too big stars, and the behind the scenes footage on the film's DVD shows they had a lot of fun on the set (which is easy to believe after the film), so Versus is perhaps the greatest example of not-too-big budget B level horror cinema with more talent and inventiveness than in most mainstream big buck productions.Two criminals find themselves on a mysterious forest. They meet a bunch of heavily armed (of course) Yakuza criminals who have some girl as a hostage. No one seems to know no one and soon the most suspicious ones start get nervous and fire the guns causing the sudden death of one of the Yakuzas. Things get tenser but nothing had prepared them for the amazement when they see their friend soon after his death standing up on the ground, spewing blood from his mouth and attacking towards the living like a flesh eater. I don't know is it a flesh eater as this is a Japanese zombie film, but at least it is a zombie, and soon the forest is full of them. At this point, the Yakuza remember they have buried many of their unfortunate former victims on that forest so now it is time for the criminals to pay for their sins as the corpses get back to life. The ride of 120 minutes of ultra-over-the-top carnage has begun and what follows is something that would make Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and any Hong Kong director see wet dreams.The film is easy to categorize as ""cool"" as everything in it tries to be as cool as possible. The ""hero"" is a handsome young male wearing black leather and naturally he protects the Yakuza kidnapped girl. There are plenty of humorous elements and over acting which is a negative point in my book. I would prefer serious cinema even in a genre like this. Now it all just looks so light and just entertaining without any ambition. But fortunately the short scenes of ""slapstick"" and humor don't come too often and the film concentrates mostly on the furious horror action.The film has some wonderful editing and cinematography and they used panorama lenses for most of the time, creating a very, let's say, quirky, creepy and hysterical atmosphere for the film. The forest is very beautiful (and occasionally reminds me of the forest seen in Kazuyoshi Kumakiri's harrowing 1997 masterpiece Kichiku dai Enkai as well as Shinya Tsukamoto's great 1999 surreal masterpiece Gemini and its riverside scenes), and everything on screen just underlines that they could be in complete peace all the time, shoot their film and have quite a relaxed atmosphere among the crew, which is of course a great thing.The action is fast and furious with many great camera drives, angles (the camera is twisted or moving for most of the time) and usage of wires to make the imagery even more hysterical and breathtaking. The martial arts is also pretty good and the wires are never visible or irritating, as they just fit in a cartoonish and fast film like Versus. Some of the angles utilize also the huge bullet wounds the zombies (and humans) get in a way that the Italian Antonio Margheriti and his 1980 cannibal exploitationer Apocalipse Domani aka Cannibal Apocalypse would turn to green in comparison (and accidentally, that similar scene in Margheriti's film was the ONLY ONE that was shown in one of the film's Japanese teasers on early eighties!).The film is also ultra violent exercise in cinematic carnage as zombies as well as humans get blasted, ripped, shot to shreds, hit to death and the like at the speed that even the mentioned makers of similar horror comedies Evil Dead (1982) and Braindead (1992) would probably applause. The gore is so cartoonish and over-the-top splattery it cannot be taken seriously as not in those other films either. When a guy smashes his fist through a zombie's skull in juicy (literally) close up and tears its eyes off with his fingers, I don't think anyone can feel upset by that, which was definitely not the intention either. The effects are very good and if the budget was low, it definitely doesn't show in the effects and the color red that dominates the screen.The film has also a quite unnecessary historical subplot that only confuses things and makes the film run for slightly too long. The beginning in the history, however, is among the greatest beginnings I've ever seen (really!) as it grabs anyone's attention with awesome soundtrack, menacing sentences appearing on screen and the zombies getting closer to some mysterious character in some mysterious place. This really nailed me in the seat, not the least because of the sonic elements, and similarly effective beginning I can imagine can be found in a dark Hong Kong / Korean co-production action thriller Beyond Hypothermia (Johnnie To, 1996) which also filled its first frames with images that didn't leave my eyes and mind alone. Otherwise, the soundtrack in Versus is not anything special and also manages to irritate with its repeated ""groovy"" electric guitars and techno sounds as they all are as unnecessary for me as the above mentioned scenes of stupid humor and (not creative) silliness, and for the same reasons.Versus is a great film of its genre, having only few problems mentioned above, and it is indeed on the same level with Raimi's Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 (1987), Jackson's Braindead, Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator (1985, USA), Dan O' Bannon's Return of the Living Dead (1985, USA) among the other witty and funny horror comedies dealing with zombies, still these films never forgetting the atmospheric and real horror elements to deliver. And since Versus comes from one of the greatest cinema lands on Earth, Japan, I can't give it less than a bow, a cup of the best sake and 7/10.",positive
"To begin with please don't take this film as serious, as you will be let down. It is in fact a very fun film, which you should really just hop on for the ride as it has some great moments that made me laugh out loud. I'm a big fan of eastern movies, and feel that it stands out on its own due to the combination of styles going on, from the zombie attacks to the samuri / yazuka influence. It travels along at a great pace, the only bad thing about this is the sour taste left in the poor ending, but take that away and its great, and i would say to anyone that they should give it a go, but please watch it with a smile on your face. The sound track is also very good and if anyone knows if it has been released i would love to find out.",positive
"Deep in The Forest of Resurrection lies a dark and sinister secret. It is the 444th portal that connects the world of the living to the world of the dead. Vengeful zombies, returning Sprits of the underworld plus your typical bad guy's are the order of the day here, in this extremely entertaining and intelligent battle of wit and survival. With stunning choreography that brings a new dimension to the meaning of ""fight scene"", explosive and positively dynamic in every sense.This classic cult movie from Japan is fast paced, as is its editing and highly imaginative camera work, with this right combination of vision and dexterity Versus is not your ordinary action cum zombie cum ghost story. This transcends new grounds and highlights both the skill and foresight that we have come to see from the Asian market, while this genre and its undertakings may not be initially new we do see an originality that rightly so deserves merit and recognition.Set in the present where a group of ruthless gangsters, an unknown woman and an escaped convict have met, unwittingly, in The Forest of Resurrection. Their troubles start when those once killed and buried in the forest come back from the dead, with the assistance of the evil Sprit that has also come back, come back from ages past, to claim his prize. The final standoff between Light and Dark has never been so cunning, so brutal and so deadly. This is where old Japanese Samurai mysticism meets the new world of the gangster and the gun. Gruesome, bloody and positively bold.Syuichi Kakeshu (b. 1957) editing is sharp and fast, with its constant no holds barred violence and blood from the very beginning to the very end, only the correct manor of delivery such as Syuichi Kakeshu's work can bring this bloodbath to its climax. Syuichi Kakeshu's other works can also include Alive (2002), Azumi (2003) and Sky High (2003).The special make up effect's by Susumu Nakatani is outstanding and an all out gross affair and accompanied by a descent soundtrack of both synthesizer and rock guitar styles, this is both an exciting and intriguing style of dark humour and violent action. Delivering a feast of gore, countless body part, and with Yûji Shimomura as action director the stunts and fight sequences delivers Versus a mighty punch in return.",positive
"This film screams ""independant."" It's not so much the low budget, or the terrible dialogue, or the awful translation, or the complete lack of direction. It's the stress on western cinema. Every. Single. Fight. Starts with a standoff between two people. A guy could be pointing a gun to another fighter's head, the fighter would then bring his gun up and the man with the gun ALREADY READY TO FIRE would do nothing. There's even a stand off between a sword and an assault rifle. One-sided? Very. Retarded? Exactly.The director tried, but the over-acting was just too terrible. Wonderful gore effects, A+ for those especially with such a limited budget. But it can't help a guy acting like a zombie acting like a spider complete with creepy crawler sound effects. The comedy relief is annoying, the characters are annoying, and if I hear: ""What are you talking about"" one more time I'm going to scream.Overall: Annoying, I don't get why everyone likes it. Last time I checked fight scenes were only as good as the glue of plot that held them together.",negative
"Version: Eastern Eye's R4 DVDHaving seen 'Wild Zero', 'Battlefield Baseball', and now 'Versus', I must say that the Japanese zombies I seem to be watching are... different. Awesomely different. I am not saying other zombie movies are not awesome. They are quiet awesome, but none have them have rock bands with guitar-swords ('Wild Zero'), or are practically 'Highlander' with a few added zombies.The movie opens with a little text narrative - and the only thing that resembles a plot for most of the movie - telling us that there are 666 gates to hell on Earth, one being located in the Forest of Resurrection in Japan. Enter some Yakuza, two prisoners (the Yakuza engineered their escape, for no apparent reason of course), and a kidnapped girl (also kidnapped for no apparent reason). Soon enough, Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) and the un-named lead female character are on the run from Yakuza and zombies, and any semblance of a plot is forgotten until the end of the movie. Awesome.Now that I think about it, none of the characters were even named. If I needed any more proof that 'Versus' did not have any writers to begin with, it would the lack of any names. Speaking of having no writers, 'Versus' has some of the greatest dialog never written, from the good guy proudly declaring ""I'm a feminist"", to his conversation with the lead female where neither can remember anything that happened - or even anything about themselves - before the events of the movie because they ""forget things easily"". Most excellent. Who ever said a movie actually needed a script, or even a simple plot, to be awesome? 'Versus' seems to borrow from a variety of awesome sources. In fact, the movie is practically an amalgamation of: Evil Dead 2, Highlander, old samurai movies (replacing the samurai with zombies), various Arnie movies (think Predator, Commando, and Terminator), the Matrix, and nearly every John Woo movie ever made. Ryuhei Kitamura must be some genius of the most awesome order.Obviously, when there is no plot, or dialog, or character development (I mean really, not naming ANY of the characters is quite an achievement by my book), there must be lots of action and gore. There is plenty of 'Evil Dead' and 'Lone Wolf and Cub' style violence and gore, with people getting split into two or more pieces and running around with giant holes in their bodies. Much like in any good John Woo movie, an endless stream bullets fly in all directions while every character (zombies included) packs enough heat to take out a small army. The kung-fu fights aren't too bad either, and we have the obligatory 'Matrix' jokes. A simple 'awesome' can't possibly describe how awesome I found 'Versus'.If I could one fault with 'Versus', is that it was a tad too long for its style. It could have easily been shorter, but then again, it could have easily less cool.Interestingly enough, Tak Sakaguchi starred in this and 'Battlefield Baseball', with Ryuhei Kitamura directing both, along with the awesome 'Azumi', and 'Godzilla: Final Wars' (which I have not seen yet). Kitamura must be awesome like Sam Raimi.'Versus' is great fun. Not to be taken seriously at all - watch it for a laugh or with some mates, especially if you enjoyed 'Wild Zero' or 'Battlefield Baseball'. I noticed one review here said that one needed to have ADD to enjoy 'Versus': well, give me another copy and call me Captain ADD. After seeing 'Versus', I'm really keen to check out 'Stacy' and 'Happiness of the Katakuris', but for the moment 'Wild Zero' reigns supreme. 'Versus' is still most excellent though - 8/10",positive
"This is a cool movie.The basic story twines around a young lady with the power to grant immortality, and the two warriors who have battled through many lives trying to achieve this from her.In their present incarnation, one warrior leads a group of very amusing thugs, the other the quiet ""lone wolf"" type.Their battle takes place at portal 444 a magical place on earth, were the dead rise again, as zombies.This is a funny over the top violent movie. It is dark too, and not for kids really. It has good action sequences and I think intentional funny bad guys and a couple of hilarious cops in it.Everything about this film is over the top and the death count really gets up there. Lots of fake blood a bit of real looking blood and almost non stop action makes this a great 118 minutes of well-wasted time in my books.",positive
"Looking at the cover of the movie you would expect a Matrix style movie, but you are going to watch something REEEEALY different than The Matrix. As i said in the summary, Versus is a Excellent mix of gore and action, accompained by martial arts, gunplay and swords. The movie begins with a poor zombie getting sliced by a samurai, the samurai kills other zombies and the samurai gets killed by a mysterious character. After this prologue, you see 2 guys that just escaped from a holiday in prison. They meet some gangsters (or Yakuza, since this movie is Japanese), the gangsters are going to help our heroes escape from the police, but something goes wrong. We discover that the yakuza guys kidnapped a girl, apparently the main guy (anyway, no character in this movie is called by it's name, check the cast i am not joking) is not a big fan of violence against womens, and ""accidentally"" one of the yakuza guys gets killed and he becomes a zombie (also, the guy who we see after the prologue that is escaping with the main character gets killed) ! The main character escapes with the girl, but the yakuza boss wants to starts a manhunt, but zombies will go in the middle of the action. LET THE BLOODBATH BEGIN !!!! Anyway, i really enjoyed Versus, a lot of people considered it ""boring"" or ""slow paced"", also there is a final revelation (calm down, i am not going to spoil it). i like Ryûhei Kitamura, i think that he is a good director and the performance of Tak Sakaguchi was awesome, cold and cool, even the rest of the cast did an awesome job.",positive
"I have to tell you, the user comments are far more entertaining than this movie itself!Plus: Just because it's a foreign movie, it doesn't automatically qualify for 7 points, what are you people thinking!Oh, and the best Japanese movie ever? Don't ever tell a Japanese person that, or you'd be barred for ever from entering that country.
There are great Japanese movies, but this one definitely does not belong. While Night of the living Dead, and Day of the Dead have achieved cult status, this movie does not (it's at best an attempt to copy, with a worse plot, worse actors, worse special effects, and worse make-up).Well maybe I should continue watching the movie (it's running right now, but couldn't keep my attention). After so many good Japanese movies, I've been caught a little off guard. If they only had spend a little more on special effects, it would have rivalled the old Godzilla movies (now these are some real funny movies)!!",negative
"Those crazy Chinese, they sure know how to make crazy films. I had a friend once who went to China- he said they didn't have cars but used dragons to drive about instead. Crazy! Especially as dragons are extinct. Versus isn't really a real film, it's really based on an assortment of fight em ups for the computer. Games such as Mortil Come Back World, Road Fighter 2: Championship Edition, and Streets Of Age. The crazy twist comes via the fact that we have not only humans fighting each other, but other creatures too- con men, vampires, weredogs, werecats, zomboids, Bagginses, people of the Aisle Of Man, Santa etc. The basic plot sees a Chinese mafia man re-stealing his girlfriend from a rival mafia man who had re-re-stolen her from the man who his re-stealing her from him. The baddie sends his most trusted warriors after the goodies in a progression of difficulty, starting with a brown belt unarmed amateur, working up through expert bearded swordsmen, giants, and Miyagi, all the way to entire platoons of tanks armed with nukes. Our hero is a decent fighter, but he can only take so much and is ripped to ribbons. Luckily though he is killed in an ancient Indian burial ground on a full moon and comes back as a zomboid. He then has to fight his way out of the Underworld against Medusa, Hitler, and Samuel Peyps only to try to re-re-re-rescue his girlfriend (who has been cheating on him with an Eskimo). Not a lot of the film made sense, especially the parts that weren't in English, and most of the effects and acting left much to be desired. I suppose I can't complain given that the film was made for 10 Yen, but when you see that Parannoying Actively was only made for 80 dollars there really is not excuse.Best Scene: When one of the bad guys is being kicked into the air you can see the string and pulley system being operated by a man in the trees in the background. If you freeze frame that part and zoom in you can see that it is none other than 1980s cast off Rick Moranis.",positive
"Many good comments and reviews have been written about Versus on this web but also on other Asian sites so i decided to take a look with high expectations since it was named as MUST SEE in some websites.after only seeing 10 minutes of the film, you can realize that this movie is just bad and it can't get any worse. I will not comment on the plot because it was weak but yet weak plots are not necessarily not entertaining. Lets get started: The actors were really pretentious and none of them fit the characters they were playing. The bad guys tried to be really bad, which messed up their part but the protagonist was awful, he was trying to be cool as i don't know what Rambo? The tone he spoke with was intended to add to his cult but resulted in sissy kinda hero. The Bad guys were screaming and yet calm all the time which was kinda weird. The way they killed zombie's was probably.... Also worth mentioning, lousy acting, normal people would have acted better than those (not only, would have fit the role better as well)...I usually don't write this much about a movie but this one. I mean the director was immature as well, the movie was shot in bad way which made even more boring than it already was. Colours were not thought of at all.Cliché - the hero's black leather jacket and all that crap, where did that come from? Well if i missed something out I'm sure someone will put it in their comments although most people wrote positive about this movie.",negative
"I saw this film recently, been on my radar for 20 years.
I have enjoyed Ryuhei Kitamura's Midnight Meat Train, No One Lives, Downrange n the segment from Nightmare Cinema but this one is a bit letdown with the same stuff again n again.
The matrix style, gravity defying action scenes became an endurance test.
In fact, I completed the film in installments inspite of fast forwarding some scenes.
Generous with 5 cos of the director's other films.",negative
"""Versus"" is a real low budget zombie/samurai/yakuza film (is this a new genre??) that hearkens back to Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"", with creepy grinning zombies and arterial blood pumped out with abandon.I thought the movie started off really interestingly, then lagged in the middle half with the ""Prisoner"" running around the forest with the girl, slashing at zombies and avoiding the pursuing yakuza gang.But it does get interesting.. and weird. Very weird.Kitamura brings us a weird little runt of a guy running about with a huge machine gun screaming in fright, a one-handed policeman, the apathic hero ""the Prisoner"", a creepy tongue-flicking zombie that makes click-clacking noises as it creepily shimmies up trees, a cool assassin type chick, etc etc. There are some really hilarious moments like when one of the yakuzas yells ""You can't kill me because I have reflexes 500 times faster than Mike Tyson"".. WTF?!?! If you like samurai flicks, if you liked Evil Dead or Land of the Dead etc, if you like campy horror and gore, then you will probably like ""Versus"".",positive
"Title: Versus (2001) Director: Ryuhei Kitamura Cast: Tak Sakagushi, Hoshimi Asai, Toshiro kamiaka, Takehiro Takayama Tagline: Witness a battle no one has ever seen Review: Wild action, zombies shooting guns and doing martial arts, tons of gore, mid-air sword fights, and the Yakuza are just some of the things that make up this amalgamation of genres that can sometimes get a little confusing but is ultimate a fun (and funny!) ride.The story revolves around prisoner KSC2-303. A prisoner who's just escaped and is one of the key elements to opening a portal to another dimension and ultimately giving supreme power to some evil dude who wants it.The main problem with this flick was trying to keep track of what it was all about. You see for some reason the film doesn't explain itself to well in the first half and you are left wondering why is everyone fighting and kicking each others butts. Its kind of hard to care for the characters or what is happening on the screen if we cant quite grasp what its about. I don't know if its the way that Asian cinemas style of storytelling or the fact that this film was foreign but I was having a hard time grasping it. But then again I've seen many foreign films that make perfect sense, like Audition and The Eye for example, so Ill just chalk it up to bad story telling.The other thing is that the film gets a bit confusing because it has so many genres mixed into one another. Is this a zombie film? A martial arts flick? Is this a highlander remake? Is this a mafia movie? Is it an x-files episode? Is it a horror movie? Anyhows once you do figure out what they are all fighting for there's a lot of amusing things to keep you interested. There's the unintended humor which is just great. I mean in what other movie will you see a character cock his gun with his teeth while holding a sword on his other hand? Ha! The dialog is also quite laughable, maybe its because it was dubbed but, heck I was watching the subtitles and the dialog seemed equally loopy.Then there's the crazy characters and situations that are presented which are insanely entertaining. Like for example: anyone who dies is instantaneously brought back to life because they are all standing right smack in the middle of the ""forest of resurrection""! One of the 666 portals to the ""other side""! Crazy huh? Crazy and entertaining if not taken seriously.There's the huge amount of gore thats all over the place, hands, heads, and chests all get chopped in half and blown to bits by a hundreds of bullets and many sword and knife fights. The flick is a non stop hack and slash shoot em up. Non stop action, so for those of you action and gore fans this movie is certainly for you. For those of you who are looking for a smart film...well leave your brains at your doorstep if you rent this one.The American influences in this flick are all over the place, there's references and familiar characters to American flicks like The Matrix, Highlander, The Terminator and even The X-files. The story is about a pair of immortals battling with swords...hmm. Where have I seen that before? Then there's these two private investigators...hmmm..hints of molder and scully? Anyhows, it wasn't something that bothered me, just something I noticed.The flick has a lot of cool shots, with characters having spectacular sword fights (specially the one at the end) and has some interesting camera angles. But many times it feels like its the work of an amateur. The film has too many scenes that just takes the whole seriousness out of it. First your like all dead serious and then wham! Some really stupid situation occurs and just messes everything up. The film was also shot almost entirely in the woods which just screams ""low budget!"" and sadly the film also suffers from some bad lighting.One things for sure the director sure took a lot of time in making his main character pose in lots of ""cool"" looking positions with his swords and guns...as if saying ""check this guy out! Doesn't he look cool?"" In many instances the film will feel like you are watching a live action anime or a comic book come to life. For the comic geek or anime fan this will be entertaining but for the regular schmo looking to see a serious martial arts flick. Don't look this way, because Versus is just a fun, funny and disjointed little flick. It almost feels like this director will someday make a great film, but this just ain't it. There's still room to grow for Kitamura as a director, but hey that doesn't stop Versus from being an entertaining flick. Check it out without any big expectations and you should have a good time.Rating: 3 out of 5.",negative
"I watched the DVD version twice and feel that I should receive a medal for my patience and endurance. Patience is necessary while you wait for the plot to unfold and endurance is required because the sword-fights are overlong.The editing of the fighting is well done because you see short flashes of action welded together to give an impression of hectic action. Blood-spattered faces and the clash of steel blades add to the feverish atmosphere. The influence of kabuki is felt as the actors interrupt the action with a threatening pose.I get the strong impression that this bunch of handsome young Japanese actors thoroughly enjoyed showing off their athletic skills in the so-called Forest of Resurrection. Sword fighting is a dangerous game and it is a wonder that more of the actors were not injured.The Japanese story writers seem to like adding a touch of the ancient myths and legends. I did not know that there are 666 Portals to hell and that the 444th portal is in Japan. One can always learn something from watching foreign films.There is an over-emphasis of blood in this blood-and-guts film. Sometimes realism can be taken too far. This is certainly not a film for the squeamish. Close-ups of arteries spurting blood, entrails falling out of lower bowel like a string of sausages, or a blood-drenched hole in the abdomen, looking like a Henry Moore sculpture. What joy for the cameraman who can actually do long shots through the gaping hole. Add to this a threatening look from a swordsman who licks the blood from the blade of his sword. Black humour indeed!The open-ended script seems to indicate that a sequel will be added. Let us hope that more attention will be given to a more interesting story line in the follow-up. I lost count on the characters who were killed and how many were resurrected, but I do know the character of Tak Sakamuchi will star in the next episode. He seems to be the lucky one who gets the girl for his sterling efforts. If I am offered a medal as an inducement, I just might watch the sequel...but I think not.",negative
"Words cannot describe how cool this film is.  Imagine blending John Woo, Yuen Woo Ping, Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson into one uber-director and you have Ryuhei Kitamura.  Great cinematography, great editing, great sound, cool and quirky storyline, suitably over-the-top acting, gross effects...just absolutely fantastic.Watch it sober and it's great.  Watch it drunk and it's a revelation.",positive
"I've heard about Versus for quite a while, but only tonight was able to see it.  What an awesome flick!  Sure, the action borrows from every HK gun ballet or kung-fu opera ever made, but who cares?  The mix of stylish action and Romero-style gore works quite well, and the knowledge that this whole movie was made for peanuts just enhances it.  The hero's your typical badass standard, but characters like ""The Fighter"" and the psycho laughing Yakuza stand out.  The plot isn't even completely irrelevant, especially given the prologue and the awesome ending.  As long as you're able to check your inner film student at the door, Versus is nothing but entertaining.",positive
"Dude, you GOTTA see ""Versus""!Well...actually, you don't.  If two hours of mindless carnage floats your boat, then this Z-grade Japanese action flick is a must for you.  If you prefer quaint little virtues like characterization and a strong storyline, you can take a pass.I wanted to see this because the director is helming Godzilla's ""final"" movie.  Honestly, I don't think this bodes well for the Big Guy's future. Godzilla flicks are cute and fun and usually a bit thoughtful, whereas ""Versus"" plays out like a Tarantino wet dream (forgive my crudeness, but it's true!).  This movie is all about Cool Lookin' Guys who Stare Each Other Down and then Get Into Ridiculous Sword-and-Gun Fights.  The gore is, needlessly to say, ridiculously OTT, to the point where the film is not even remotely scary or gross - just a self-parody, which is my least favorite form of entertainment.  Sorry, but I actually prefer horror/action films that take themselves a bit seriously; this one is floating around in the stratosphere somewhere.All this is not to say that it's a turkey.  The battles really are fun and the choreography is impressive.  There's a great Joker-type character who spends the whole movie mugging and acting like a complete psycho.  It's just that the good elements are balanced out by a dull heroine, a padded running time, and the aforementioned complete lack of substance.This is a great movie...to watch with friends while you slam a couple of beers.  It's great to laugh at, too.  But actually great?  Nah - it's complete rubbish, innit?",negative
"¨Many people seem to think that this is a good film if you don't expect a good plot or anything else but brainless action. I didn't, it still sucked.First of all even in an action film, you need even somewhat interesting characters. The only slightly interesting guy here was the weird dude in the green shirt and that's only because he was silly. Pretty much nothing is told about the characters, so who cares about any of them. That's the worst thing about this movie, it doesn't get interesting at any point.There was way too little violence, considering that some of the main keywords for this in IMDb are ""extreme violence"" and ""extreme gore"". The blood looked like cranberry juice in most of the shots and it doesn't help that this was meant to be campy.Well at least the action was pretty good, but that's not enough to keep your attention for the whole 2 hours. 90 minutes would already have been a bit too much, but 2 hours c'mon! Action was very anime stylish and has the same problems too; there is too much filler. Shooting zombies in a one scene gets boring after five minutes when there's nothing else to it, so just move on please. Don't bother with this, it's a really boring movie. And I didn't even mind about the ridiculous non-existent plot.",negative
"A zombie martial arts film from Japan? Sounds like a great idea. Think again. You could watch this movie in fast forward and get the same out of it, only in half the time, which in this case is a good thing.I can't believe I read some reviews on here that say this is great cinematography. Constant movement does not equal good cinematography. This cheap Evil Dead/Dead Alive wannabe doesn't deserve the rip off camera shots it stole from them. What this movie lacks that these other movies had is character, not to mention a plot.The setting of the movie couldn't have been more boring. This ""forest of resurrection"" looked like Western Pennsylvania in the autumn when all the leaves have turned an ugly brown. Add a few cars and that's it. No interiors. No lighting needed. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of low budget/no budget movies but this is just a downright waste of whatever money they had. They didn't even spend money on halfway decent gore effects.The actors are horrible. I've never seen less intimidating criminals. The martial arts action was less than special to say the least. The Mighty Morphing Power Rangers have better skills.This isn't even a ""so bad, it's good"" type of movie. I've seen plenty of bad movies and this one by far is the most boring. Don't watch it. Take a nap instead, you need the rest.",negative
"Some may forgive this movie for no plot, but it's thin on pretty much everything else as well.The plot? Well, some prisoner with an attitude escapes... in the FOREST OF RESURRECTION. Things that die come back to life here. Sound interesting? Well, it gets worse. Actually, the plot is pretty much your standard horrible anime script. Some hero fights mystical stuff, for some reasons we don't really know.As if the plot wasn't testing your patience, the poorly conceived and performed characters drive it further into the ground. The ""hero"" is more a caricature of a tough guy than the real thing to even take seriously. I can't even take the villain seriously as he seems as if he's bored while trying to recite some contrived lines.Action sequences are pretty dull, as 'action' is construed as a mass of guns being fired or some unimaginative martial arts choreography. The director probably knew this which is why most martial arts scenes were extremely up close- so you can't see how horrible the fights actually are.I watched the unrated director's cut, the unrated probably from the unnecessary overuse of gore. Whether it was to be a joking prop, so much was shown it got old.This movie is awful. Anyone who rates this movie over a 5 probably shouldn't be recommending movies to others. The direction and execution of this movie gives me the impression that this movie would be material for crusty American Japanophiles. Well, here's your movie.",negative
"The Direction the movie took, was obviously a non-serious compilation of gestures. That Over-used Gore to fufill the ""fun factor"" the movie so very intended. I think if you watch it with other people, you'll have whole lot better time enjoying it, like what I read before a ""Party movie""... But if you watch this movie alone at night, it just may be arguably the worst movie you ever saw...I Give this movie a 7/10... The Beginning was retarded, and make you lose all desire to watch the rest of the movie, but the movie get better and better as it goes along and has a pretty neat ending....",negative
"I had heard so many good things from my friends and I've been a fan of the directors more recent work.That being said, I was amazed at how slow paced and boring this movie was. The action was serviceable, but the forest setting made everything incredibly confusing and a headache to look at.The story is pretty much non existent and extremely trivial. It also does the frequent low budget trope of setting everything in one location.Watch Godzilla Final Wars instead, it's a much better film.",negative
"A very poor film. Mediocre action, characters and acting. A film that uses slapstick, gore and stereotypical ""Slick"" bag guys, the composed anti-hero, the poor little innocent girl, a Clouseau type inspector and of course your gullible zombie hordes which march to their deaths in a series of slaughterfests. The film doesn't alter reality it ignores it, from 6 shooter revolvers firing a couple if dozen shots to throwing away your guns for hand to hand combat in the midst of a standoff. Most disappointing was the main characters portrayal as a bad ass but sakaguchis performance was so poor that rather than conveying ""not caring"" he conveyed ""stare straight ahead and don't change that face"" The movie gets one star because the yakuza leader really put some effort into his character. In all this blows, some people say that its a movie that a group can relax with a drink and laugh at and enjoy, however thats something that can be easily done with XXX2. Doesn't take much to entertain a couple of drunks and this film isn't very much. Usually when someone criticises eastern cinema by saying says ""if that film was made in the west people would say it blows"" In these cases I class them then and there as idiots but on this occasion I accept it. This film is just a Japanese cult fad and if it was shot entirely the same with script, plot, level of performance and even the exact same frames, no doubt the public would bomb it. Face it, this blows.",negative
"This movie is Awesome! All the characters are VERY good, I mean by that they all have their speciality and their own distinct attitude. Although all the action take place in only one forest : The forest of resurrection, just wait to see what happen in that forest and you will understand!!The 444th door.Its none stop action where you barely can take you breath back between fight scene. All hand to hand battle are more than excellent, but the blades battle are just unbelievable!!! The music is excellent and fit just right with fights scenes, the cameras movements in battle are also really well done. The Dark style of the movie give a perfect ambiance to the story and by the way, this movie is Really GORY, so sensible hearth should look away for a moment ;)Don't miss it if you seek good Martial Arts choreography and a full dose of action!",positive
"Unlike a lot of film fans, I am severely under-impressed by the state of Asian cinema. Most of the output is either dull ghost stories or stupidly violent thrillers that would be universally lambasted if they come from anywhere else but the current most fashionable part of the world. Versus certainly has the idea behind it to be a very entertaining piece of cinema; but the idea isn't capitalised upon - the film is overlong, very boring and about as cool as inviting your parents to a house party at your friend's house, even in spite of it's best efforts by putting it's leads in leather jackets. The simple fact of the matter is that if this film was made in America, or just about any other nation on Earth; it would have been hailed for what it is - rubbish. But the fact that it has been produced in Japan means that it's almost intellectual to like this movie, and as there's a lot of wannabe intellectuals watching films at the moment; Versus has found itself with an unjustly positive reputation.The messy plot follows the idea that there are 666 portals to hell, the 444th one of which is in Japan. We follow two escaped convicts who run into a bunch of gangsters that have kidnapped a young girl. After some discussion, one of the gangsters ends up being shot and is promptly resurrected by some mysterious evil. After taking him down, our hero's realise that they're caught in the middle of a forest full of zombies. This plot line really could have made for an entertaining movie, but the Japanese have let themselves down by turning the movie into a video game, and when this is mixed with some rubbish dialogue and some very 'I wish I was cool' characters, what we're left with isn't even fit to be laughed at. The film's wafer thin plot doesn't do it any favours either, as it is spread out over a massive two hour running time, and most of it is simply taken up by lots of fighting, which gets really old really fast. At the hour mark, I didn't even think I'd finish it. Versus is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, even Ringu is better.",negative
"Versus was a disappointment. The core of every good movie is a solid story. It does not have to be elaborate or tight but it has to extend further than an idea for a computer game. And Versus doesn't.The movie isn't original, it is overdone (doing MORE of something doesn't make it better), and each scene has very little direction - just flaps around like an unfinished dream.Granted, the editing is decent and the choreography good at times, but nothing we haven't seen before. It's an amateur movie, comprised of action sequences that are loosely tied together by incomprehensible plot decisions. Not unlike most Hong Kong actions movies and a fair number of Hollywood flicks.",negative
"First off, this movie had to be done with a rather small budget cause all the action takes place in these woods.  There are no sets or anything.  That and the sound is off a bit the whole movie, I am guessing they voiced over all the lines.  On the positive side though, they didn't hold back any money on the gore effects cause there are some good gore shots in this one that reminds me of the Italian horror movies of the late 70's early 80's. However, this movie is not really a horror movie...sure there are zombies, but this one is more action and comedy.  The action is rather good, but the highlight for me was when the zombies that were buried there by the criminals were attacking.  After that the action isn't quite as good as nothing really compares to that scene including the final fight, which was okay, but could have been better.  All in all though it was a fun movie that was really enjoyable to watch.  Does have some strange moments though like the two guys looking for the prison escapees.  You wonder what they were even doing in the movie, that is until the one scene where the one guy tries to do Keanu Reeve's move from the Matrix...let's just say it doesn't work very well in the real world especially when you are being shot at with a howitzer.",positive
"Ryuhei Kitamura's hyperactive video-game-brought-to-life Versus has a huge cult following and is absolutely adored by its dedicated fans, so I'll say state straight off the bat that I loathed almost every second of its exhausting 120-minute running-time. The film is chocked full of the kind of hyper-kinetic camera-work doing 360 degree spins around its leather jacket-wearing characters, who frequently pout and brood in an attempt to look cool, that cinema was swamped with in the wake of the huge success of The Matrix (1999), which itself was heavily inspired by Japanese cinema. But Versus has little grip on its muddled mythology, and the result is a gory, tiresome mess.The story informs us that their are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the 'other side', with the 444th portal located in the Forest of Resurrection in Japan. Centuries ago, a lone samurai battles a few shuffling zombies before taking on a powerful priest who, with minimal effort, kills him. In the present day, two escaped convicts arrive at the Forest to wait for a gang of Yakuza who will take them to safety. One of the prisoners, #KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi), becomes immediately suspicious of the Yakuza's intentions when they arrive holding a kidnapped girl (Chieko Misaka). The prisoner kills one of the Yakuza, who immediately comes back to life as a zombie, and flees in the forest, taking the girl with him.There is no doubting that Versus is occasionally a treat for the eyes, with the editing in particular impressing during the numerous fight scenes. But the fights come one after the other, quickly becoming tedious especially since every battle is introduced by the characters posing while the camera swirls around them for what seems like an eternity. It doesn't help that all of the Yakuza are the type of preening morons seen in a thousand other films, strutting around in sunglasses and awful flashy suits and failing to pose any kind of real threat. The protagonist is also difficult to like - a generic bad- ass played unconvincingly by Sakaguchi, who seems to enjoy frequently knocking out the girl he has rescued as he fights the bad guys. It's meant to be darkly humorous, but instead feels simply misogynistic. At 2 hours, it's a headache-inducing struggle to get through, and is recommended only for hardcore fans of cult Japanese cinema.",negative
"Imagine you are sitting down to watch a bloody, entertaining action movie. You have a cool main character who of course has a shadowy past. First, he shoots someone. Then the dead guy turns into a zombie. Then, the zombies have guns. Already, this is the coolest movie ever made. The soundtrack is killer and the cinematography is amazing. Kitamura is an amazing director, which is why he also directs the cinema in Devil May Cry, and also the soon to be made Metal Gear Solid. So to sum up the movie, it is like a horror/action video game made into a movie, with gallons of blood and huge action. This is why people import movies from Japan. The mythology is hard to follow, but just empty your brain and prepare to be entertained.",positive
"Japan has been leading the world in extreme cinema for several years now - think 'Battle Royale' and 'Ichi The Killer'. Now I really dig this mind-blowing stuff that pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, but sometimes I just want to kick back and have some mindless fun. 'Wild Zero' really hit the spot, and now here's another tongue in cheek Japanese zombie movie 'Versus'. I generally hate action movies (and 'Versus' is really an action movie more than a horror movie, despite what you might think before watching it!), and there's very few movies that mix humour and gore that I really enjoy, but 'Versus' does all this and more, and I LOVED it! I didn't enjoy it quite as much as 'Wild Zero' mind you, but then I prefer rock'n'roll to kung fu. 'Versus' does have a plot of sorts, but it's mainly an excuse for dozens of fight sequences and some silly business obviously inspired by early Peter Jackson. Like Jackson's 'Bad Taste' and 'Braindead' this movie was clearly made on a small budget, but the director Ryuhei Kitamura makes the most of it with a non-stop barrage of frenetic zombie martial arts action! If you just want to be entertained and not challenged then 'Versus' is the movie for you! It may not be deep, but it sure is a LOT of fun!",negative
"This is a movie where u have to love action and style. Cause the story was bad but still somewhat interesting near the end. There are no names for the characters because you don't need one in a movie like this.Sure this movie has a crappy story but you know what?!?!?8k USD in 2 years for making Versus is a damn good job. The movie was made to prove Japanese Producers how wrong they were by saying Japanese Action movies will never be as good as Hollywood or HK action movies. Ryuhei Proved that! And that is the SOLE reason why he called the movie VersusVersus surpasses a lot of action movies i have watched but not the super high budget ones like CTHD which i DON't KNOW WHY PEOPLE KEEP on Comparing this too Matrix Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or any of that!THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THE MATRIX. When somebody wears a leather suit it doesn't AUTOMATICALLY MAKE IT A BITE OFF OF Matrix. And all in All JOHN WOO was the one who started that NOT MATRIX!this movie pays homage too Sam Raimi, John Woo, and Terminator.Also this movies Style in Action WAS ORIGINAL and something different and not usual and also somewhat POETIC.And people say HOW did those things get there?!?!Ever watch Hollywood movies?!?! ever remember how in those movies people just randomly find guns and hardly reload?!?! well This movie also does the same but just more often.Also This movie IS NOT A HORROR MOVIENOT suppose to be scaryThis movie is gory and very funny with excellent action scenes.this movie has ZOMBIES/YAKUZAS/GUN SHOOTING/SAMURAIS/KUNG FUAnd to me there is NOTHING that can ever be compared to this film because you REALLY will never see anything like this.If your a person who is not open minded and likes to try new things and Does not mind Low budget effects this is definitely a movie to watch.I bought this movie Blind Sided and will never regret it.8/10 Fun mindless action with never before seen camera angles.",positive
"A creative movie indeed.... with scenes copied from a few others. I feel like watching a combination of ""Matrix, yakuza Reloaded."", ""Ashes of Time with zombies"", ""Mens In Black but without a hand"", ""Highlander unrated"" and ""Arnies and the Return of the Living Dead""..... (sorry if i have missed your credit)Cant they get more original than that? The plot is intriguing at 1st. then it boils down to absolutely stupid. Characters and plots are created for one purpose, to satisfy the one above formula.And the good thing about this movie? There is some good performance from the leading actress of what her name. (well yes I like her) And a good joke about the right handed person. Plus lots and lots of guts, heads :) and blood which I like.By all means, no movie should be typed as ""sit back and enjoy"" movie. unless the maker intended it to be. Versus is definitely a ""sit back and enjoy"" type; or a good jeopardy program to test your movies knowledge; I guarantee you Versus will remind you a lot of movies that you have seen before.  By removing all its flaws, it may as well categorize as a movie. For now I will term it an ""expensively"" made video.",negative
"Let me start by saying that this is the craziest action movie I have ever seen. I don't mean crazy in the sense it has crazy action scenes (it has), or crazy characters (it has..) or a crazy story (it does have...), I mean crazy on the freaking whole, the whole movie is crazy and has a crazy concept, and that is what made it interested and entertaining for me.So basically a group of convicts escapes into a forest to rendezvous with another group of gangstas, the thing goes wrong, there's a double cross, a gunfight... the usual. However, that forest happens to be one of the 666 portals to the other world. I know right? So what does this mean? That the guys who are gonna get killed... aren't really going to die! This gives a whole new meaning to the idea that people die if they are killed.And this brings us to the best shoot-out action and sword fights of zombies versus yakuzas you will ever seen! Well, then there's something about this guy trying to figure out what the hell is going on, rescuing a kidnapped girl, being the chosen one and fighting the forces of evil... at the same time. It's one hell of a complex plot in a plot less movie... What?? This movie is incredibly gory, funny and fast-paced. It IS action-oriented, but it's so much more! It's also a very crazy film if I haven't mentioned it yet and if it's going to do anything to you other than tell you in your face ""it's all about the fun"" is to entertain you for 2 hours or so.If you like some new and crazy ideas for a not-stop hilarious and action ride, watch this movie with the thought that it's going to be very, very special.",negative
"I was at the same screening as cfisanick in Toronto.  I walked out before the crew took their kudos because I only had insults to throw at them.  I only wish I had walked out sooner.Highlander + Evil Dead + Kung Fu, can't miss?This ultra low budget import has but one, single moment when I wasn't able to say, ""hey, they took THAT out of...""Otherwise, this student quality film commits the worst sin of all: it's boring.Casting is pretty good except for the glaring vapid ""princess"" character whose presence sucks the life out of every scene she's in.The real insult to the audience came on TV (and trapped in a cheap airport hotel trying to get back to the US after 9/11/01) I saw the commercial for it which will ensure disappointment to anyone seeing it based upon its description.It really had no place at the film festival.",negative
"Alright the 1st time i watched this movie was over a year ago on a VCD release I downloaded from... I don't remember where.Have you ever started a movie you felt you HAD to finish?  For me thats hardly ever.  Any time I start this movie I want to watch the whole thing. The effects are good, the acting is ok, the directing is good, the plot and story line is actually original.  Thats right folks an original idea in movies!!!I don't want to give anything away, but I'll say this... I paid 50$ for an import Japanese DVD of this movie instead of ordering a HK rip off.  Ask yourself this, ""how many movies have you seen (EVER) that you consider to be worth 50$"".  My guess is maybe 2 if you are a lucky and educated viewer.If you find a copy of this movie rent it, buy it, steal it... whatever. This is not a movie for people who don't like the following films: Night of the Living Dead, Highlander, Matrix.Now imagine a nice mix of the 3 films and you get Versus.  No one I have showed my DVD of this movie to has not liked it.  You can't go wrong with 100%.",positive
"This B flick is not a good movie, although it brings a certain entertainment value and has cult status written all over. The first part of the movie is fun, the second worthless.<Spoilers ahead>In the first part of the movie, an encounter in a forest between prison escapees and yakuzas turn sour. However, as dead start coming back to life, it becomes incredibly fun to watch the characters shoot their way through all this mess. The action sequences are rather well-crafted (really!!) and make up for the total vacuum in the character design section: not one is convincing.In the second part, the main villain shows up, the plot is revealed and a few secondary characters are added although they bring no value to the drama. The main villain has no charisma and does not interact well with the hero, the new secondary characters have nothing to bring to the table and are just plain evidence of a poor script and the action gets less enjoyable for some reason.<end of spoilers>In a nutshell, it is well filmed, the action scenes are rather good but it becomes ridiculous and lame when after the first hour, you cannot yet be drawn to the character and let yourself be carried by the story. It is not because the plot is weak, it is because the movie is poorly conceived.I give it a generous 4 out of 10.",negative
"Very dumb, indeed; it's best to leave your brain behind when watching this movie.  The plot is only a bare-bones excuse to bring samurai, yakuza, zombies, swords, guns, kung fu, and lots of blood together to make one of the more enjoyable action movies I've seen in a while.  Great if you're an action fan, but if you're looking for plot and character development, you're in the wrong place.  The plot only gets in the way of the action in this one.",positive
"It's a mystery to me how this movie scored so high since it has nothing to offer. I see that it's a B-movie, and that it wasn't made to make any point, or to question some philosophical dilemma , but it fails at the action-suspense level too. Acting is amateurish and bad, characters 2 dimensional, story somewhat complicated but anyone can make it complicated, just throw in some twists and turns, that lead to nowhere, and mention other dimensions and you got yourself a complicated story, but does that make it necessarily good? Effects and fighting scenes offer nothing new and spectacular (for some spectacular effects watch 'Legend of Zu'), swords and bullets fly around, limbs and heads fall to the ground, blood is sprayed all over, and that's it. People run through the woods, fight, utter some cheesy lines, than run some more through the woods and so on for the whole duration of the movie. Fine, for someone who likes non-stop action, but there are hundreds of movies like that, so what's all the fuss about this one?",negative
"Now, this is a party movie at its best. You get Yakuza zombies and all sorts of asian movie fighting (gunplay, swordsplay and hand to hand combat) all presented in a very stylish way. Add the best posing since Pulp Fiction and nice fitting music and your time will not be wasted. If you're not afraid to see some blood that is.",positive
"I find it very strange that many of the viewers who watch foreign movies find it very difficult to understand that Japanese movie has its own taste and effects.Don't expect Japan to do Hollywood movies.Versus, is a Japanese film in which contains Japanese culture.In the 70s the Japanese and even still now the Japanese are known for their anime and samurai films.The Chinese are trying too hard to be like Hollywood,Jackie Chan is an example of that.Japanese movies has a far greater impact than Chinese movies do.Ask anyone what was Jet Li's best movie, ""Fist of Legend"" of course.Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection is the movie that Americans ""really"" noticed Bruce Lee.Versus to me was a movie that continues the Japanese legacy of samurai swordplay and martial arts.The continuation of the success of the ninja turtles,ultra man,power rangers,Gobots,etc.I laugh at some of the comments I have read here on this forum are obsured and very narrow minded.",negative
"In the first Matrix, Morpheus says to Neo, ""C'mon, stop trying to hit me and hit me!"" Then, The Matrix went on to spawn an innumerable list of rip-offs and wannabes, including this over-long piece from Japan. All of those things that The Matrix influenced, however, including its own terrible sequels, seemed to have forgotten that line. Mindless action is fun, and has its place. It can also be incredibly frustrating when the sequences are without consequence. Even martial arts movies with terrible story lines at least have set-pieces that actually move the characters towards some objective. For most of the action in this movie, not so much. This is two hours of people in the woods fighting, and the director never seems to really want anyone to die, and even if they do he CERTAINLY wants to make sure he can fit in some more people to join the not-quite carnage.So here's the deal. It may be considered lazy reviewing to try and write a summary for a movie without figuring out what all of the groups involved in the story are, but in this case I pretty much consider it the point of my review that the specifics in this movie do not matter, at all. Some people arrive in a forest. Gangsters, cops, prison escapees, a female hostage, some necromancer semi-vampire eternal dead dude, and zombies. They all fight each other. The point is that this is some recurring, eternal conflict of good and evil, or at least two sides. The main prison escapee dude is the brother of the necromancer dude, and they have had this fight before, but this time around he's ""changed"" so he might be able to win (read: he's going to win). The female hostage is a seer with the blood of Resurrection that operates in the forest, the Forest of Resurrection, to resurrect things. These things are made clear with what Uwe Boll-like writing there is between the majority of the Michael Bay-like action scenes that drags the playlength of this movie to two hours (a full hour forty over its necessary playlength). I compare the writing to Uwe Boll because the same basic points are reiterated again and again and again, as if the audience has no ability to connect one revelation to another. ""Oh this is the Forest of Resurrection, you say? Then this must be the Forest of Resurrection! And if it's the Forest of Resurrection, than those dead guys must be alive! Oh, so THAT'S why those dead guys are alive. Well since those dead guys are alive, we must be in the Forest of Resurrection. What's that, you say? Well it's where we are!"" I compare the action to Michael Bay because it's way too in love with the boomerang cam, and because ninety percent of the movement and editing ultimately comes to the same end result: posturing.Let me put it this way: this movie should have been only forty minutes long, but it could have easily been just fifteen, if any character would actually pull the damn trigger or stab the other person when they actually had a chance. Instead, as soon as any character comes into the position to be eliminated, the person he's fighting against just grins and sneers in pleased victory. It was okay the first, erm, three or four times it happened. By a quarter of the way through the movie, however, there was no longer any excuse. If any of these people actually wanted to win the fight, they would have long beforehand. ""Stop trying to hit me and hit me""--the motivations of all of the characters are shot when they're no longer fighting for any real reason but just 'cause, you know, they're in this forest thing, of Resurrection y'see, and, have to, do ... stuff. Meh. Roll out next action sequence! Oh, and the Resurrection and re-incarnation plot points pretty much guarantee that this whole thing will never, technically, end. Which becomes the point! Oh God, why?! Why watch a two hour long movie about mindless action scenes with no consequence only to have the point of it be that the action scenes are never supposed to end, it's just posturing for ever and ever and ever? Oh. 'Cause the action's neat. And, like, action-y and stuff. Alright.Not an entire waste of time, but you can honestly fast forward through the majority of this movie and miss nothing.--PolarisDiB",negative
"The first thing that drawn me to Versus was the front cover because it was just amazing thing to look at.   The pose the main character makes on the cover can be just summed up in one word (Cool).    And that is exactly what the film is, cool.   I expected something out of the ordinary with Versus but the 45 Minutes are just mad, mad in a good way, but they are just mad. Bullets flying all over the place and more blood shed than a Saddamm Hussein torture chamber.   the whole film was just engrossing.   I did think it became a bit tame towards the end as it started to slow down onr hour into it, but that part of the film was where we got to actually find out what the hell was going on, and it was a pretty clever story I thought, but Japanese films have always been better than any American films, apart from the Westerns of course.   Don't expect a masterpiece, just expect the unexpected and a s**t load of blood.",negative
"I have to be honest with you. I haven't seen the whole movie and I fast forwarded some parts of it. The reason is simple. I just couldn't handle it. Not because of the gore, of the blood, of the ""super-fast-I can't see sh*t"" action scenes, but because it is dull. Plain and simple.Don't get me wrong, I adore Japanese movies, especially horror-action movies ala Miike. But this was too much even for me. Even though this movie was meant to be fast paced it was slow in my eyes. People were just wandering in the forest aimlessly. And I just couldn't see the point. This movie should be half an hour long.OK, I give it to the director, some parts were funny, some were original, but in the whole it was boring. Repetitive. The basic idea overused. There are tons of movies like this. The Japanese like to put everything in a movie making it a mess. Samurai, zombies, severed heads, cut-off limbs, blood, machine guns, gun fights, kung fu, flying, supernatural, etc. In one word: GARBAGE.",negative
"VERSUS opens with a period samurai sequence with clearly supernatural elements that promises a great deal. For no good reason whatsoever, this approach is abruptly abandoned and we're whisked forward in time to the present, where we're introduced to a pair of prison escapees loose in ""the Forest of Resurrection."" This contemporary setting, unfortunately, makes up the bulk of the movie... which is considerable (it logs in at over two hours). The aforementioned samurai setting is reprised near the film's end (and are, in fact, the highlights), but not before a lot of blood has been let. And the bloodletting do go on. And on and on. Were it done with some degree of artistry- or even some semblance of reason-, one could accept it. But the carnage exists for its own sake (as opposed to furthering the story, or to someway entertain the viewer). It grows tedious in its execution. The tacked-on ending (which one can see coming a mile away) doesn't help. The director's LONGINUS, a short that, not unlike the anime BLOOD: THE LAST VAMPIRE, begins in the middle of something (we're never told exactly what, by the way) and features a lot of gun-pointing that's so confusing it's impossible to tell who's on whose side, is likewise as muddy in its storytelling. (LONGINUS is like an extended music video without the music.) If you're a hardcore gore fan, check out VERSUS. If you prefer your flights of fancy tempered with a bit of coherent storytelling or compelling characters, giver a pass.",negative
"Versus was a myriad of many things: action, horror, and comedy.( the character in the double breasted suit with green shirt was a nut) The fighting is the only thing I saw that was really effective.  The zombies were pretty serious at the beginning, but turned into an eventual joke somewhere around the middle.  This movie tried to be so many things, I just eventually lost interest in what I was watching.  And lessen the amount of characters.  It was really unecessary.  The ending, I won't spoil it, was a twist but at that point, god himself couldn't have appeared and I would have been any more enthralled.  The fighting sequences were pretty cool, and I do enjoy my share of Japanese film humor, so there were things in this that were commendable.",negative
"This was one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen! Non-stop action in a frenetic mash of martial arts mania and zombie gore. It's easy on the Eastern mysticism, but heavy on Western weapons, and with effects that will make you cheer. This one is worth the effort to obtain on DVD. Infinitely re-watchable, you'll love every blood-dripping second again & again.",negative

"Hey, where's Sonny Chiba when ya need him because this Kang-Fu sh*t started to get old after the first 45 minutes or so.And I can just see all the Sam Raimi EVIL DEAD slave worshippers out there, clapping their hands over this in glee.  They'll be so arrogant as to tell you that if you didn't like that film, then you are not a true horror fan, and that if you don't like this film, then you are not a true action fan. Well that's all just a load of bullsh*t as far as I'm concerned.See, this one's also too cute for it's own good.  It tried to be funny, violent and horrible all at the same time and fails on all accounts, in my opinion.  And when a film tries to be too many things all at once, it winds up being just a whole lot of nothing.The acting is terrible, the gore looked phony like someone splashed some red paint on people's faces, and the CGI looks like something a first year computer graphics student could do.  ""Wow look at the hole in my stomach. I can see right through..."", I can hear them say...  (yawn...)
Plus it has that slick, speeded-up jiggly camerawork that so trendy and popular these days.  Ya know, the kind that looks so arty and pretentious that it borders on distraction.  It even manages to make the vast forest that the whole film was made in, look claustrophobic.
At least the camerawork it isn't as bad as in Takashi Miike's CITY OF LOST SOULS or in Laurence Malkin's SOUL ASSASSIN, so I didn't go blind by too many flashing lights or anything.Does the firing of as many bullets as possible make for a better movie? Maybe for CGI morons and headbanger idiots who haven't outgrown video games it does, but not for me.Another mediocre offering from today's Japanese cinema.2 out of 10",negative
"I just saw this for the first time earlier today.  It's low budget, 400k, set completely in a forest.  But that doesn't mean there was a shortage of blood packs or severed heads, of course.I found it quite amusing that the main character had the word ""LAWBREAKER"" printed in large letters on his uniform.  Funny.  I also liked how these zombies were actually dangerous.This is one of those movies where they tried for style above all else.  And the director (this was his first major film) had a lot of innovative shots. There are a lot of taunts, standoffs, gun shootouts, sword fights, decapitations, all the good stuff you'd want to see in a really violent movie.  My god, some of the characters are so unbelievably cocky.One bad part: the movie doesn't seem long due to its 116 minute length, but rather because many scenes, whether from dialogue or standoffs, are too long.  When people are actually fighting, the pace is quickened, but in between, the director wasn't trying to quicken the overall pace of the film at all.  Sort of a minor problem, for this movie is still pretty cool.  I'll probably buy this just because it was such a unique experience.",positive
"it wasn't what i expect and i guess that was the problem.  i guess it seemed compelling because of the really serious, and polished-looking cover art.well it's not serious, and it's not polished; it's shot on video.  it's a lot of killing zombies, and i think there might have been characters in there, but i might be wrong.  yes i can be, and am wrong.  it was just zombie-killing.and there's a place for movies like that.  so i'm not complaining i suppose.uh, enjoy.",positive
"This film was awesome one of the best Japanese movies I've seen so far. Two days ago I was looking at some of the new DVD's my brother had got when he was out shopping and I saw he got Versus and he told me it was really good, so I took the DVD and started to watch it and I must say I had no idea what was going on in it until about 15 minutes before the end lol. I sort of like the way you never find out anybody's name in the film, the villain is just the villain and the girl is just the girl and are main man in the movie (Tak Sakaguchi) is just called Prisoner KSC2-303 so no real names at all. I think I liked this movie because its a bit of mix of some of most of my favourite movies, I don't have any dislikes about this apart from some of the acting by the bad guys.",positive
"A friend of mine told me that I just had to see this film if I were into movies directed and written by the master Ryuhei Kitamura. The movie starts out in true Kitamura style and more or less caught my fully attention from the start to the end. The plot is very original (which wouldn't come as a surprise, would it?) and the scenery is just simply amazing (Japanese forests are something different, aren't they?). Tak Sakaguchi makes an excellent performance here together with Hideo Sakaki. This movie makes me somehow think of ""Bad Taste"" by Peter Jackson at times, but I suppose that is how Ryuhei Kitamura likes to mix it when it comes to a movie like this one. I wouldn't claim that this is the best work by Ryuhei Kitamura what I've seen so far, but I'm definitely growing a special liking about his work. 7/10!",positive
"Oh wow, I did not expect to have so much fun watching this movie. Gore, intense action sequences, an amazing amount of eye candy (every one was just plain gorgeous), and dark humor! How could you possibly go wrong?Actually, you can, but just slightly else Versus would have received a higher rating. While I can appreciate the intentional campyness and forgive the lackluster cinematography, not a lot of people can. That, in a nutshell, is Versus' flaw; it is not for everyone.This would, however, be a great ""Guy's Night"" flick. It's pure action all the way through with some semblance of a plot that doesn't really seem that important to begin with. A portal, and a girl...and...stuff...whatever? Who cares!? The Yakuza are a mix of Charlie's Angels and The Three Stooges, the protagonist is an ass-kicking, matrix wannabe with a flair for dramatic trench coat flinging, and there are zombies...with guns! Seriously, don't expect for this to be the next Living Dead, or anything of that sort. Pop it in, find a friend, and be prepared to have a blast as you laugh at the wrong moment and root for your favorite person!",positive
"I feel like vomiting, not only do i have huge headache from the disease that i just watched called Versus, the sad part is that i actually paid money for this. First off, the storyline is beyond gay, i think kids who watch The Power Rangers would laugh if they could stand watching this entire movie. You're ever reminded that this is a pile of crap by the long drawn out scenes in between the fighting... as the cameramen seem to have forgotten to turn it off. The special effects are so poor, you can see firecrackers going off on the sides of the weapons.... it couldn't have been worse if they just said ""Bang Bang! Bang, Bang Bang."" The actors are stoic, insipid at best. I think the worst part is... if they actually had a good storyline, dropped the cheesy gore, they might have made a half decent movie. I am punching myself so hard for not buying more Vampire Hunter D, yes if you like any part of this movie, your warped like brain will have a field day watching Vampire Hunter D... it's everything this movie lacks, but the exact same genre... undead zombies, vampires, swords and weapons. Only... you can appreciate watching it after your done, instead of wanting to kill yourself for wasting two hours. I now understand that, some believe this to be a comedy, in some aspect of never actually making a joke, but only being too incompetent that it must be a joke. I don't really care to say more... if you're looking for a well-made movie, this is not.",negative
"Back in the days of buying VHS tenth generation dubs of movies at comic conventions, getting a copy of Versus was a big score. Written, produced and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura (Godzilla: Final Wars, The Midnight Meat Train, No One Lives), it was a non-stop fistfight zombie massacre, the kind of movie you could put on at a party and no one would complain about the subtitles.Today, twenty years later, there's nerd rage because Arrow dared to tweak the colors on this blu ray release, even though they worked directly with Kitamura and most of them saw a copy that was either many, many versions removed from an original or saw it streaming. As for me, I'm beyond happy to have an incredible looking version of this movie in my collection.Originally intended as a sequel to Kitamura's Down to Hell, instead this became a movie all its own that starts with a story that there are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the other side which are concealed from human beings. Somewhere in Japan, there exists the 444th portal known as The Forest of Resurrection, where we see a samurai battle zombies before being killed by an evil priest and his followers.That brings us to here and now, as two prisoners escape through the forest and meet up with a gang of Yakuzas. Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi*, Battlefield Baseball, Deadball, Why Don't You Play In Hell?) notices that they have a girl - known only as The Girl - kidnapped and decides to kill several of them and escape with her.The yakuza call for The Man (Hideo Sakaki, Battlefield Baseball, Kamen Rider × Super Sentai × Space Sheriff: Super Hero Taisen Z), who berates them for letting them go. They retaliate by killing him and in turn, he rises from the dead - as do a forest full of their victims - because he and Prisoner KSC2-303 are reincarnations of past lives. The Man plans to sacrifice The Girl to open the portal hidden in The Forest of Resurrection and obtain the power of darkness. He kills Prisoner KSC2-303, but The Girl revives him with her blood.While he is coming back to life, he learns he was the ally of the samurai we saw die and that The Man and his gang were the evil priests. The Girl was a princess whose blood was the secret to opening the power of darkness, so Prisoner KSC2-303 sacrificed her to save the world, then was killed by The Man.What follows is the fight to end all fights. Pretty much every action-oriented gunplay film from 2000 on owes something to this movie**, a film so out of control that the two shoot at one another point blank multiple times, their bullets blocking each other every single time.99 years later, despite the Earth being destroyed, they find one another again. The Man is now the hero, Prisoner KSC2-303 has his gang and The Girl is still alive, telling him that she should have been on his side. With nothing left to blow up, Prisoner KSC2-303 demands another battle. The look on The Girl's face says it all, because they will fight forever.Versus at the same time is a wildly original mashup of gunplay, zombies, humor and martial arts while at the same time a homage to The Evil Dead and Highlander. Kitamura says that he was inspired by the films of Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and George Miller.You have to love a director this in love with film, someone getting high off his own supply, who spent the majority of the film's budget on food for his cast and crew. You can spot the references - The Frighteners; Predator; The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; The Harder They Come - just as easily as you can see the movies that refer to it afterward.It's as close to a perfect movie as you can get.Plus, you get a treasure trove of extras, including Nervous and Nervous 2, two mini-movies showing side stories of other characters in Versus, as well as Versus FF Version, a condensed, 20-minute recut of the film.This is why they make blu ray. Physical media - even if you've bought nunerous bootlegs of this film already - forever!*Sakaguchi claims that he met Kitamura during a street fight that he was involved in. Kitamura offered him a role in his film after asking him if he'd rather fight in the streets or fight in his films. Yes, that sounds like something out of Street Fighter, but it's supposedly true.**So do video games. Metal Gear producer-director Hideo Kojima is an extra in this and he picked Kitamura to direct the remake of Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, which is full of Versus influence.",positive
"Deep in the Forest of Resurrection, where the recently deceased return to life as undead zombies, two warriors battle over the fate of a woman with the power to grant eternal life.  Each warrior falls on one side of the line between good and evil.  But the line becomes so blurred it is nearly impossible to tell who is good, and who is evil.  Caught in the middle of this battle are a group of ruthless Yakuza gangsters, crooked policemen and completely innocent victims.Simply put, this film is amazing.  It's much better than I ever expected it to be. I was in awe from the start of the gripping opening sequence to the suprise ending.  The story is completely unique, the direction is some of the best I've ever seen.  It's never dull, which says alot because the entire movie takes place in the same setting.  The action is top-notch. Inventive gun play and the most realistic yet wonderfully choreagraphed fight sequences I've seen in a long time.  Some of the actors (especially the Yakuza) go a little overboard at times. Some of the sound effects (the sword slashes) could've been better.  And the musical score is as often good as it is bad.  But these are only minor complaints.  If you're a fan of the genre or just completely bored with American cinema then buckle up and watch this film.  It has everything.  You couldn't ask for anything more.",positive
"I rented this movie for a ""Bad Movie Night"", as it was my turn to pick the movies, and it seemed like it would be a good, campy, fun ""bad"" movie. Little did I know I was actually getting a bona-fide bad movie. The ""runt"", whom everyone seems to love, was one of the worst characters I have ever had the misfortune to watch on screen, though he was almost outclassed by the ""crazy"" guy. I guess slapstick idiocy is what passes for decent acting these days. Wonderful lines such as: ""unfortunately for you, I'm a feminist!"", along with its dramatic camera work and music, served to wonderfully highlight the overall badness of the film.

It was THAT bad.",negative
"I am amazed about the comments that people love this movie and give it so much praise.The plot is non existent, the acting terrible, the special effects dull - I mean it looks like fireworks coming out the end of the guns when they fire, the sword play heavily staged and the gore is just, well, childish.None of the actors give anything like a decent performance and the guy in the green jacket just acts like he recently escaped from a mental institution ( I cant even be bothered to look back and check who it is, thats the effect this film had on me).The setting of the forest instead of making it claustrophobic, just underlines the poor quality and apparent cost cutting involved right the film.It is to be honest like a film students first attempt at creating a swordplay drama and mysticism.A waste of money and more importantly my time.",negative
"The introduction tells us that there are 666 portals linking our world with the 'Other Side'; the 444th is 'The Forest of Resurrection' in Japan. Opening in tenth century Japan a lone samurai fights off what appears to be a hoard of zombie samurai only to be killed by a priest. Cutting forward to the present day two convicts have escaped from prison and are met by a group of yakuza. Tensions soon rise as one of the prisoners tries to rescue a woman kidnapped by the gangsters. One of the gangsters is shot but rises from the dead! The other prisoner is soon killed leaving the survivor and the woman to flee into the forest pursued by the yakuza. Later 'The Man' arrives; he has plans for the woman and the prisoner to open the gate to the other side.This may not be a great movie but it is a lot of fun. There is lots of action; plenty of gore and a surprising amount of humour. The action and involves martial arts, firearms and swords and is often fairly over-the-top; to such a point that the goriest moments are also the funniest. At one point a zombie is punched so hard in the back of the head that when the hitter withdraws his fist he is holding a pair of eyeballs! The acting might not be the best but the exaggerated performances fit perfectly with the feel of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of action and zombies... it may be silly but it is also surprisingly enjoyable.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",positive
"This movie was the biggest piece of sh*t my eyes will have ever watched. EVER. At first it just appears to be a piece of sh*t zombie movie, but then somehow they managed to turn it into one giant flaming piece of sh*t altogether. Excessive violence can certainly be fun, but this piece of sh*t just gets dragged on and on and on until you want to gouge your own eyes out. This movie had no plot, by the end they weren't even trying to make up excuses for yet another drawn out fight scene. It almost would have been better if there was no dialog, because that was what made this thing an even bigger piece of sh*t. It sounds like it was written by a bunch of sixth grade kids, and the dubbing all sounded like bad Clint Eastwood impressions. If you closed your eyes and just listened to the dialog, you would think it was just one guy talking to himself the whole bloody time. Enjoy!",negative
"A pair of escaped convicts rendezvous with a group of Yakuza next to a supernatural forest which, unbeknownst to them, has the power to revive the dead. When a gun-fight breaks out between the gangsters and the escapees, Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) runs for cover in the woods, accompanied by a young woman who has been kidnapped by the Yakuza; this proves to be a bad decision, since this is where the gangsters have been burying their victims, and now the dead are returning to life!I love hyper-kinetic, ultra-violent, Manga-inspired sword and gun-fight action as much as the next movie geek, but even I realise that it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Director Ryûhei Kitamura, on the other hand, doesn't seem to understand the concept that, sometimes, less is more.His low-budget Yakuza vs Zombie flick Versus delivers non-stop visual mayhem, which sounds like fun (and for a while, it is), but it ultimately results in tedium. Pacing and narrative coherence go completely out of the window in favour of a non-stop barrage of admittedly impressive battles, cool posturing from the crazy characters, and splattery scenes of cartoonish gore, and by the time Kitamura finally begins to tell anything close to resembling a story (some nonsense about a reincarnated Samurai and his eternal battle against an evil being), it's all a bit too late.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",negative
"The main problem I had with this movie was that it was a plotless mess. Basically an ultra gory martial arts/gun battle lasting two hours with a one sentence plot.  By the time I got to the end, I was basically playing ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" with the movie.",negative
"Martial arts and Yakuza and zombies. What a combination. The fact that I watched it after Miyamoto Musashi kanketsuhen: kettô Ganryûjima made it even weirder.Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) escapes from a maximum security prison and is met by the Yakuza, who have a girl (Chieko Misaka) as a hostage. They are waiting for someone else to arrive when everything starts happening. The prisoner and the girl escape to the forest.Now, this is not your ordinary forest, and this is not your ordinary prisoner, and this certainly isn't your ordinary girl.This forest is full of zombies. In fact anyone dying in this forest turns into a zombie. These zombies fight with swords and guns and whatever. You cannot kill them as they will rise again, so it makes for some very long fight scenes. There is an abundance of severed limbs, decapitations, and buckets of blood.The prisoner is ultra-cool and the way he keeps telling the girl to ""shut-up"" and punching her is funny, and a strange way to act for someone who eventually says, ""Don't touch my girl, f*cking asshole."" The f*cking asshole is, of course, the uber villain (Kenji Matsuda).Look for some very funny and bizarre characters in Ryuhei Kitamura's film, and lots of action.",positive
"This is one of THE movies that has to be seen. The influences of The Evil Dead series by Sam Raimi (before he sold out), the great Godfather Of Gore himself Lucio Fulci are felt through out. To all of those people that think that the Matrix is the bomb need to look beyond that horizon and see the new breed of Japanese film making. The in jokes towards the Matrix are funny to boot. The plot is very simple to follow (since one is not really needed) and the visuals are what makes this film kick maximum rear end. I would like to see ole Keanu Reeves take on one of the anti-heroes of this film.I am very certain that a sequel is in the works and I would love to have a replica of the sword that is used at the very end of the picture for home self defense. This movie has everything: Blood, Zombies, blood, gun fights, blood, hand to hand fighting, blood, swordplay, blood, comedy, and even some hints of vampirism. Oh yeah. Did I mention blood!? If not the ""crimson spray"" (blood) is enforced at quite a maximum level. This is what Resident Evil could have tried to be like!!!!",negative
"So my girlfriend gets this movie the other day and says that she's been waiting so long to see it. Like an idiot, I offer to watch it with her tonight. I am just sitting here speechless. I think I would've rather spent the last two hours having my left nut smashed with a hammer. At first, I tried to fall asleep but hearing that awful dialog keep jarring me awake. It was so bad I couldn't even fall asleep. Rotten rotten rotten. Worst movie I have EVER seen! Go ahead and watch it, if you're retarded! Love you honey. You're not retarded, however, if you watch it again I won't be so sure. I am now gonna go puke. There was not one shred of talent with ANY of the actors. Could the plot be any more elementary? My god, this was filmed by eighth graders on acid, wasn't it? Worthless, just worthless.",negative
"Being a long-term fan of ""The Evil Dead"" I became aware of ""Versus"" around the time of it's release, as it wears its love for Sam Raimi on its sleeve. I've infrequently watched the DVD over these past twenty years and when it came to watching it again yesterday, I could remember almost nothing about it. Though it took a bit of time to warm to it, eventually it won me over.In the prophetically named Forest of Resurrection, a pair of prisoners on the run meet up with a group of Yakuza, who have arranged to facilitate their escape. Tensions between the groups rise, as they wait for their boss to arrive, eventually boiling over when a kidnapped girl (Chieko Misaka) is brought out from the car. Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) kills one of the gangsters and rescues the girl, but before they can escape, the dead gangster stands up and attacks his former associates. Under certain circumstances, the dead can become reanimated here in the Forest, which is bad news for the Criminals, as they've been burying their victims here for years.Let's be clear, ""Versus"" is exactly what it aims to be. The violent physical effects from early Raimi or Peter Jackson, mixed with the Katana fights and gunplay of the Japanese studios. The acting is over the top, the camera is constantly moving, and the rules of the film's narrative are confused at best. It took me a while to get back into it as it's markedly slower in the first 30 minutes than it becomes later on. I would describe it as being style over substance, but really the style is the substance. Black leather trenchcoats, perfect hair, constantly pausing the fights to pose for each other. The later fight scenes are pretty good though, and some of the real physical gore is quite impressive.I suspect I can probably leave it for another decade now, but if you're in the market for a film like there, there are dozens of examples of films that aren't half as accomplished.",positive
"The idiocy of popular opinion never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think the general public's taste in film couldn't get any worse, I see Ryuhei Kitamura repeatedly thrown under the bus. It's no understatement to say that the sheer abuse this guy takes is both unreasonable and unwarranted. It's become perfectly obvious that most viewers are simply too pompous, stuck up, or clueless to enjoy Kitamura's better films.""Versus"" is a prototypical example of getting the most out of a shoestring budget, a success that is perhaps eclipsed only by Shinya Tsukamoto's ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" (1989). Take any popular commercial director, chuck them in a forest with a camera and a bunch of no-name actors and see what happens. In almost every instance you'd get an absolute disaster. Most directors lack the ability to make something out of nothing. The mere fact that ""Versus"" kicks a$$ is enough, in and of itself, to solidify Kitamura's place as one of the most resourceful filmmakers of modern times.Regardless of budget limitations, this is a highly entertaining movie. Yes, the acting is mediocre and the storyline is simplistic, but Kitamura's camera-work is better than almost any director alive today. The action scenes in ""Versus"" are driven by exceptional camera placement. The riverbed fight and the final sword duel are two cases in point, as the character movements are given a high energy feel through a shifting of camera angles. The physical limitations of the actors are indiscernible because they are effectively portrayed as proficient in combat. Most filmmakers lack the talent to pull this off, but given the fact that Kitamura is a genius behind the camera, it's no surprise that such techniques work very well here. This is not your typical Hollywood style of amateurish hyper-editing, because in ""Versus"" you can actually identify the characters' specific movements.As I've pointed out in my previous review of ""Sky High"" (2003), Kitamura has an uncanny ability of applying ultra stylish camera-work and scoring to trivial events to make them twice as enjoyable. Take the opening confrontation between the yakuza and escaped prisoners. The movement of the camera is exceptional and the soundtrack is catchy, spicing up an otherwise filler scene. I've been lectured on multiple occasions that ""directors shouldn't spin the camera around actors"", but this pretentious rule (probably concocted by some old fart at AFI) is a worthless criticism that artificially limits creativity. Most interestingly, Christopher Nolan used this ""forbidden"" shot during the fundraiser scene in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), but I have yet to see anyone slam him for it. Seems like a case of selective criticism to me. There's simply nothing wrong with using it.As if arbitrary movie-making ""rules"" weren't bad enough, some of the negative comments for ""Versus"" on this site are beyond ridiculous. If ""Versus"" is the worst film you've ever seen, rest assured that you're a victim of your own ignorance. Go watch ""Pistol Opera"" (2001) or ""Kill Devil"" (2004), then come back and apologize.If Kitamura's films are ""too long"" and ""boring"" for you, it's time to take a hard look at your personal rack of dvds, which will most likely expose your own hypocrisy. My blood boils when hearing people blather about Kitamura's dullness, especially considering how many of these same reviewers will kindly sit through Peter Jackson's 3-hour torture sessions with half a dozen superfluous endings tacked on one after the other. Kitamura never comes close to that level of bloated pretentiousness. Sure, the latter half of ""Versus"" acts as a calm before the final storm, and much of the visual/audio techniques are applied to lull the viewer into a state of tranquility (almost like those ""Pure Moods"" cds). This may provoke a bit of drowsiness, but that's a fairly minor qualm to be made. If anything, Kitamura's patience to capture the natural settings is a positive.In terms of mood, ""Versus"" is a very light-hearted and playful film despite the bloody violence that's presented. With quotes like ""I was trained at FBI headquarters in Langley"" and ""I grew up in Yellowstone National Park in Canada"", one should not take this film too seriously. (Though most American viewers are probably too dim-witted to understand why these statements are funny to begin with.) The love interest has some laughable moments too, like when she finally dodges her hubby's knockout shot. Most notably, the sword-wielding gun-toting zombies are beyond hilarious. Make no mistake. This is an over-the-top action/horror movie that never takes itself too seriously.That said, art-house snobs could never appreciate a film such as this regardless of how well it's executed. Hence my use of ""pompous"" and ""stuck up"" as adjectives in my opening paragraph. But what about the remaining detractors who I refer to as ""clueless?"" Well, that would refer to your typical mainstream cinophile who could never enjoy a film with a budget less than a few million dollars. It's depressing when one realizes that most moviegoers are clueless, while much of the remainder are pompous, arrogant, or simply have no taste. That leaves a relatively small piece of the pie to be respected. No wonder then, that Kitamura will never get the acclaim he so rightfully deserves.To not like ""Versus"" may be due to poor taste in film, but at least you can redeem your worth by watching and enjoying ""Sky High"" and ""Azumi"" (2003), which are two of the most enjoyable Japanese films ever made. To dislike those is a sign of lunacy.",positive
"I have to admit, I was nearly bored to tears during my first watch-through of Ryuhei's VERSUS. However, I bought the movie for $20, so I was determined as all hell to enjoy this movie. The fact is I didn't really need all that much determination. This movie is a stamped example of the kind that gets better not only as you watch it, but also the more times you re-watch it.Mr. Kitamura has a talent for a few things, unfortunately pacing probably isn't one of them because the movie phases in and out of speeches that, even though translated, make little sense the first time you see the movie, and action scenes that might confuse someone new to Asian action cinema.But for a movie with such a low budget (estimated to be under 10,000 dollars), it shows potential, creativity and a serious attitude of ""do what you can with what you got"". The action is intense, comedic, fierce, and above all excellently directed. The point of direction is to see what they want you to see and in this there is quite a success.I can only recommend that the first time through- don't try and figure anything about the story out. Just enjoy the action and some of the comedy (most of it is either shock schlock or just very dumb comedy) and then on the second watch through re-read whats on the back of the box and pay attention to what the bad guy has to say. On that note I actually enjoy a majority of the acting. Hideo Sasaki is MENACING, and Takaguchi knows hot to be bad ass.When it comes down to it, Versus is what every amateur director should dream of making (at least if they're going for genre fair) because it just bleeds potential, and potential is what is most commendable of low-budget movies, even if they don't fully succeed at what they do.",positive
"***POSSIBLE SPOILER***Now here's a strange piece of work: a movie about yakuza-zombies. Actually the main plot is about portals and immortal men or something. Anyway it doesn't really mather, the backbone of this flick is all the blood and guts spilled in it. Think japanese ""Bad taste"" with more style but less humor and it's probably something like this that springs up in your mind.The humor in this movie is pretty annoying. Especially with a guy that runs around and screams all the time. The fights are very impressive, considering the low budget. The angles are sometimes inventive but also repeating themselves occasionally. The worst things about this movie is the slow pace wich sometimes make the movie look better than it should but almost always makes it feel boring. But besides that and that the movie is a bit too long I've got to say that I found it to be rather amusing.5/10",negative
"I had the chance to rent the movie VERSUS a few years back. I'd heard it was worth giving a watch and had no idea what to expect. The end result was that I loved the movie. It was one of those off the wall adventures that you had no idea what to expect next. So when I heard that Arrow Video was going to release the movie I was excited all the more.The movie opens in the past with a Japanese swordsman facing off against a wizard and his henchmen. His goal is to prevent this wizard from opening one of the 666 portals to hell and gaining immortality by sacrificing the blood of an innocent. He succeeds and we move forward to the present.Two escaped prisoners one of which is Prisoner KSC3-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) are wandering around a forest near where they escaped. The other prisoner is part of a gang that is supposed to meet them there to pick them up. The gang shows and there is little trust between them and KSC3.Tensions only grow when they bring out a woman they've kidnapped (Chieko Misaka). The leader of this group lets the prisoners know that he intends to kill off their boss and take over the gang. It isn't long before trouble kicks in, people are killed and things begin to get weird. Weird as in the dead begin to rise only to be killed again.This is when the gang begins to wonder about this location and why their boss chose it. KSC2 and the girl are taken to a nearby spot of land these gangsters use to dispose of bodies. Not the best idea because they soon realize the forest is special ground and the dead are rising. Including all of those bodies they killed before.More assassins arrive to help the gang, KSC3 and the girl escape trying to make their way out of the woods and eventually the big boss shows and lets them all know who is in charge. All of this ties into the film's opening sequence and we realize the boss is the wizard and KSC3 is the warrior he faced long ago.Deep down the story here is fairly simple and not as complicated as it could have been. It sets up the good guys versus the bad and wraps it in plenty of gore and special effects as well as some decent martial arts action. The characters are all surface, almost comic book characters and that works to the advantage of the film. This is not social commentary, this is just plain fun. It's pure escapism of the best kind with tons of action, enough story to satisfy and a lot to enjoy.Knowing how good the movie is, knowing that Arrow is releasing their version only makes it better beginning with a brand new 2K restoration from original film elements by Arrow Films, approved by director Ryûhei Kitamura. Not only that there are both versions of the film: the original 2000 cut and 2004's Ultimate Versus, featuring over 10 minutes of new and revised footage. But this is Arrow Video. Surely there are a ton of extras. Of course!Those include an audio commentary by Kitamura and producer Keishiro Shin, an audio commentary by Kitamura and the cast and crews, a new visual essay on the career of Kitamura by Japanese cinema expert Jasper Sharp, BEHIND VERSUS a 2 part behind the scenes documentary about the film's production, FIRST CONTACT: VERSUS EVOLUTION a featurette exploring the film's origin, TAK SAKAGUCHI'S ONE-MAN JOURNEY an archival featurette about the actor's visit to the 2001 Japan Film Festival in Hamburg, film festival screening footage, TEAM VERSUS a brief look inside the Napalm Films office, DEEP IN THE WOODS an archival featurette featuring interviews with Kitamura, cast and crew, THE ENCOUNTER an archival interview with editor Shûichi Kakesu, deleted scenes with audio commentary by Kitamura, cast and crew, NERVOUS and NERVOUS 2 two side story mini-movies featuring characters from the main feature, a featurette on the making of NERVOUS 2, VERSUS FF VERSION a condensed 20-minute recut of the film, trailers, an image gallery, SAKIGAGE! OTOKO! VERUS JUKU a featurette on the newly shot material for Ultimate Versus, reversible sleeve with original and newly created artwork by Chris Malbon and for the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film and a reprinted interview with Kitamura by Tom Mes and notes on the making of the film by Kitamura.If you love the movie this is the version you need in your collection.

"If Sam Raimi and gotten drunk when he was 17 and made a movie about Japanese gangsters and zombies, it would have looked a lot like Versus.A couple of escapes from a Japanese prison with ""lawbreaker"" in English on the front of their prison jumpsuits meet up with a group of Yakuza gangsters in the middle of the forest. T he gangsters are there to pick up the prisoners and help them escape, but insist they wait for another man to arrive. T he prisoners don't care for that, especially one who looks like the boy band version of a badass. Boy Band Badass especially doesn't like it when he finds out the Yakuza have brought a kidnapped girl along with them. They man they're waiting for has plans for her as well, but Boy Band Badass grabs one of the gangsters' guns and demands they let her go. One of the gangsters gets shot deadand then he comes back to life as a zombie. As Boy Band Badass and the girl flee and the Yakuza pursue, we learn this forest is where the gang has been burying their victimsand they've all come back to life as zombies as well. What follows that is some really crazy stuff as Boy Band Badass fights the Yakuza and they all fight the zombies. Then the man they were all waiting for shows up and we find out this is all some re-enactment of an ancient battle for a dark power of destruction, only this is in modern times and everyone looks like they stepped out of a music video.There is an awful lot of this movie that is laugh out loud goofy. It is never boring, however, and these Japanese filmmakers do know how to film a fight scene. You can actually see what's happening and follow along, rather than the indecipherable blur of jump cuts and microsecond edits that mar most action scenes in American movies. But you can't take anything else in this film at all seriously.If you're high on some illegal or illicit mind-altering substance, you might have a nice trip watching Versus because it's very visually creative. If you'd like something you can bring home and MST3K with your family and friends, Versus might be a nice choice as well. But if you're neither stoned nor snarky, there's not much here to recommend.",negative
"Wow! What a great movie! From the very first minute to the final scene this movie seems like a defintion for ""action"". Incredible Swordplay, many, many shootouts, kung-Fu-fights and... yeah, right...zombies!!! But like ""Dead/Alive"" or ""Bad Taste"" it´s also funny as hell. Well, that description alone doesn´t sound all too bad - but it´s even better, cause ""versus"" has great style. To me, its wild visuals reminded me of such a classic as ""Evil Dead"", regarding its ""raw"" cinematography. But it also shares a lot with a movie like ""Matrix""- minus the multi-million-computer-fx. So, ""Versus"" appeals to all the senses an action-movie should: It drives you into your seat, makes you laugh till Kingdom Come, and it catches you with your mouth wiiiide open...remember my words, when you see the final swordfight. But there is one warning: You should be ready to walk knee-deep in gore - and become addicted to it!!!! 8 points",positive
"Versus is a Japanese movie that is quite challenging to classify. It includes elements of fantasy with portals leading to other worlds. It could be described as a horror movie due to the presence of murderous zombies. This is also an action film featuring shootings, martial arts and even swords fights. There are also minor thriller elements since we get introduced to two criminals who have escaped from prison and are tracked down by two officers. While such a genre potpourri might potentially be confusing, this overblown madness is exactly the film's guideline.The story is just as eclectic. Two detainees escape from prison and are supposed to meet with other criminals in a nearby forest. Things spiral out of control when that group brings along a kidnapped woman while their boss doesn't show up. One of the prisoners and the mysterious woman flee the scene and are followed by the criminals. However, the nearby forest isn't as calm as it seems as both parties soon face murderous zombies. They also learn that the gangster boss has led the prisoners and the woman to the woods on purpose as he has an evil plan on his mind.This Japanese cult movie is nothing for the faint-hearted. Instead of focusing on a consistent story, the movie consists almost entirely of crazy characters, violent fight scenes and tons of guts and gore. It's the kind of movie a teenager obsessed with video games would love to make. This unpretentious approach however is quite unique and entertaining from start to finish. The movie features numerous memorable scenes and the country roads, forests and rivers provide a gloomy, isolated and ominous atmosphere.On the negative side, the film's budget was extremely limited and it shows. The crew made the best out of it but some fight scenes look fake and the recurring locations end up getting a little bit redundant.This film has received a quite generous Blu-ray release by Arrow Media that includes a big booklet, the original version of the film as well as the ultimate version, numerous interviews, deleted scenes and even two short films associated to some characters in the film. This release might be expensive but truly offers value for money. Stick to the ultimate version of Versus and enjoy the bloody ride through mysterious Japanese forests to the fullest.",positive

"First off, I have to say that this is the best horror movie that I have seen in the last two years, from any country.  It combines the aspects of action movies like The Matrix, and all out gore and zombies from The Dead Trilogy by George A. Romero.  Add quite a bit of swordplay, and you have the perfect combination for a great movie.  This would be ranked #5 in my list of all time favorite movies.  To say the least, I was really impressed with this movie.  Proves that the horror scene is still alive in certain areas in the world.  Being from the states, I cannot offer any insight in the actor's abilities, except for the roles they play in this movie.  But all the performances are superb, from the main characters to the zombie extras. This movie is all about 666 existing portals to the ""other side"".  The main character is a prisoner who has been broken out of jail for an unknown reason.  He is unaware of his surroundings or what his captors have in store for him.  But the agenda is laid out soon enough.  He comes in contact with strange yet familiar characters who are small time gangsters and cold blooded murderers.  He then meets a woman who is being held hostage that he feels a strong bond with.  After the first zombie is introduced, they break from the group and try to sort things out.  Now that his prisoner friend has been executed, he is all alone taking on a small band of gangsters and a forest full of zombies.  Have to say that it is very comical to see a zombie with a gun.  Don't think that it has been done before.  These zombies are also capable of a few acrobatics also.  They start to sort things out and realize that they are in the Forest of Resurrection.  That the have been here over and over in their lives.  And there are many powerful forces within their surroundings.  And eventually find out who has brought them there and for what purpose.  Seems that the female contains the blood of resurrection, that can only be used once in her life.  The main antagonist in this movie is a total bad-ass.  Appears to be an expert with various weapons and martial arts styles.  There are a couple of time shifts in the movie that show exactly how lethal this character is.  They all keep crossing paths until the final battle.  All the secrets have been revealed and it becomes known that the whole purpose of getting them together is to send them to the ""other side"" so they can all be on the same side again. But it is not that easy, due to the fact that the protagonist has some skills also.  In the end, you see that this is a neverending battle, that continues over time and was started during the age of the samurai, or maybe even before.  This movie is really hard to find in the unrated version.  You can pick the r-rated version up at almost any movie chain, but have to search the net for the 2 disk unedited version.  There is a U.S. version with an English dubbed track, for those who don't care for subtitles.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror and/or action movies.  I rate this one 5/5 for great cinematic detail, perfect setting, great fighting scenes, and plenty of zombie gore.  A very powerful film that reminds us that Japan still has a few masterpieces up its sleeve.  Makes Ringu look like an episode of Sesame Street.",negative
"Versus aims to be a stylish, cool action flick with a healthy mixture of gore, gun-play, and martial arts. Unfortunately, a lot of those attempts at being stylish and cool, end up coming off as cheesy. All the silly posing and failed attempts at humor don't do a lot to help Versus, and neither does the fact that the characters are almost universally annoying and uninteresting. The story is something about zombies and resurrection forests and portals to hell. The word ""convoluted"" comes to mind. The frequent action scenes could have been the movie's saving grace, but they were uniformly uninspired and routine. The gore wasn't funny or copious enough to warrant any attention. The acting is bad. Not ""campy bad"" or ""hilariously bad"", just bad. The kind that's difficult to watch.If you couldn't tell, I thoroughly disliked Versus. I've seen a lot of great Japanese action flicks. This wasn't one of them.",negative
"Remember when you were at school and the teacher reminded you that you had an assignment or project due the next day, and that you had been aware of it for three months. And you hadn't even started yet...So rather than take the F you scrawled together some crap over night with some hastily arranged details and rambling barely coherent information that only partially touched upon what was required. Now imagine you sheepishly handed it in. And got an A.That my friends is Versus. I have seen this reviewed glowingly yet for the life of me cannot see why. It has received enough plaudits that one day I went out and bought it because I couldn't find it in any video shop, and boy do I regret that $15 now.Loosely put Versus is about a Japanese Forest that has the power of resurrection due to it being one of the gates to something or other, and every few hundred years a battle is fought between Japanese guys over who will rule the next while. That's at least what I jotted down before I gave up. The plot merely exists to have a bunch of sword fights, zombies and various costumes on screen in what amounts to little more than a student film.Depending on who they are attacking the zombies are either superhuman or consist of exploding jelly, they either stand there waiting to be shot or flip all over the place out of harm's way. Key characters fight, die, come back to fight and die again. Simply more bodies, more fodder for the rest. After the first 10 minutes it's all the same, and let me tell you the first 10 minutes are bewildering and lousy.There's lots of blood, lots of bullets and loads of bad acting. But this is the one point where Versus is a cut above. There is one actor in this film who simply must be seen to fully understand the level of his crapulence. There is not one moment where he is not at 100% ham, either poking his tongue out, jumping around like a demented animal or eye-bulging a reaction to the most mild dialogue.I can think of not one other thing that elevates this film to something worthy of being spoken about, or poor enough to raise a chuckle.I watched this. It sucks. Let's move on.Final Rating - 4 / 10. Two hours of Banana Splits production values and improv-night dialogue, all there so that some Japanese guys can have sword fights and shoot fake zombies while playing dress-ups.",negative
"I'll admit it. I was put off at first by the youth of the actors playing Yakuza and the swirly camera shots every time someone struck a pose -- a frequent event during the first 15 minutes. However, only someone who judges a film by the first few scenes could not love this insane collection of everything thrilling and funny in an exploitation film. Seen most of these action set pieces before?Yes.All in the same movie?Nope.Excellent music, sound, physical effects and acrobatics tied together by outstanding shot planning and editing, all of it photographed outdoors in an unadorned, un-spookified forest. Oh, right, Blair Witch did something like that before Versus. Well, try watching Blair Witch again without falling asleep in your chair.If you're going to call Versus unoriginal you'll have to point me in the direction of another Samurai/Eternal Lovers/Yakuza Zombie/Bullet Ballet/Kung-Fu/Flying Swordspersons movie first. Despite the sound of that combination, this film still manages to make more sense than some Hollywood A-list pictures.Best of all? Versus just gets better as it goes along, all the way to the very end.",negative
"I`ve got the japanese DVD (with english subtitles) just today...and I really love this film. Besides the really brutal scenes there is an interesting story (not very innovative, but interesting) and, and that`s the point, a coolness. The hero is cool, the bad guys are cool, everything is cool. If you think Neo in Matrix (I think director Ryohei Kitamura likes this movie) was a tough guy, you should watch the hero of VERSUS, only known as prisoner KSC2-303. This guy blasts everything, especially many, and I mean many, enemies. A film for fighting fans and fans of zombie movies as well. Try to watch this movie, you will love it.",positive
"Versus is basically a live action film that has all of the qualities of an anime: extreme unprejudiced violence, ungodly quantities of blood and gore, and martial arts that defy the laws of physics. I love anime, so the idea of such a movie immediately sparked my interest, but unfortunately this falls in the same category as 96% of real anime films, total crap. This movie is so bad that going into great detail about why would only waste even more of my time than I already have by watching it in the first place. The plot although ridiculous could have been used in an interesting way, but ended up being entirely irrelevant; by the time the viewer figures out why the hell the characters are involved in the situation they are in, he no longer cares. The movie is TWO HOURS LONG, an eternity for a low budget action flick that was made only for the sake of extreme violence (I found myself hitting fast forward after the counter hit 90 minutes). The violence itself is interesting for the first twenty minutes or so but wears thin very quickly. The dubbing is terrible, the dialogue is cheesy, and the acting is equivalent to that of a video game. There is not much else to be said about this garbage except that I find it interesting and ironic that the target audience for this film is far too young to view it legally. 3/10",negative
"Versus in (2000) is a action,horror,fantasy and comedy movie direct by Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura whom i really like after watching his American work like The Midnight Meat Train and No One Lives.After watching this movie i have to say what a interesting way to get into the mainstream audience and the world.Versus is a B-grade movie and it not trying to do something other than that,it chessy,over the top and ridiculously amazing.For a movie it has everything you dream of : yakuza zombie,John Woo awesome gun play,wuxia sword play,an bass ass main character and a cast full of people acting like their on some kind of heavy drug.As an anime fan like myself i really like the plot of this movie and i wish they explore it more but too bad it end with a cliffhanger.",positive
"VERSUS is a non stop action movie, where a lot of incoherent things happen but is always playing for fun. A lot of MORE SERIOUS movies are caught in the joke like THE MATRIX and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD but is the figure of the HEROE at the end of the movie that get the best joke. Filmed entirely on some forest with very few actors (some times you did not see their faces).  In the beginning it seems like a cheap class B (or C) movie, but after a while you understand that everything is really a joke with so much action, violence and gore that there is no time to get bored.The story is simple, two fugitives must meet one of them gang in a haunted forest.  The gang arrives but they are not friendly and have a woman prisioner.  One of the fugitives decides to save the woman and together try to escape from the gang. The problem is that the forest is a place were dead people (sometimes) resurrect and try to attack the living, so everybody must kill the ZOMBIES in goriest possible manner. Of course, there is some additional mystery and the end is really unexpected but no suspense.",negative
"First thing ""Versus"" started up, I was already groaning. The film quality was retro ""my neighbor's camcorder"", the acting was REALLY bad and it wasn't really living up to anything special. The music was okay, but I have a history of liking some strange music... also, sometimes the music is loud enough to where it's kind of hard to hear what is being said clearly.About twenty minutes in (do try to last that long), the mood changes and it becomes more bearable, and then the story kind of comes together. It starts becoming interesting (which until then, I felt I had just wasted thirty bucks to see this movie). The main character emerges (first twenty minutes will leave you going ""uhh... who am I suppose to be rooting for here?"") and they begin to develop what personality he has. I really feel that this movie would have been better left in Japanese with subtitles. The voice-overs, where-as they match up okay were fairly annoying in general (the bad guy and the good guy were done pretty well, but everyone else sounds like the old Hong Kong flicks from the 70s with the whiny voices)What I had envisioned was kind of a dark-souled samurai fighting the undead... What it ended up being was more of good/evil battle with the zombies being more of an excuse to fire off a bunch of bullets and to explain later events. Also, don't hold your breath for the sword-fighting, it comes kind of late in the film.The ending was fairly thought provoking, and aside from the fact blood is applied with a fire-hose, and none of the zombies are really ""zombie-ish"" (they're live people with a lot of blood on 'em and it shows) Versus really wasn't that bad.I'd probably suggest renting it, if you can find it at your local video store. This film is more for your die-hard martial arts/horror B-movie fan...",negative
"I saw this movie yesterday, and didnt quite know what to expect from it. I had read the user-comments at IMDB and being a fan of anime, asian and gory movies movies in general, it sure sounded promising.And i was not to be disappointed...This movie has it all. Intensity, wicked action scenes, gore, drama, humour, good acting and cool characters. Technically its a masterpiece, with the rapid and innovative camera-movements and fitting sound.They fight with guns, swords, hands and feet...and its a pleasure to watch. Their extreme physical skills combined with the camera-work and effects make the fights look just like the ones you see in anime movies. For those of you that doesnt know anime, i can assure you, that is not a bad reference to get. I would say the fight-scenes are only surpassed by a couple of the best Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies.I dont think i have ever seen anything like this before. Its a combination of many genres. Its ""Bad Taste"" meets ""Fong Sai-Yuk"" meets ""Hard Boiled"", and it works! If you got a slightly interest in any of those movies, you´ll love this.Its quite funny, it only takes some talented asians, a forest, a couple guns and swords to beat everything Hollywood has ever done in the action genre. People who appreciate good action should really try watching something else than Die Hard and Face-off. This movie deserves lots of attention.Watch Versus today!",positive
"Versus has a Forest of Resurrection, zombies, yakuza, samurai, and a reincarnated bad guy. What more could you possibly ask from a stylistic action movie? The visuals are great, the martial arts very impressive, and the plot quite surreal at times. I, too, am worried that there are people renting or buying this movie with the expectation that it's a serious drama. Hello, zombies? It has zombies in it. Z-O-M-B-I-E-S.For its genre, this movie is exceptional. If you're not really into zombies or stylistic action movies, then I can see how you'd dislike it. I can also see how the misogynist anti-hero might offend some viewers, but I thought it was a nice touch, showing how insensitive and anti-social he was. The dialog might strike some people as being quirky. I liked it, though.For people unsure of whether they'll enjoy Versus, I'd say that Versus is something of a mix between Re-Animator and Big Trouble in Little China. If that sounds good to you, make sure to check out Versus.",positive
"There isn't a single positive comment i can make about this movie. It was boring, uninteresting, unoriginal and just plain bad. The action was meh, humour was not funny, non-existing story and below par gore.Japanese gangsters are fighting zombies in a forest.",negative
"Awesome action movie that takes off from square one and only gets worse. The zombie slaughtering is almost up to class with Peter Jackson's Braindead. If you are into animé, this is the real thing. You got the lone wolf ""hero"", striking poses, slow motion, really nice circular camera movements, extreme bullet ballet, streetfighter/tekken like martial arts, swordfights and gallons of blood. There are insane bad guys some which have plenty of ""character"" and are so much you cannot do but laugh. Admittedly it gets a little slow right before the end when its only the two main characters left battling it out, but still great fun. A fun thing with the movie is that normally in these kinds of supernatural movies its pretty clear who is good and who is evil, which is not the case in this one.As this is a pretty extreme variant of an already narrow subgenre and the movie really excels at what it's supposed to do, I cannot but give this movie the full 10. Take note however, it is very very japanese and if you are not used to the type of movie you will be missing out on a lot, especially if you don't fancy the splatter and the adolescent ""coolness"" of the subgenre.",positive
"Unlike many, I was able to see this on a theater screen. Long as you don't stop to think, and it hardly gives you a chance to anyway, it's hilarious, jarring, whatever. Only the anti-climatic flash forward was a bore. Funny thing that hit me though, was the immortal girl, the one who's on the run with the prisoner. Can't tell from the credits which name, since both of the film's actresses have only ""Versus"" as a screen credit, but she's a vague, super unlikely doppelganger for Heather Matarazzo of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and television's failed ""Now and Again."" Same characteristic facial expression.",negative
"A lot of things have been said about this movie, and this combined with the premise of a zombie/yakuza/samurai theme had me very intrigued. I'm a sucker for those sorts of things you see, and you could probably imagine my glee with the blending of them all into a single package. Of course, I was by no means expecting anything thought provoking, neither was I expecting to be emotively moved, or anything really that could remotely get me to think. This is something I instead consider as 'leave your brain at the door' cinema, where the fundamental principle is not to encourage thinking but just to mindlessly entertain. However saying that I felt disappointed afterwards; It seems after all its hype; the movie with such a potentially great concept just couldn't pull it off, and in the end failed in its one and only objective. Versus is sadly a rather tedious movie that at times even borders on boring.There is no plot worth speaking of, and dialogue as you would expect is as a result rather lack-lustre. Cinematography is mundane and the characters two dimensional. Even the score is nothing worth writing about. What we have instead is a serious of fighting show pieces. Each in close succession. The plot is around only to try and add an degree of meaning to the various clashes, and subsequently falls flat on it's face. The plot simply put is confusing; with the various forces switching sides/gaining powers or even introducing new characters/ concepts on a whim. Thus the film is reliant upon the quality of its actions scenes more than anything else, and even these are nothing spectacular. The brief respite is that the blood and guts are very exaggerated, and this gives it an element of (intended?) comic relief. The movie however with very little variation from its 'FIGHT-talk a little-FIGHT-do something else-FIGHT' formula, gets a little tedious as you would imagine after a bit. Only a rather belated plot (I was wondering where that went) twist towards the film's end gives the starving viewer a small morsel of entertainment on which to nibble on. But the majority of us at this point would be to numb or confused to enjoy it.",negative
"Hilarious, dark humor with a dash of Peter Jackson punctuates this non stop action fest.  It's  a simple idea taken to ridiculuos extremes, but sometimes that's the best kind of film.  Earns extra points for parodying ""The Matrix,"" without resorting to the old bullet-time kung fu jokes.  I laughed my a$$ off for about 10 minutes at that part. 
If you don't mind gross outs, and you like HK style kung-fu, gunfights and swordplay, along with a little touch of Fulci, you'll love this.It's a very special film, bound to be a big hit among a very special (demented) group of people.",positive
"VersusThe stupid excuse for a plot was pretty high concept for a film so low budget they shot the entire thing in the woods. 'the forest of resurrection' excuse me. Some points of the story for example the fact that there are 666 portals to this other dimension was a laughably stupid concept. But I give them credit for making the most of the elements they had to work with. There was also at least one super annoying gangster who drove me crazy.That all being said I thought the movie still rocked. Watching Versus for an engaging plot is like listening to death metal for melody. Versus is a excellent piece of low budget pulp cinema that has Japanese gangsters, zombies, sword fights, martial arts and shows amazing potential of a young director.Well many did not like his follow up film(alive) I thought it was a better albeit totally incomparable film. I have yet see AZUMI which I have been told is great, and hey it land him the 50th anniversary Godzira film.If you like pulp movies versus is a must see.If have something up your ass that makes it impossible to enjoy anything that isn't 'art' well then rent some boring crap. Also on a side note this movie beats the tar out of JUNK which was held up by fangoria to be some great b-movie Japanese zombie flick. That movie is a turd compared to versus.",positive
"I got the directors cut Ultimate Edition which goes for a another 10 mins(if the length is right on this site for the original) I saw this movie before his brilliant effort Azumi which I gave a 10 on this site. Am about to see Azumi 2 which Kitamaru didn't direct unfortunately but the reviews rate it the same or better.You've got a lot of blood and body parts as you'd expect in a movie like this. Right from the start it was violent. The prisoner, the Man and the Girl tied into a story somewhat leading to an ending which I would never have seen, leaving you thinking which guy was the worst and also of course letting us wait for the sequel which I'm definitely going to see.I don't know the difference having not seen the original but extra mins of blood cant be bad. See it if you can, better if you watch this one before Azumi as you'll expect more in this movie if you watch Azumi first.",positive
"Bad Highlander (one of the sequels), meets bad The Killer or Reservoir Dogs, meets bad Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Kill Bill but, it's meant to be campy so, if you expect bad, you may enjoy it...if you are a zombie. The story is simplistic yet mysteriously convoluted. Not to mention the holes, not only in the zombies but, in the continuity of the story and its slim attempt to help us take that leap of faith. Do I care about the characters? The story? How it even ends....no, not really. The story is lame, the script is, oh so lame, almost as lame as my use of the word lame. The acting is even lamer yet its ability to explore the campy is enthralling. Hey this is a compliment, I've seen worse. Not much but worse. So I gave it a 4 rating. Come on, zombies with guns? Watch at your own risk.",negative
"As I read Yakuza+Zombies+Magic this movie looked like good fun. Being a fan of good Zombie cinema (and ""so bad its good"" flicks, too) I though I couldn't go wrong with this one. Sadly, this movie is just lacklustre and drags on and on and then some Here we have everything united that stands for a cheap Indi flick one would do with his friends in the wood (with just enough cash to get the blood squirting, etc). Versus is the stuff I would make up 20 years ago when playing with my Masters of the Universe or G.I. Joe figures. Most of the villains are from Standart List A of Bad Movies: Evil Villains. We got the stylish evil boss (who is thank god gunned down in under 60 sec.), we have the stylish-but-sadly-totally-mad evil villain (Kenji Matsuda, who act so over the top that he is the only character entertaining enough  sad thing is, after half the movie he is transformed into a stupid frog/ferret/whatnot undead/thing that is just totally ridiculous), and then we have the various henchmen: Seemingly evil rocker with honor and big gun, cool guy with glasses and maybe some gay love interest with the mad boss and the usual moron who goes totally mental from all those supernatural stuff happening around and acts as some kind of comic relief guy. Then  somewhat later  they also throw in a red-haired assassin with shades and the usual one to two female assassins with nice leather dresses and guns. (Look for the second one, she stumbles through the last third of the flick as if the director had forgotten she was still around). Also there is the indifferent ""real"" evil boss (Hideo Sakaki) who happens to be the second person with some acting talent. To all those more or less archetypal lads & lassies come two cops, who have some serious mental problems (one riding the ""studied in the USA with FBI  me hard guy"" joke until you wish they'd shot him already).Then we have of course the mysterious and totally cool Mr. Anti-Hero (who happens to suck big time, so you'll hope for the bad guy to kill him) and the even more mysteriously girl in white.All of them thrown into some sort of ""story"" and lo! let's kill off the zombies in the woods. Not that they are true movie zombies  they can be killed like anybody else. Maybe use some bullets more (which isn't a problem as all guns have at least double the ammo they should have).The whole movie then is, if not a roller-coaster then at least a tunnel of horror to ride, composed of ""standing around in pose"", ""martial arts fighting filmed from various angles and with many cuts to make it look fast"", ""random running around and fighting"" plus the old time evergreen ""totally ignoring anything close to storytelling"". In animated movies the fight scenes at least look cool. Nah, some of the fighting is cool, indeed  but the whole experience drags on for two hours! I mean, come on guys, without a proper plot and one page of dialogue: You could have done this in half the time. Maybe then it wouldn't have become so stale and boring at it was after one watches, and watches, and watches  and nothing new happens.But, as one can see on this very site, this movie again suffers from overvaluation and undervaluation as do many other movies. For some any damn flick another guy can find shitty is worth 10 stars and is ""the best film ever made"". The opposite fraction of course will give it 1 star and declare it ""the worst film ever made"". Man, this movie is just too mediocre. It's neither the orgasmic advent of a new type of movie, but it is neither the greatest bullshit ever filmed. But maybe this is another over-enthusiastic internet thing?If you like martial arts, some guys who happen to be dead but are not real zombies, bad acting, three-minutes posing before every damn fight and are easily distracted by story lines, watch it. Or just grab some beers, get some friends and watch it anyway  maybe you find it cool, maybe you just have a good laugh. I for my part just got bored. Maybe I take my old action figures out and do it again, better",negative
"I thought VERSUS was really fun. For a low-budget film, it's mind-blowing. It's about a pair of prisoners who escape from jail and meet up with a group of Yakuza gangsters in a forest. However, they start to realise that the forest they end up in is the 444th portal that connects the world to the other side, 'The Forest of Resurrection'.VERSUS is a film that's rather low on plot but the action scenes, the black humour, suspense and crazy camera work keep those that are watching in their seats.Even though low on plot it does have its plot holes, but this is definitely worth checking out.",positive
"If this is considered good for Japanese movies Japan should never make another movie again. This thing sucked more than just about any other movie I have ever seen.It is possible the translations were off a little bit so I will say the English lines were stupid and laughable.The box said that they were time traveling ninja zombies, I have never seen ninjas wear suits and shoot guns but apparently they do.It felt like it was 4 hours long and I kept falling asleep so there is a chance I fell asleep during one or two good parts, but I doubt it, if you liked this movie I am sorry, I am sorry that you have no taste and probably live in your mother's basement and eat paste.",negative
"""Versus"" is just one of those movies that you could watch with a couple of friends and a few bottles of beer. And it's also a good example why Japanesse cinema produces movies that Hollywood could never do.The plot revolves around an escaped convict who is chased by a group of yakuzas into a forest that as we learn from the opening text introduction holds a portal that connects our world with the other side. All is not well in that forest and our unlucky hero and yakuzas are about to learn it the hard way.Okay so plot-wise this might not sound all that impressive. But the way it's delivered. That is what makes ""Versus"" truly memorable. In just two hours we get an insane adrenaline rush of images mixing up yakuzas, zombies, kung-fu, gun-fu, samurai sword fight and of course lots of gore. All presented in a over the top comedic way. Director Ryuhei Kitamura's style of film-making reminds of something of a cross between Sam Raimi's ""old-school"" camera technique and John Woo style directed action sequences. This amalgam creates some very nice fight scenes with the camera-work perfectly capturing the intensity of the action. There is a certain problem of overusing it though, especially at the beginning where the 360 degree rotations should have been tuned down a bit. But that is forgivable, because it's easy to see how much fun the crew had filming it.Its fascinating what Kitamura succeeded in creating with such a low budget, from the stylish action scenes to the amusing performances by the cast, ""Versus"" has a very ""Evil Dead"" feel, demonstrating that entertaining movies don't necessarily mean they have to be big budget productions.",positive
"Ryuhei Kitamura's debut film explodes on the screen with a ferocity not seen since John Woo's glory days or George A. Romero's wet dreams. Versus is a film that is sure to achieve legendary cult status if it hasn't done so already. It combines the best elements of splatter-punk horror, Hong Kong style gunplay, Matrix-style martial arts, and finally 70's style samurai swordplay. Wow, how rare is that?!Kenji Matsuda literally steals the show during the first half, for his wacky performance that comes off like Chow Yun Fat on speed. The main character (sorry forgot his name) was also great as a sort of Clint Eastwood style anti-hero. If you have a weak stomach or if you are turned off by exquisite action choreography, then this film is not for you. But if you want a film that will literally blow your brains out of the back of your head, then definitely get your hands on a copy. It is definitely one of a kind.",negative
"You can usually judge the true success of film by gauging the reaction of its intended audience.  ""Versus,"" a low budget Japanese confection raiding the elements of graphic novels, anime, and the films of Sam Raimi and Lucio Fulci, was screened for the perfect audience as a Midnight Madness selection at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival.  After a spirited introduction of the director and some of the cast and crew, the film unspooled to whoops and hollers as the late-night crowd got into all the ultra violence, funny subtitled dialogue, and martial arts.  Then at about the 45 minute point of this almost two-hour film, silence set in.  No, it wasn't the late hour nor did the concession stand coffee run out.  The film just got repetitive and dull, despite some imaginatively staged and edited action sequences.  It picked up a bit in the last act, but the middle hour ruined the high spirits promised by the opening.Overall, ""Versus"" is an acceptable cult item. I certainly admired the energy and invention of the filmmakers who obviously made the most of a tiny budget.  (Almost the entire movie is shot in one forest.)  But in the end I wish they would have spent a little more time explaining their filmic universe rather than just tossing off random ""we just thought of this cool idea so we threw it in here"" kitchen sink riffs at the audience.  And, when are filmmakers going to take a cue from exploitation masters of the past? There's nothing wrong with an 80 minute movie!  Even the diehard Toronto Midnight Madness crowd will tell you that.",negative
"I had no idea what this film would be about and after watching I'm still not sure.  What I am sure of is that this film has everything, really fast fight action, loads of gore, guns and some great characters.  The film doesn't take itself to seriously and shouldn't be by the watcher either.  It seems to me that alot of the film pays homage to evil dead, braindead and a mixture of other films but is shot in a very original way.  The only bad thing I have to say is that the first half of the film is great fun, a little silly but not over the top, and i feel towards the end it kind of tipped over the edge and went to the extreme although still great fun I cant help thinking that the film would actually be so much better if a little more thought went into the last quater of the film as it consists of a large gun which blows holes in things but otherwise watch this film, you wont be dissapointed.",positive
"This is a crazy mishmash of a lot of swordfights, a lot of gunfights, zombies, horror, romance, and hard boiled crime thriller, and it does it pretty well.Its main flaw is its central character, who is a completely devoid of charisma. The girl actress is pretty weak and basic in her acting, but this main guy is just terrible in the acting department. Everyone besides these two are vibrant characters all with their quirks and nuances, so they all carry the story to make it interesting.There are numerous, intricate and complicated swordfights, and gunfights. The scenes are all accompanied by mildly off sounding rock riffs, and these work to give a lot of energy to the fighting scenes, but they clearly sound a bit amiss. It gets annoying to see some action scenes get repeated multiple times in quick succession of the same thing happening from different camera angles, like John Woo does, because it just happened, why are we seeing it again and again?There are story consistency problems in the film, as well as wildly illogical conclusions that the characters do, inside of the context of the world and story they are living in, which will lead you to ask multiple times of ""Why?"" for behaviors because it makes no sense.I don't like to bring up other movies and references because a movie should be judged by itself, but this one has clear rips or homages to Sam Raimi's horror style, John Woo's cinematography and repetitive action shots, and Quentin Tarantino's over the top quirky characters. The movie is blatantly lifting the admittedly great things from other film creators, so it's not a problem, it's just on the nose.All in all, it's a very worthwhile crazy roller coaster of a ride, the flaws are niggling enough to keep your thoughts tethered away from coming out of thinking it's awesome.",positive
"I must confess I'd never heard of this film, until my brother borrowed me his copy last week. ""What is all about"" I asked him ""It's a bit like Resident Evil and the Matrix"" he repliedI wasn't really a fan of either of those movies, but it did sound intriguing, I loaded the DVD up in anticipation. Eh? was my first reaction followed by, What the hell is going on?A load of japanese geezers running around in a forest shooting at each other and zombies. Whilst mugging to the camera, trying to look cool and stylish and nonchalant through the carnage. Yes that is the plot!, there is some mystical explanation for all this but it seemed to be more of an afterthoughtAnyway, about half way through whilst still trying to formulate an opinion about the movie, the missus quipped""This is crap, turn it off I want to go to sleep""You know what?

"Versus has everything anyone could ever want: sweet looking characters, guns, knives, cops, blood, Yakuza, zombies, goof-balls, damsels in distress, and style.I'm pretty sure that people will say the plot was confusing, and some parts didn't make any sense, but honestly, the good outweighs the bad SO much. For example: ""Hey, who's this guy who appeared out of nowhere and we can't seem to kill? Who cares! He just ripped out a guy's heart, bit it, and threw it away just because he could!""The characters are great. They're so cool, they don't need any names. All you need is a main character who looks sweet and doesn't give a damn about anything, has a trench coat and some guns, and eventually a sword, and you have a winning combination. The bad guys are equally sweet, with some of them being goofy, and some of them being almost as cool as the protagonist. And there's the random chick thrown in for plot purposes, but who needs plot anyway!Of course, you could still have all of these elements and have crap city, but Ryuhei Kitamura stylizes it up so much with his directing. You could just have the protagonist shoot a couple of zombies with different camera angles, or you could do what Ryuhei does: Has the protagonist run down a hill whilst punching a zombie in the stomach numerous times followed by him shooting 2 zombies in different directions while holding a gun in his mouth only to use later. Thats style.In conclusion, see Versus. If you're confused, who cares! Just watch it again, and wish you could've had something to do with this incredible film. 10/10",positive
"great little horror/action flick, set against the backdrop of a haunted forest in japan. i must admit, i was instantly drawn in by those elusive online trailers for the film. when i finally saw it though, i was a little disappointed with a few choices that the director allowed for the actors. there are a certain number of goofy elements in the film that were just not supposed to be goofy. such as the posing yakuza guys. they looked more like a japanese n'sync rather than baddies. and the whole vibe that i was getting from the film was the same i get from watching amateur, guerrila style short films my friends make. the problem is that they don't work with a $400, 000 budget. yet, they make the exact same quality films...curious! but i don't want you running in terror from this film if you get the opportunity to see this flick. it really is a great popcorn munching, beer guzzling, screaming at the tv kind of film that has a gore/action level tha, suffice it to say, is quite delicious. it's still a decent flick, just don't go in expecting an epic and you'll probably be blown away by Versus!",positive
"The way I describe it to people is that it's like Army of Darknesswith really cool fist fights, sword fights, and gunfights.  The movieis just loads of fun, directed with lots of style, edited superbly, andhas some very nice cinematography.  I paid 50 bucks to import theDVD sight unseen on a recommendation from a friend, and it wasworth every penny.  If you are an idiot, like the first user commentlisted(I am loath to comment about other people usually, but I'venever seen someone criticize so many great movies), then youshould probably skip this one.  By anyone who can actually enjoy amovie that tries to do no more than entertain you would be wise totrack a copy down.  Get some friends together and enjoy yourself.",positive
"Paid 50 bucks for the japanese DVD of this without seeing it on the advice of a friend.  Gotta say...totally worth it.  Pretty much non stop action, its perfect as a party movie.  Invite lots of people over and let the fun begin.  Fantastic fight scenes, cool gunplay, lots of style, great cinematography...i was in heaven.  If you can get your hands on this, pay the money, you wont be sorry.",positive
"Versus is the epitome of low-budget.  Actually, calling this movie ""low-budget"" is an insult to all other low-budget movies.  Versus looks like it was made by a bunch of college guys with Sony handycams out in the middle of the woods.  And chances are they spent all their money on swords, guns, leather jackets, ketchup, and a postage stamp on the back of which they wrote the entire story AND script.  The acting is really cheesy and the dialogue even worse.  Sure, there's some cool fighting scenes...wait, actually the entire movie is nothing but fighting scenes.  It gets pretty dull after the first couple of fights.  How many rip-offs of the Matrix or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fighting scenes do we have to see anyway?? And adding zombies to the mix is just plain silly (it was like watching a Japanese version of Resident Evil only more boring 'cause you don't get to use a joystick to control the main characters).  The only saving grace was some of the low-brow humour that cropped up every once in awhile (eg. a zombie's eyes get stuck on one of the character's hands after he punches through the zombie's head; or another character tries to dodge a cannon blast à la Neo from the Matrix bending over backwards but gets blown to bits instead).  I usually like to watch movies from start to end regardless of how terrible they are, but Versus is one of the few movies I've been tempted to give up on after the first ten minutes or so (only once have I ever stopped watching a movie after the first ten minutes--that movie was Extreme Ops--I didn't want to risk permanent brain damage).  I compromised by fast-forwarding my way through most of the fight scenes (ie. I fast-forwarded through practically the whole movie) just to get to the end. You could probably watch the LAST ten minutes of the movie and get the gist of it.1 out of 5 Stars (add a star if you're watching it at home and can fast-forward at will or have PIP on your TV so you can watch something else at the same time; subtract a star if you paid good money to watch this and can't get a full refund)",negative
"I took notice of Versus due to the hype surrounding it, hence my chasing it down. Finally grabbing hold of it, I watched it with my valentine... a right move, since this movie is not to be watched alone.Let's get the ""plot"" out of the way. Two escaped prisoners. An ominous Forest of Resurrection where the dead return to life as zombies. A band of yakuza there to pick up the escapees. ACTION ENSUES.To start, ""Versus"" is possibly the blender out of which poured out many, MANY film genres: absurd comedy, action, martial arts, horror/zombie, fantasy, superpowers, gun-fu, what-have-you... it's a mix and match of various genres that we are all aware of. There is enough gore to keep it interesting, enough sword fights to polish it, enough bullets to put John Woo to shame, enough wacky characters (the entire yakuza team) to keep you laughing on and on, zombies with guns, random characters that just pop out of nowhere, TO BE BLUNT: IT'S INSANE.You have your yakuza, the quirky, sanity-defying gangsters hanging around; you have your ""badass hero"" who just doesn't care about anything, you have the ""obligatory female lead"" who gets slapped around throughout the movie, you have the calm-as-hell villain who is borderline incredible, you have your staggering, gun-wielding, throat-ripping zombies, you have shootouts, gunfights with both shooters at point-blank-range to each other, sword fights, one-on-one unarmed combat, wacky cops that somehow get into the mix, you have people stabbed, shot, sliced apart, blown to bits, you have everything you can ask for in an entertaining flick! My advice - get this one! Get it, get a few friends, watch it with an open mind and you'll get almost 2 hours' worth of entertainment!",positive
"It has been said that mimicry is the highest form or praise.
The writer/director, Ryuhei Kitamura <http://imdb.com/name/nm0457565/>, obviously loved The Matrix and also enjoyed the occasionally George Romero living-dead flick. He also pays tribute to traditional samurai movies. The budget for this movie must have been fairly low as most of the movie takes place in the forest yet the attention to detail with regards to the direction, editing, etc. clearly shows how the production was more a labor of love than something done just for the sake of doing. After reading some of the other reviews here I had the impression that this movie had no plot and was pure action from start to finish. On the surface this would appear to be true but if you dig deeper there is some substance here. I believe it tries to illustrate the continual battle between good vs. evil and the balance that must exists so that one never has a large advantage over the other. Roles change, perspectives change but the conflict continues ad infinitum. This film plays out like a comic book. The scenes are full of quick cuts and zoom-pans, where the lens zooms in on the subject while the camera physicallymoves further away. This keeps the aspect ratio of the subject the same while making the background appear to move closer. The director uses as many techniques as possible to add style to the film without the addition of special effects.
This is no Citizen Kane but it is a good effort and the cast and crew obviously had lots of fun. If you enjoy creative cinematography, loads of style, tons of guns and martial arts acrobatics (and don't forget the zombies) then this movie is for you.
I'd like to see what the director does for his next project.*** out of *****",positive
"These are questions you should ask yourself if you're planning to watch this movie. 'Cause I read quite a few people here saying they hate Versus, and that it's stupid, that they don't get it, the worst movie they ever saw, and so on... Guess they don't watch a lot of movies. And I'm sure they don't like shooting movies, or they don't like fight movies, or zombie movies, or they don't like any of them - maybe they even don't like movies at all! So, if you're one of these persons, you shouldn't waist your time here - or shouldn't waist this movie with your time. This is about people getting killed or hit, not because it's necessary to the plot, but because it's funny. About characters doing gestures and poses not because they should, but because it's stylish.If you don't like it, well, what a pity! But maybe you should consider that there's nothing wrong with the movie itself, but just a limitation in your ability to appreciate things. I watched this movie during the night and had to control myself all of the time not to laugh so hard I would wake up all of my neighbors.Besides, the fighting is great. The main character is great - probably born in Dostoievski's mind or something. The villain is great. The cop who knows everything is great. I've recommended this movie to all of my friends already. Now I recommend it to you.Watch it, if you do like John Woo and zombie movies. It's great.",positive
i recently bought this movie and after seeing it i am glad it was one of the best movies I've ever saw the fight scenes are fast' furious and explosive the end fight scene is to die for and the actors are amazing they do a great of overplaying the characters by turning them in ego-maniacal gun totting psychos and one very scared little man with tak sagutchi as the main man is amazing as a fighter protector and overall hero with the unusual side of villain that doesn't mind leaving a few bodies behind as he passes even the idiot police who thinks he's invincible is as hilarious as they come. the soundtract is Good also as it matches the fast flowing action perfectly but don't take my word for it buy/rent this movie and decide for yourselves you'll see the fast gun shooting action combined by the amazing swordplay in the movie will have you amazed and talking about it for months.,positive
"I bought this movie partially due to the reviews on IMDb and partially due to the reasonably cheap price that was staring at me every time I went in at my local store, little to my knowledge did I realise that this film was going to suck big time... I'm never going to get those two hours of my life back...I went into the viewing of this movie with an open mind, I had time to kill, felt like procrastinating, putting off my studies and just vegging out with anything. This picture was painfully annoying to the point where I wanted to take out the DVD and just hurl it into the wall within the first half hour, but through my indomitable spirit I managed to persevere.The action in parts overall was nothing special and quite shoddy, there were some good elements of wire work but generally it was quite poor. Character profiles were practically non-existent, and some were just stupendously bad, however the main guy had something quite cool going on but would have looked better placed in a Levi's commercial. The general story of the film was quite one-dimensional, a lot of blanks and moved at a ridiculously slow pace in places for my expectations of a zombie-yakuza action flick. On a more positive note the cinematography wasn't too bad, some nice forest scenes here and there, but it's not much consolation if everything else is awful.I gave this movie 2/10, I really wanted to give it 1, looking back now I still may do that depending on my mood upon completing the review, but I thought the main guy didn't do too badly so he pushed it up a notch. I would not recommend this film to anyone, but if you must see it then please do not give it credit by renting it let alone purchasing a copy, just download it, allow it to marinate a little in your thoughts then discard those memories, preferably with the film.",negative
"_Versus_ is largely entertaining if you're in an accepting or apathetic mood.  It is action-packed, but sparsely involving, long on influence and lean on innovation.  There's a lot of ""o-KAY, we get it"" moments, so the film is too long in total duration and in its exposition on individual elements.  So this guy screams a lot.  So they're the bad guys.  So he's the REALLY bad guy.  And the character played by Kenji Matsuda, Model/Yakuza #2 I guess, is easily as bad as Jar Jar in Episode I.  He's always sticking his tongue out and making noises and gesturing like the Gangster Fairy or something.  The dude is hard to take, and he's in it for the long haul, which for _Versus_ is no small journey, especially with this guy gnawing on your senses the whole time. So... scratch that, it's only marginally entertaining. 6/10",negative
"Fairly light on plot, but has some interesting characters (and good actors). What sets this apart from a pure B movie are the fight scenes, which are well done, in real close with what appear to be fast motion hand-held cameras, which makes the fights the best part. If anyone has time to kill, I'd recommend it. Just don't expect a storyline with any deep meaning.",negative
"This movie is pure entertainment. Like some of the previous comments, there is no intelligent plot line here - but who cares! Its sad when an attempt at an ""intelligent/mature"" film turns out daft. In this case the objective is to, intentionally create a ""daft"", (or, more properly) pointless comedy/horror/action picture. The result is strikingly entertaining.There are a few western references which are also quite funny. The references to Mike Tyson's reflexes and Yellowstone National Park don't fit, but add to the charm and humor of the film, even if, possibly unintended.I think it's Kenji Matsuda who deserves some acclamation for portraying the most hilarious of characters, who gets increasingly funny as the film progresses as well as the 2 police officers hunting down the prisoners.There is plenty of violence and humor to satisfy any horror film fan's appetite. I find the best horror films make you laugh as well as squirm which is why Versus is a diamond in the rough.",positive
"...that doesn't mean it's bad, not at all, just the story and plot are as simple as possible, but that's exactly what Ryuhei Kitamura wanted when he made this film and that's what makes this movie great. Ryuhei Kitamura wanted to make a movie that was everything Hollywood wasn't, he wanted to make an action film that was a nod to all the 80's action films, primarily Commando, in commando nothing is explained it all just happens and that is pretty much what happens this movie as well. Some ppl complain that this movie is bad for a movie made in 2000, they just expect to have the most amazing special effects that money can buy, but what some don't realize is that not all movies have a budget of millions of dollars, and the quality of a film can't always be like Hollywood; also Ryuhei Kitamura wanted to give the film a old vibe to it, he wanted to make it dated, he wanted it to look cheesy not just because of budget constraints he just wanted to make a action film that was 80's style. The movie is not for everyone, especially those too accustomed to Hollywood calibur movies, this is a movie for those who hate Hollywood and it's evil ways (I sure hate it for the remakes it keeps popping out)but also for the fan of the 80's action films and the HK john woo films. This is a great film, good plot, funny/hokey characters, and amazing action scenes, but the best part of this movie is...the zombie samurai's great great stuff! -if you are a die-hard fan or just interested check out the 2-disk DVD (it's available at Futurshop, or at least thats where i found it) but there is 2 good behind the scenes featurettes that explain Ryuhei Kitamura's thoughts on the film and what he was going for it cost about 40$ Canadian, but if you like movies it's well worth it.",positive
"Q: What are you up to? A: Something bad.I don't really know what to say about Versus. The lines above are sample dialogue. There's little exposition, apart from a scant block of text at the beginning. Characters appear with no rationale or introduction. They all seem to have guns, except for the ones that have swords. If nothing else, this film has taught me a few things.1: There's really no limit to the number of times a Japanese fighter can pose in a scene, not to mention an entire film.2: Zombies really aren't very dangerous, even when they have guns.
3: When budget and talent limit the ability to choreograph a fight, giving at least one fighter a trenchcoat and long hair is a good idea. They can both be flapped around, distracting the enemy and audience.
4: My living room is sorely lacking two things: a keg of beer and about ten more people to watch this film with me.I'm thinking that this would make a pretty good party film. It's all action, most of it filmed in a manner that ranges from Decent to Very Dodgy, sticking typically around Inspired Amateur. It all takes place in a forest, presumably so the small budget could be spent entirely on guns and makeup. I'd bet that even the craft service table was stocked with the array of foodstuffs that can be made from recycled Karo Syrup-based blood. There's no distracting plot or sense of reality and the violence is hilarious when it's not just repetitive. Beyond that, there's not much to it. It's funny because it's so stupid but I'd expect many people would be easily bored with Versus. While the action is non-stop, the effects aren't particularly good, especially when compared to films like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and Dead Alive. Both of those did far more and had more amusing characters. (Dead Alive long ago established itself as the benchmark for funny splatter films.) Versus ends up being way too long (120 minutes!) and would have been better off using the money for 30 of those minutes on more inventive choreography and effects. The running time certainly isn't justified by the story, though the very end of the film is somewhat more amusing than the 30 minutes that preceed it.Just keep a couple things in mind: everything in the film is from another picture and the accolades heaped on the photography are not to be trusted. If those don't sound like detriments and heaps of foolish cartoon violence are on the menu then by all means, full speed ahead.",negative
"Well three years ago I walked into a Blockbuster Video and saw Versus sitting there. I saw a sword and a gun and I picked it up. After reading the back of the DVD case I fell in love. ""This movie has to rock!"" alas I was broke and my girlfriend wanted nothing to do with am action movie, so I resolved to watch it another time. Fast-forward to present day. I stopped by my good friend's house and noticed he had bought Versus. I told him I had to borrow it.Now that I've seen Versus, I am somewhat satisfied that I finally saw it, but I still have many problems, and praises.After my initial encounter with the DVD case I was expecting a thought provoking action film. Well thats what the synopsis led me to believe.Versus is a brainless, zombie/action/comedy flick that is pure entertainment. That is if you want to be entertained. This movie lacks many things like a budget, decent acting, a believable story, and inspiring locations. (It all takes place in the woods.) The movie screams student film, which 9 out of 10 times means trouble. The plus side is that this movie kicked ass in a hard way. The cinematography was excellent, the action amazing, and the comedic dialog was funny (to a point).The 2 serious problem I had with this movie is that green shirted Yakuza. He was possibly the most obnoxious character to ever be projected. The other thing is the complete drop off at the half way point. This movie got boring fast. If it were tightened up to about an hour thirty and lack the terrible green shirted dude, this movie would honestly get a 10 out of 10, but those two factors dropped it down to a 7.I'm totally down with low budget, cheesy, exploitation flicks, but I am not down with being annoyed and bored. Sorry.",negative
"Versus is one of the most creative, stylish, and entertaining movies I've ever seen.  You really can't beat zombies, swordfighting, kung fu, and shoot-outs all in one movie.  It's a beautiful thing.Versus deserves a good Region 1 dvd, full-blown with all the extras.",positive
"Lots of people getting holes made in them and crazy oriental people. I was all like: ""Oh yeah! Thats what I'm talkin' about!"" I really like crazy people. And i love movies with crazy people in them even moreso. So, I loved it. I dropped my pizza during this movie. People killing each other is so great. Especially when most of them are zombies. Everyone loves zombies. People taking bites of other people's hearts n junk. Punching holes in someones head and yanking out their eyeballs. I wander what happened to that one dude who went all crazy and got away. oh well. Sad to know most people in the future, 99 years later,  have no hair. Did it all fall out?My friend made triscuit dealies. Just Triscuits with a pickle slice on them and melted cheese. That junk was good. You should try it.",negative
"It's funny that so many fans of Japanese films generally claim that this hunk of garbage was what got them into seeing foreign flics. That's pretty sad considering this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie has no idea what it want to be, first it starts out as a prison escape/gangster movie. And about 20 minutes in it turns into a zombie movie, and it just degenerates into an ultra violent and boring action movie that happens to have zombies in it. Until at the very end it turns into a HIGHLANDER rip off.In case you haven't seen this movie (lucky you) I'll just give you a brief overview of the ""plot points"" in the movie. Two guys break out of jail, meet up with gangsters. A gangster dies then comes back as a zombie. They spend the next HOUR shooting zombies in a small enclosed part of the forest. And since they didn't want to spring for a lot of extras the zombies are just about impossible to kill. Then some demon/zombie guys show up. They have some painfully stupid one on one fights, none of which are fun to watch or have a satisfying finish.Then the two main characters have a big brawl with swords highlander style. Try not to yell ""There can be only one highlander!"" during this fight, go on I dare you. And the villain dies, or so you think. Fast forward 5 million billion years (or something like that)and now the hero is holding the heroine hostage from the villain and it just kind of ends. How did she live so long? Who cares. Not me, I was so apathetic and bored by the closing credits I honestly didn't give a damn how ANYTHING in this turkey was supposed to have worked out plot wise.I would suggest turning off the dub, but the reality is the horrible acting transcends the language barrier. And frankly the guy who licks everything and never shuts up is annoying in either language, and he's in the move WAY, WAY to long. Just avoid this crap shoot.",negative
"Versus is a simply brilliant low budget film. To enjoy it you must realise that it is a film that does not take itself too seriously so you shouldn't either. This film is very funny, disgusting and full of incredible action all at the same time and it WORKS perfectly. Almost all the characters in versus are very entertaining and memorable and none of them even have names!The fight scenes are amazing - from a huge gun battle with zombies, cool hand to hand combat (watch out for the fight between the main character and the gangster with the knives - funny as f***!)to an incredibly cool sword fight at the end. I love the wacky yakuza gangsters especially the mad guy with the knives - one word - ""classic"". Even the music is cool from the bad beats when the gangsters pull up to the hilarious theme music for the crazy cops.The dub is absolute crap - stay away from it at all costs. Look out for the the guns that get bigger and meaner as the film progresses -The plot is not great but for a low budget film the rest of it makes up for that with excellent acting and great action and comedy - a fantastic film give it a chance - at the very least it is worth a rent.",positive
"Braindead eat your heart out.This film is quite staggering. Someone once said to me that Desperado was great purely due to the inventiveness of the way characters died. Well this has to be the king of them all. Not only did they have to come up with one death for each actor but then they would rise up again and have an even better one.It's a pity that more people won't see this film. I see that at the time I write this, only 648 people have voted on it even though it was made 3 years ago. We must market it ourselves people! I just hope that everyone who has voted, have sold it to there families and friends.I used to shy away from subtitled movies but in the last two months I've seen Ring, The Eye, Battle Royale, and now the cream of the crop, Versus. I vow to change my naive ways and to sample more.Bring on Ichi The Killer.",positive
"this has to be one of the slickest movies that ive seen in a long time. being a huge fan of martial art movies ( anything from the 70's kung fu movies to the crap americans try to make ) i belive i know a thing or two about action and how its supposed to be played out and let me tell you Versus does that plus more.short plot outline: we have a couple of escaped convicts that meet up with a gen x Yakuza group in the middle of a somewhat spooky forest. none of them really know why they are supposed to be there and after one of their dead gang members turns into a living corpse they stop caring about the whys as all hell breaks loose. after that the plot is just a glue that sticks all the events together, so dont go see this movie thinking its one of those psychological screw with your brain and make you loose sleep type anime movies, this is an action film pure and simple.review: amazing, when i first got a copy of this film i watched it about 3 times in a row. this is one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face as you watch it, and trust me it can be watched over and over. lets see what is there not to praise about this film, the cinematography is great, the camerawork is one of those best ive seen in martial art films its on par with Yuen Woo Ping and John Woo as far as style goes, the acting was awesome i especially loved the one Yakuza member with the daggers, cant recall his name, hes one of my favorite characters now. but hes not the only one thats great all the characters in this film are very well acted out with a very anime style, you got your quiet calm hero, the crazy funny bad guy, the gay guy, the kind of annoying girl, a tough loyal martial artist and the sick demented boss. i dont think i even need to mention the awesome quality of the martial arts and gun play shown in this movie. its just plain superb, especially the final showdown between the two main characters, then again that showdown is the reason why you watch the movie.anyone who is a fan of action anime martial arts and japan cinema should see this. i cant recommend this movie enough",positive
"Spoilers.I had first heard of the film ""Versus"" after going to various horror movie message boards, and websites. But, it was only recently when I got into Asian horror movies that I looked more into this one.Though not horror, it's definitely one of the best action movies of recent years, and one of my favorites. I loved it so much in fact, I watched it 4 times, when I rented it. Which is very unusual for me, since the most I ever watch a movie when renting it was twice, and I only had the movie for 5 days. I watched it that morning, then that night. Then, I watched it the next night. I skipped a day, then watched it the morning after, before it had to be taken back. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. Or at least, some of my personal favorites. I'm sure a lot of people think they over did it, which I don't blame then for thinking that, but I certainly don't! I thought Tak Sakaguchi was extremely cool as Prisoner KSC2-303, and not bad to look at, either. Anyway, on a more serious note, I can't think of one thing I didn't like about the movie. So, I'll just have to go on telling you how much I absolutely loved it some more. Well, first there's the plot, which I am obviously quite fond of, since I like everything about the movie. I liked the music, I liked the cast, and I like the little bit of humor they threw into it here, and there. I also liked the end of it, too. I liked that it made way for a sequel, and it made way for plenty of conversations, and theories about the end. I have my own theory, which I don't feel like getting into right now. A theory I thought was sort of made clear, but I can see why there are so many out there. I guess we'll have to find out when Versus 2 comes out, assuming they're still going to go through with it. Needless to say, I cannot wait.I highly recommend this movie.",positive
"""Versus"" is easily one of the best action movies I have ever seen. After seeing it at a rental store I decided to give it a try, it sounded decent, and being a fan of action and Japanese cinema I said why not? Wow, was I blown away. First off make sure you get the unrated version and not the R rated one, there is a huge difference. It is way more bloody and has more action scenes than the R rated one. One of the few films in my opinion where you can actually tell the difference between the unrated and R rated versions of a movie. I know a lot of people complain that the story is stupid or the characters are lame, but that is pretty arguable. If you watch it more than once (and you probably will after seeing it once) you will pick up more on the story, which may be unclear or not noticeable to the casual movie watcher. This is a really original one of a kind film. Kitamura did a nice job with a low budget and a lot of great camera work. Some of the best cinematography I have seen in any film. The last few minutes of the final confrontation between the two main characters is one of the greatest action shots ever. Beautifully filmed as the camera pans between the two characters and the sound and the music is just spot on. None of the other action scenes are shot like this, which really makes it stand out amongst the rest. Speaking of the action, it is simply stunning. If you are a fan of blood and gore you are in for a real treat. If you are a fan of over the top action you are in for a real treat. The movie never lets up and has some nasty ways to kill a zombie that's for sure. The way the characters act in the film is as if you were watching an anime come to life. From the dialogue, gestures and movement, and even posing for the camera, it really plays off as a cartoon come to life, which turned off some people. I however like it, and just for the action alone this movie is really worth seeing. Tak's character is one of the coolest characters I've seen and even Hideo's is really good too. Granted you are not going to get any Oscar winning performances, but you will be entertained. ""Versus"" is a film I highly recommend for any action/gore/zombie/Japanese/martial arts fan.",positive
"This is truly one of the best examples of the new fringe Asian cinema genre. From the opening credits till the end credits this film is nonstop action. The fight scenes were choreographed by the same crew that did Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. Its pretty much Yakuza vrs zombies in a forrest. The fight scenes (pretty much like 90% of the film) are absolutely awesome! This is like wathing an anime/manga come to life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies-manga/anime and definately to anyone who likes the new Japanese genre of crazy movies (such as Fudoh-The Story Of Ricky-Ichi The Killer-Dead Or Alive-Run And Kill-etc). Before this I thought Hard Boiled was the most intense action packed movie ever but this blows Hard Boiled away. Relentless! Right now I believe Versus is only available ""bootlegged"" but I think Tokyo Shock is doing a US DVD release soon. Definately a must own!",positive
"Versus had some great action and martial art scenes, but the story itself wasn't that great. I guess this movie is for people who are only into action regardless of a real storyline. Much of the action is very well staged with John Woo-style action, mixing athletic sparring with Sam Raimi-styled camera tricks and state of the art gore right out of Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive""/""Braindead"". SPOILERS!The premise is pretty weak. But the strong points goes something like:
     ""Fated by the past. Destined by the future...""     500 years ago, the fate of the world was in the hands of two brothers, both who were mere immortal beings. But both had their own intentions: One strived for ultimate power which will enable him to become immortal to annhiliate the world. The other, was destined to save the world by killing his brother. But in the bloody end, the hero lost, and the evil brother took the place to determine the fate of the world.     500 years later, the hero was reincarnated, but the memory of his past was concealed. But soon the memory of his past will be awaken, as he will then see the truth--his true purpose of existence, to find his brother through fate and destroy him. And when he meets his brother, his fate will become his destiny...That's the small portion of the premise. The rest is very complex. The movie takes place in a forest. The story consist of different things like samurais, Japanese mafias, violence, a girl, more violence, zombies, 666 portals having the 444th one in Japan, and did I mention violence? LOTS AND LOTS of violence! The first fighting scene was awesome, but the fights after that were all the same and it got pretty dull throughout the movie, except for the last fighting scene. I won't spoil the last scene before the credits, but it's something that would make you anxious to watch the sequel! 7 out of 10",negative
"This is, without a shadow of a doubt, is the finest Japanese kung-fu zombie movie ever made. For a film that has next to no budget, it looks just as good as any other blockbuster release out right now. With uber-stylish cinematography, no plot in sight and some of the most bizarre characters characters ever committed to celluloid, this can not do anything but entertain. Just sit back and lavish in a film that is obviously not afraid to use a little ketchup and corn syrup to raise a few smiles. You won't be able to not enjoy watching very annoying gangsters be eaten, torn limb from limb and being blown to smithereens. Very enjoyable indeed.",positive
"OK, Versus has a plot, sort of. Something to do with a 500 year old vendetta passed on somehow to the current players and a girl who may represent some form of savior or an ancient princess whose sacrifice can open the 444th portal to the ""other side""? If I sound ambiguous that's because the story is. Must have been the Forest of Resurrection playing tricks. Maybe just the spirit of the battle was passed on? Or maybe that spirit makes these men who they are? Or maybe I was a few cards short of a full deck at the post bar late Friday night screening? No matter. Much like any of the HK Kung-Fu flicks the story is almost always secondary to the action. Same with Versus.I saw this film at the first annual Idaho Int'l Film Festival on the big screen and let me tell you it was a blast watching the midnight showing with an audience. Versus is just plain fun. We laughed out loud over a dozen times and cheered on the heros in battle. There are many hilarious scenes such as one zombie throwing another whose hand has been chopped off a hand he picks up off the ground and the second zombie laments; ""But I'm right handed"". It's like watching 4 genre movies all at once. If you like Kung-Fu, stylish gun play, well choreographed sword fights, zombies, lots of zombies who fight back and won't take no for an answer even after being shot 12 times or having parts of their bodies lopped off then you'll love this movie.The direction as well as the camera work are first rate often using the rotating technique moving around the characters posing getting ready to fight with dizzying effect before they spring into action settled in but a few short blows by the master swordsman. There's also those long pan-in shots until only the actors eyes fill the entire screen showing the steely resolve that no words could ever convey. Great stuff.I have to comment that Versus must be seen in a theater with a Dolby, THX, or better sound system if possible because the sound effects as well as the music score are half the fun. There was more than one time I jumped at a sound edit. It was like stepping off the curb and turning your head for that spilt second just in time to see the speeding truck hit you...IMPACT! Also during the 500 year ago Samurai sword fight scenes the traditional Japanese music soundtrack added so much atmosphere along with the scenery it was breathtaking. The violence, while graphic, does not have the gratuitous nature common of Hollywood films. The editing gives one more the ""sense"" of the violence that the ""seeing"" of it while working with the sound effects to create the intended visual impact during the fight scenes. Director Ryuhei Kitamura comments; ""This type of film shall be known as 'Freefall Ultra-Violence Non-Stop Entertainment Action'"". Works for me. A 7 out of 10 based on it's pure entertainment value.",negative
"The idea of making a Martial-Arts-Zombie-Movie is a great one but there are too many reasons why i consider this movie as bad. The plot is somekind of boring and predictable. The effects were very cheap(cheaper than those of ""Story of Ricky). The Martial-Arts Scenes aren`t nearly as good as those from HongKong and the characters pretend to be much harder than they look like.",negative
"This is a movie to watch when you're not in the mood for highbrow entertainment. Basically the plot exists in order for the filmmakers to have a setup for the main characters to fight.  On that level it succeeds.  If you're looking for good writing though, well, look someplace else.  It also felt about 30 minutes too long for me, as some of the twists in the writing just slow the movie down (a subplot with two minor characters, for instance, should have been left on the cutting room floor).",positive
"I was recommended this movie by a friend after watching Oldboy and Bittersweet Life, and I don't know why!After being told that this was 'the greatest film ever' I decided to take a look......It's not the greatest film ever. However it does deserve an accolade, but at the other end of the scale!THE WORST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN!It's set in some haunted woods where yakuza gang members once buried now return as shuffling (and I mean shuffling) zombies. 2 prison escapees are about to be picked up by a gang of 'cool' heavies after escaping their police escort when all hell breaks loose. Well, it tries to at least, but all 'hell' can manage is a few stumbling, useless zombies with terrible make-up that looked more you'd just missed your mouth with a hamburger and the ketchup had run down your cheek. Also, the location design consists of any random woody place, with no set at all, hell, even the guns have that 'spark effect' where sparks fly out the barrel of a gun when shot, a 'special effect' I actually used at college in 1993 by using matchsticks flying through the air. Utter guff, don't waste your time or money like I did.The formula for this film is this: 1. Give man gun. 2. Quick zoom camera shot towards man with gun. 3. Play high tempo futuristic music. 4. Make man utter cool comment. 5. Start jumping around shooting non moving zombies. 6. Make another cool comment. 7. Run off into woods.And repeat for 2 hours.",negative
"Just watched Versus, and it was damn good. Good action, decent acting, decent gore. Very old school action and horror elements, no cheap scares and CGI. The fight between the main hero and villain at the end kicked total ass, as did most of the action scenes in the film. The only real flaw was two characters, I guess I'll call them ""Officer"" and ""Fighter"" since they weren't given real names, which came in really late in the movie and added nothing to the plot (well, except for explain how the hero got a huge gun for five minutes). Cut them out and it was a perfectly good action-horror movie.I highly recommend this movie.",negative
"....and what do we have? Highlander on acid...Wow what a kenetic actioner....For two hours I was excited and laughing my fool head off as this film has one hell of a sense of humor....However the plot is such that you often have to take your own thing from the film...""SPOILERS"" possibly...The film starts in the past at sometime near the end of the time of the samurai....as a swordsman squares off against an immortal who can control the dead....All victims of the Yakuza they rise up from the earth....A samurai witnesses the slaughter of the swordsman and then he himself challenges the immortal....Flash forward to the present...as the epic battle of good vs. evil comes full circle.....I am a Highlander fan and that's what took from this film speculation on how the immortals could be ""Born""....666 temporal portals all over the world...The forest of Ressurection was only one....Take note Highlander fans this isn't even part of the series we all love but makers of versus none the less show us how cool Highlander could be with a cool hero, and a great story with sense of imagination not dollor signs.....PROS-NONSTOP ACTION.....SOME GREAT IMMORTAL COMBAT....SWORDFIGHTS...ZOMBIES WITH GUNS AND THE ABILITY TO USE THEM.....BREAKNECK PACING...A SENSEOF HUMOR....CONS-NONE COMES TO MINDA truely great movie and I think that the film makers should be commended as great films are hard to find nowadays.....",positive
"When I picked up this movie, I was expecting some really cheesy and cheap action flick. In some ways it is, but in this case it's in the good way. The way the characters interact is where the real fun is. Perhaps more could have been made of the two 'guards', but the time they did fill the screen were hilarious moments. The facial expressions of the actors are something special too (especially during the fight-scenes). They know their fighting-arts, but these little additions made it really stand out.The fight scenes are good, and plenty. Guts are flying around. Even an attempt is made to tell a story (something along the lines of 'the sides of good and evil always changing'). It slightly resembles the feel of 'six string samurai' (but really only slightly).I can recommend this movie above any crap that Hollywood produces nowadays.",positive
"despite my initial first thoughts, this movie turned out to be one that topped my favorites list. its basically an attempt at a stylish action movie, and manages to keep the audience intrigued all the way through. first things first though. if your looking for a movie with incredible special effects and amazing sets, this is not the right movie for you. this movie was made on what seems like a very small budget, which makes me appreciate it more. the cast made this movie for fun, and it shows! there is a huge amount of dark comedy in the movie. the crazy little screaming guy was hilarious! the cool, calm short haired assassin was also really funny, and her fight scenes were competition to trinity (the matrix. the yakuza leader with the knives was funny too...in small doses. the main villain was much cooler that most movie characters and the plot twists were great. its a movie that you have to appreciate for what they managed to create with such a low budget.",positive
"OK, if you are a fan of Hollywood, theres no reason to ever watch this movie.  You just wont get it at all.  If, however, you can quite happily sit through a film and go along for the ride, this may be for you.It could be argued it tries too hard.  It could be argued that it is over the top.  It could also be argued that there is far too much fighting. My own argument is that all the above combine to create a great entertaining film.  I really enjoyed the filming styles, showing what can be created on an extremely low budget.  The effects are really not that bad.  One slight downer is the length, but you can get over that.At times you will say ""cool"", other times you will say ""damn"" and at other times you will laugh out loud.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone with similar tastes.",positive
"If this is the first movie by Ryuhei Kitamura we are in for a ride when he gets some real bling. If you have never seen a Japanese or HK movie before, go back and start somewhere else, you are in way over your head. This thing has flyin' zombies, vampires, kung fu, big guns, yakuza, swords, splatter, decapitations, disembowlements, some more kung fu, some more zombies, human sacrifice, bullet holes galore and lots of head shots, lots and lots of head shots. None of it is overtly cheesey, except the eat the heart thing. With few minor make-up cheats due to lack of budget this movie rivals the Matrix in cool. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of getting the DVD. I can't wait to see his next film Alive.",positive
"If you want a deep, thoughtful movie with plot and characterization, this movie isn't for you.  But if you want a fun time watching arguably the greatest bad movie of all time, you'll enjoy this immensely.  This is the movie I bet Hollywood execs would have loved to make, but can't with all its mindless comedy, gore, and blood.  This will live on as a cult classic and guilty pleasure.",negative
"What can I say? It's a specialist movie and in order to enjoy it you need to follow some simple guidelines. 1. Always watch foreign films in the language they were filmed in other wise they take on a whole new kind of ridiculousness.(this doesn't need any other kinds) 2. When the words zombie & porthole get used in the same sentence adjust your expectations finding realism in a movie is about as likely as finding Shakespeare in a comic book. 3. Expect a lot of gore take a sense of humour and have a good laugh. On the up side the makers of this film have made all the characters so unique making it incredibly easy to follow each character which isn't always the case in some Japanese films. Personally I loved some of the characters' they were funny, cool and oozed style. Plus it has one or two surprises up its sleeve.",negative
"Versus combines the fun of Asian pulp cinema with the gore expected of today's horror films with the action of an American summer blockbuster. This movie is fun enough to entertain a room full of skeptics, but gory enough to give a butcher nightmares.  The zombies are an outlandish mix of decomposing former Yakuza targets and freshly killed Yakuza thugs, and the protagonist and antagonist are reenacting a battle fought half a thousand years ago.  But the very best thing about this film:  THE ZOMBIES HAVE GUNS! You heard me right, GUN-TOTING ZOMBIES!  Of course, being zombies they're not particularly good with the guns, but that doesn't lessen the shiver of horror that goes up your spine when you think of the next undead shambling grave-rotten zombie rising to feast upon the brains of the living ARMED TO THE TEETH WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART FIREARMS!  This film gets my best rating, 9 thumbs way up.",negative
"The truth is this is a low budget movie with almost no story at all. The acting sucks but there isn't much acting, only fighting. 108 long minutes long. And there is only one location: the woods. The camera, the choreography are sometimes excellent. But I don't think that this is enough for a good movie. Don't let them fool you. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with The Matrix, Highlander,Crouching tiger hidden dragon and whatever other movies the commentators used for comparison. OK, they all have fighting scenes but that is all.If you are a hardcore martial arts fan than this should be your choice. If not forget this one !",negative
"I'm really not sure what was going on in the movie. Maybe there was something lost in the translation of the film????? First of all... were they vampires or zombies? Why the hell does the main character keep knocking out the girl every time he wants to fight a bad guy? Why did the zombies start coming out on the occasion? Why would you bury someone with a gun after you've killed them????? I was confused and bored. I turned it off with 30 min left. If i could sue the production company for the time i had wasted watching it, i'd be knocking on every ambulance chasers door!!! Finally... how the hell does this movie get on some of the 'top 25 zombie' movies list???",negative
"If you like Matrix, John Woo, Blade and Zombie movies than this one is something for you. Great fight scenes(with sword or without), cool shoot-outs, humor and a lot of gore. The only bad thing about it is that it is in Japanese with English subtitles. But there is not that much dialogue. 10 out of 10!!! Enjoy it!",positive
"Chances are if you watch this movie you will have made considerable effort to do so and are fully aware of what to expect, and you will not be disappointed.  I love the first hour and a half of this movie, but sadly the last half, although making an effort to keep your interest, fails mostly due to the fact that the climatic showdown with swords ends up being overedited and overlong.  Everything else you probably have heard about the hyperactivity of this movie is true though, and will not disappoint.",positive
"This is a great splatter flick out of Japan. I have given up on American cinema...I just can't seem to find anything that entertains me, especially gory movies. So I am left to peruse the foreign markets for my viewing enjoyment - and I am astonished at what I have found, including this little gem. This one has a little bit of everything - gore, zombies, John Woo style fighting, mystery & a touch (re: TOUCH) of romance - albeit a twisted sort of romance. Great camerawork & editing keeps the pace running, even when it seems to leave the viewer behind. The characters are great, especially since most seem to be overactors fresh off the casting couch. Basically, if you are into good B movies, you could do far worse than this.",positive
"if this contained more wanton sex and sexual related violence then this would have appeased my giant sexual appetite. however when a large sniper rifle was introduced to the equation, i reached for the tissues and the hot towel. this film contained more stereotypical Japanese metaphors than a bunch of business men from Tokyo in new york having sexual relations with high class prostitutes in a karaoke bar. and the lead bird was mingin'. the high point of this film comes when a man plunges his hand through another protagonists face.PS beating women is neither big nor clever, much like midgets with downs syndrome.all in all as about as exciting as a Trekkie's sex life.",negative
"Like so many others, I too heard of this movie thru various grapevines,and the reviews were always positive! So I went into this with about 11 other drunk or stoned metal/horror/gore/zombie/splatterfreaks, & walked out EXTREMELY pleased! Like the giant monster movies ala GAMERA/GODZILLA/RODAN/etc. the japanese continue to rampage the minds of americans with consistent great low budget filmaking, far superior to the regurgitated William Castle remakes,& ""I Know This Crappy Horror Flick that Comes Out Every Summer"" that Hollywood passes out! This movie is the perfect example of fun & over the top filmmaking that the Japanese create. A haunted forest filled with gangster/mobster zombies that can shoot guns, use knives,etc.! A movie that has elements ""Influenced"" by such films as:Evil Dead,Pulp Fiction,Sword of Doom,From Dusk Till Dawn,& the great italian zombie films of the 80s'. Filled with action,gun-fights galore,hand-to-hand combat, & lots or bloodshed, it's almost an overload. But comes out solid enough with TONS of cheesy acting/posing. I can't help but envision hollywood trying to remake this w/ Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves as the main character, & Benicio Del Toro as the gangster (Oh PLEASE don't!). So if you love over the top gore,action,& just enough melted cheese on the whole, this is for you my splatterfiends!",negative
"Somewhere in Japan is the Forest of Ressurection - where the dead have been coming back as zombies for centuries. In the present time, 2 escaped prisoners run into a group of thugs and a kidnapped girl. Bloodshed erupts, the dead rise, swords slice, guns shoot, and it appears that the one prisoner and the leader of the thugs have been battling for centuries in various forms, fighting to open a portal to the afterlife.I really wanted to like this movie, since the idea of a hard-core gore, sword-fighting, martial arts, gangster, hyperkinetic Japanese action/horror movie sounded like it couldn't miss. The movie delivers on blood and the action scenes are well-done and exciting. But things quickly get repetitive - uh oh, the heroes being attacked by ANOTHER zombie ... they're fighting... fight's over ... look, there's another zombie ... and so on and so on. This movie would have benefited from tightening up the running time and some character development so we actually care about the people we're watching. It's rather like watching someone else play a live-action version of a horror fighting video game for 2 hours. A little more information about the story would have made things more interesting as well, since the framework is there but not really used. There were some cute humorous bits (particularly with a running gag involving the hero knocking out the girl before every battle so she wouldn't get in the way). But overall, I was expecting to be blown away but ""Versus"" falls far short of that for me. But they don't really make many movies like this, so fans of zombie movies and action-horror will probably want to check it out to see for themselves. 5/10",negative
"Unpretentious is a good word to describe this movie.  If you want flesh eating zombies, gore, fantasy martial arts, explosions and shootouts, all slickly presented and delivered with a tongue in cheek sense of humour, and not too much story to get in the way of the action then this film delivers with a bloody splat.I saw this film on a double bill with Tetsuro Takeuchi's WILD ZERO, entitled Splat Japan!, and had the crowd cheering and applauding all the way through.",positive
"Another Japanese movie!!Another day of laughing!! This is a hilarious outing from the acclaimed director of the likes of :Alive,Asumi,Aragami(notice the first letter is always ""A"")Versus is absolutely hilarious,this is the first movie where the actors are always holding a gun(or a sword) talk like they are in some stupid big brother style show and when they decide to shoot or slash something , you have already fall asleep!!It must be cheap to shoot a movie in the woods,it seems that this director knows it well! A handful of characters , running , talking s**t . A matrix clone without script or new ideas ( hence the mortal kombat style logo )with a blair witch project twist(the woods)! The less we talk about the acting the better! Some people believe that Ryuhei Kitamura (the director???)is a talent! Enough with the supernatural , god fighting movies from Japan time to do something fresh!
Overall a dissapointing  1.5/10PS : Great extras on the DVD",negative
"Versus was one of the best movies ever made featuring great action sequences,gore effects,and a solid story.It featured a solid surprise ending and is in the same league as Evil Dead.Even if you are not a fan of anime(which I am)most will still love this film.Personally,this is one of the best films I have seen in all my life and that is a bold statement because I have seen thousands of films. I recommend Versus to anyone who wants a solid story,great special effects,awesome action sequences,and a great action film.The film also has great acting and some of the most memorable fight scenes ever in a film.Versus is similar to other low budget classics like Evil Dead and Dead Alive.The music as well is suited to the film is worth getting the soundtrack for.",negative
"It's okay.  A little to much winking at the camera. The jerks behind me wouldn't shut up.  I'm from Boston and we don't tolerate that stuff so I bumped into the guy on my way out while he was searching for his phone he dropped.  Then when I was in the parking lot I said to the back of his head, ""I hate nerds!""  It sounds aggressive but if you heard his laugh you would understand, and he laughed all the time, at every joke, practically every shot.  Jerk!",negative
"I so much enjoyed this movie even though I normally don't like the genre very much.This is a non animated Anime, the best I've ever seen and better than most of the animated ones. To enjoy it you cannot take anything in it seriously. I have no idea if that's the intention with it, but I surely hope so and I'm pretty sure I watched it as the director hoped I would.It's a hysterical, semi gory movie with no story to speak of. There is no depth whatsoever in the characters and the dialogue sucks. You'll see more silly poses and moves in this one than you ever saw in Matrix and the actors are more wooden than Keanu. Both the dialogue and the story is pretentious and would make you gag if you took it seriously.Yet I loved it! The funny thing is that all the things I normally can't stand in the typical Anime (ie Ninja Scrolls) (see above) is what makes me love this movie. I can't explain why, so watch it yourself and enjoy the craziness.",positive
"This movie walks proudly amidst the classics by John Woo, The Matrix, Blade and other stylish action movies. Although the plot is very simple, the variety of characters, the humor, the outstanding action and the subtle details are all there to cause this movie to stand apart from the rest. The imagery, angles and camera moves are well planned and superbly performed!",positive
"Wow! This was the first kung-fu/zombie/action-thriller/semi-horror/pitched gun battle/whoa-where'd that homoerotic moment come from? movie I have ever seen. And then the ending literally made me go ""Um-what?"" That has got to be one of the silliest endings I have ever seen. If the guy wants what he asks for, why the Hell doesn't he just go for it? And to thew people who say it's an action film and one shouldn't expect a plot. Well, no, if it doesn't have a plot then it's not a story. The plot elements of this movie, with the Forest of Resurrection being one of the 666 gates of Hell, the Yakuza being resurrected evil warriors, the heroine who couldn't string together enough sentences to just tell the Hero what the frac was going on, the cops who...Hell I have no idea what they were doing there, the zombies who - while numerous- were actually fairly easy to kill, and the villain with questionable dietary practices were a mixed bag of successful and unsuccessful. But the central battle between good and evil and the interesting notion of a hero who was changed in order to defeat evil is actually explored with surprising depth here. If you become more like evil in order to defeat it, are you so different that there is no discernible difference between you and does your victory become nullified? Is it even really a victory? It's a fun movie but not a great movie. I gave it five stars for the entertainment, for making me see that the philosophy was there, and for that hug which I in no way saw coming.",negative
"I would recomend any filmschool to use this film as a good example for the students. Perhaps the plot wasn't the best ever but the directing, acting and filming were at the limit of what this artform has to offer. It has cool oneliners that are for once filling out the storyline, something most hollywood movies often miss on. I congratulate the filmmakers on a job extremly well done.",positive
"Versus is a breathtaking cross of martial arts action and horror with a liberal dose of dark comedy thrown into the mix. The film features gunplay, sword fights and gore galore with the classic battle of good versus evil as the backdrop. A group of Yakuza meet mysteriously in the Forest of Resurrection where the dead are returning to life and a struggle for the ultimate power ensues. As a piece of stylish violence this film works brilliantly and the lack of substance goes unnoticed as hugely entertaining fights occur in quick succession. If you like your action slick and your zombies bloody then watch Versus and give yourself a treat.Please, Mr Kitamura,forget about Lupin and do the sequel!!!",positive
Theres not much to say that havent been said about this movie so i´ll just say that this movie BLOWS away anything Hollywood have ever done. Matrix with its budget of millons isent even close to the greatness that is VERSUS!!,positive
"Mere words cannot describe the pure excellence of this movie.A Japanese martial arts action/horror film, Versus makes your spine tingle and your belly shake.  Really, the plot is secondary.  You just need to note the following keywords: Martial Arts, Zombies, Gangsters, Comedy, and Huge Guns.Sure, it's POSSIBLE for a film with such elements to suck.  It's POSSIBLE. But it DOESN'T.  This film was described in the following fashion: ""It's like someone saw The Matrix and thought 'this movie's great! But it needs more ZOMBIES!'.Better than Citizen Kane, folks! BETTER THAN CITIZEN KANE!",positive
"Right in the middle of the film I was thinking... if ever I made a movie it would be a zombie one. I've been watching a lot of them recently and knowing full well that it's usually low-budgeted and cheesy, the dark humour is just amazing! Let me just say that I enjoyed the movie to the fullest! From the acting to the direction and I was especially impressed by the cinematography, solely on the reason that with such a low budget movie it looks absolutely brilliant. If you want plot... why on earth would you be looking for it in a zombie movie? All we want to see are a group of people blowing the heads off the undead anyway! The martial arts was impressive, the action astounding. I highly recommend this movie if you like @$$-kicking zombie flicks! (^_^)d",positive
"This movie was a lot of fun.  If you are into over-the-top zombie cheese, this is your movie.  Versus goes across genres, incorporating everything from martial arts to bullet ballet to twisted comedy.  So long as you don't take the movie too seriously, you should have a blast watching it!",positive
"What's with all the actor bashing in these posts? If you have any knowledge whatsoever of Hongkong/New Japanese action cinema you'd KNOW the acting's pitch-perfect in Versus. The movie's a bit long. Otherwise, what more could you ask for? And for Pete's sake don't watch it dubbed.",negative
"I had heard about the film Versus when it was region 2 and fell in love with the idea of it.  I went out and bought it asap.  I give this film a 10 not because it was epic, or overly dramatic, or had great special FX like American films, but because of the type of production it was.  I gained a great respect right off when i heard that the film was shot mostly with one camera.  After watching an interview with Kitamura i was also inspired to make films like this of my own someday.  The directing was great.  The picture was incredible considering what they had to work with.  I personally thought the action was breath-taking.  Every kind of fighting from mass amounts of shooting, to knives, swords, bare fists and kicks.  Even some super natural powers (nothing cheesy).  And on top of all of that, there's an awesome soundtrack that perfectly compliments the film.  I just can't get enough of this film!!!  It's definitely one of my top 5 favorites.  Check it out.",positive
"This film really is the best of anime brought to life.The plot is a bit light on.. but then so is the premise. Two men fight over the gateway to hell, the girl is the key... but who is the bad guy. So, check your mind at the door and enjoy the ride.A very clever film, using great camera work and colouring on a limited effects budget, to bring this film (back) to life. Starts in feudal Japan - sword fights with Zombies. Jump to present day, where gangsters are picking up 2 escapees.(Read their uniforms carefully) Bring on the zombies, an endless supply of guns and ammo (from the back of the trouser belt - really amazing). Add 2 slightly (maybe a bit more) insane cops and of course the BIG boss and we have set the stage for the action to begin. Not a film for the feint of heart, but is definitely a future cult film for the collection.",negative

"If you go into this movie with any sort of expectation for cinematic quality, I guarantee you will be disappointed. Don't think about the plot, don't read into any context, don't watch for character arcs, DON'T sit down with this with the assumption you're about to watch something with a theme that's any deeper than ""How many zombies can one guy kill with an inexhaustible supply of ammo and a gigantic samurai sword?"".My suggestion: Round up a bunch of hotblooded action flick fans, add booze, and get ready for one hell of a fun time. Also, GET THE UNCUT VERSION.",negative
"Maybe this isn't a perfect movie, but sure it is REALLY funny. A horror comedy that couldn't be filmed outside Japan. Extremely violent, extremely ironic.

"Actually i didn´t understand the plot even i saw the film in my language. there was this forest and all those zombies and yakuzas or yakuza-zombies or whatever and some cops as well and they were killing each other off. great fighting scenes, all-kinds-of-weapons-used-non-stop-killing...hell yeah!!!! don´t expect good acting or a real story though. Funniest splatter since Jackson´s Braindead! 10 points",positive
"""Versus"" is could be the best action film ever made. On the surface it appears to be a simple gore fest of a movie but like any film that is truly great it has a wonderful plot behind that is unique to the action genre.This film is quite obviously done on a small budget but don't let this put you off. You soon get carried away with the story. The acting is well delivered and very charismatic. But the plot is what marks this film out while the action genre tends to reside with its clean cut, happy ending. This film blows this conception out of the water, with a ending that can only be described as similar ""Donnie Darko"". You piece to together what you saw and build your own interpretation on the ending. But like Donnie Darko you're left with a feeling of not everything is clear yet it doesn't matter because you've just seen something amazing. This is certainly Keat's negative capability in motion.10/10",positive
"This Made in Japan film is a great action-pack! It has some good special effects, groovy music, gun fights, sword fights and lot of a violence!! People are blown up to pieces, cut by half, etc.!!

"Ok lets start off by saying that you may have seen some reviews of this movie on this site saying this film is a piece of crap.well those who think this had no business watching the film in the first place.1. The film is called versus(which suggests to any person with a brain that theres a conflict).2.there is a guy on the cover with a gun and sword(again,conflict)3. all shots of the movie on the back cover feature blood,guns and swords.So what the hell were some of these people doing moaning that the film lacked plot or characterisation. ITS AN ACTION FILM!!! Go watch a drama if you want drama but dont insult an action film for having too much action(its meant to fools).So you understand this film is an action/horror movie well read on.There are 666 portals to the other side in the world the forest this movie is set in is the 444th the forest of ressurection!. Basically the main character has escaped from prison and is to meet some gangsters in the forest who will help him,but then zombies attack him the gangsters and theyre female hostage(who has a secret).then the gangsters mysterious boss turns up and even more hell breaks loose. The whole portal thing is basically this films excuse for zombies,just like Romero's When theres no more room in hell the dead shall walk the earth.no further explanation needed. This film may lack characterisation but it doesnt lack characters.the petrified guy with the buck teeth.The main gangster henchman with the knives and green shirt all giggles and tongue waving arrogance.the two stupid cops.the laid back hero.the charasmatic main villian.this movie will give everyone a favourite character or moment.it even takes the piss out of matrix near the end without using bullet time.This film is basically a 2 hour highlight reel,get some like minded friends in ,some beers,snacks and enjoy.the martial arts is good too a lot of it looking more toned down than you would imagine(not much wire fu).YOU will spend every 2 minutes saying ewwwww,cool,wow.The opening shot of this movie says it all really.Drama is over rated anyway.Oh yes and as for those who say this rips of the look of the matrix(black jackets slow mo etc)Matrix ripped most of that off from eastern cinema anyway so stop moaning.Plus this is at least better than the last two matrix combined(the plot dragged those movies down-see). So i know this has been a long read but i had to first tell u not to watch if you are the kind of person who likes twenty minute segments of dialogue.But if you want a stunning evening of unpretentious FUN and gore and martial arts then BUY THIS!!!!",negative
"Really, what more can you ask for in a movie. Begining to end, blood and bullets, throw in Samurai swords and martial arts...hell yeah. The story really isn't as important as you never really know what either side is fighting for or why. The ending kicks azz and leaves you satisfied. If you like cult kick azz movies, then I recommend this one! 10 out of 10",positive
"I dunno why I find it so hard to appreciate movies with mindless plots, but somehow I find myself quite accepting some action movies like Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, Once Upon a Time in China, and Drunken Master. So perhaps it has got something to do with the fact that I liked foreign action movies better than those coming out from the states, that's why I decided to try Versus and right here I can conclude that, fastidious I may be, I really don't like this movie, to a greater extent than most James Bond flicks (which I find hard to appreciate in the first place)Here are some (but perhaps not limited to) factors as to why I don't like the movie:1.) The characters: The movie is full of anime/action movie stereotypes: obsessive villains, egotistic comic relief, coward villain, girls that kick ass, the girl who knows something, the wacko freak who's got a problem with getting people to like their facial expression (the same character type is also present in The Returners), cold blooded sidekicks of the main antagonist, the all powerful villain you name it, and it is probably found in this movie. Worst of all, though is the main character, which gives us the 2nd factor. 2.) The main character: He tries to be cool, but I find him very irritating. His voice is wimpy yet he tries to be bad-ass. His reactions are so slow, and the way he treats the girl is so unmanly at all. Throughout the movie the director tries to convince that indeed the main character should be the one the audience have to be rooting for somehow he failed to convince me I could've cared less had any of the villains started to gut him. And need I mention that he doesn't hold a candle to Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Keanu Reeves or Pierce Brosnan, in terms of being cool? 3.) Lack of names: I do not claim to have watched too many movies, but not giving any real names to any character at all just becomes very ridiculous. 4.) The music: truly horrible, and that's coming from someone who saw the more wannabe but somehow much enjoyable The Returners. The music obviously comes from someone who tries to imitate Matrix techno tunes, yet being lazy in doing so. I can write the same kind of music in my sleep. 5.) The forest: it's not that I do not like to watch a low budget movie, but considering all the factors above shouldn't the setting at least be a redeeming factor? Unfortunately, wherein Blair Witch project's forest setting inspires, this one drags. Why? Because it only looked like an indefinite forest. And anybody ever wondered why there are no caves, no animals, no flowers, nothing but trees and cliffs present in this forest? Maybe it's got something to do with the Resurrection Portal, but no part of the movie explained that. 6.) Reincarnation: I do believe in reincarnation, but what I fail to understand is why the villain is so obsessed with killing the prisoner punk wannabe. Sure, he and the girl would hold the power to open a portal to another world, but so what? Reincarnation, too, isn't actually such a simple matter of having a past life similar to that of the present (most of the time it isn't) Next time when movies about reincarnation is to made, make sure the scriptwriter understand more about reincarnation first. 7.) Surreal elements: It is always a great risk for action movies to use surreal elements. People most often want the scenes to be as believable as possible. Yet I find myself accepting the all the flying present in Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon. So why not this one? Simple: because the effects that support the surreal elements are pathetic.It is all too apparent that I don't like the movie at all, judging from the way I wrote the review. Had the movie been shorter and given a better soundtrack (even just the soundtrack) I would have been more forgiving. However, the movie just drags because there isn't too much motivation present in this movie. How about the lousy main character for a start?",negative
"I rented Versus last night on a whim. The box art was interesting and the synopses on the back was interesting enough for family video to earn my dollar. Wow was I wrong.First off I have watch my fair share of kung-fu movies and anime so I do understand the genre. I see this movie has garnered it's self a 7 out of 10 at the time of my posting, my humble opinion puts it at about 2 out of 10. First off the acting was a little off, facial expressions to exaggerated being the worst. The man in the green shirts performance personifies this complaint. The story left a lot to be desired, i.e. the random appearance of the two police officers(at least i think thats what they were), of wich was personified a lot of anti American stereotypes. The man covered in blood with the vaguely linkin park hairstyle and the women with the martial arts skill popping in and out, also the zombie element was never completely explained to my liking, also a lot of the special effects were not on par with most movies with a 2000 release. I understand the movies was made on a shoestring budget and these thing are to be expected, but I have seen movies do a lot more with less.I think a lot of people think that just because it comes from Japan it rocks. I think that needs to be reconsidered. If this was a American release it would have faired far worse on the rating scale.",negative
A hyperkinetic tour de force of a zombie film.  I saw it on the Tartan Asia Extreme label which is proving to be a source of consistantly high quality modern asian films.  As is becoming standard the asian directors have taken the action horror genre and propelled it beyond anything the west has produced. A great film.,positive
"WATCH THE UNRATED VERSION - YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID - I'M NOT KIDDING I'm so sorry for those of you who did not see it in the theater, for one thing because movies are cooler that way, and for another because even the super-special unrated two disc version is edited to make the film shorter. Which is sort of okay, because at certain points the movie can drag on and on and become throughly uninteresting, in between very cool gun and kung fu scenes.  That's the problem with this movie: between the VERY cool action parts there is endless ""what's going on in this forest who are you who am i"" fluff. we get the point, now splatter a zombie or kung fu a gangster. It's uninteresting when the audience knows the basic plot but the characters don't; besides the movie is obviously about the super cool shooting kung fu massacre scenes, of which there are too few. Also they really skimped on the samurai flashback scenes; those could, no, should have been awesome, but the fights lasted ten seconds. I should stress that there isn't enough action only because what action there is is SO COOL THE WHOLE MOVIE SHOULD BE ONE LONG FIGHT. To sum up this movie: watch it for the pretty good amount of gore, the usually excellent kung fu/gun/swordplay, the over the top ""cool"" acting, and the sometimes hilarious jokes. And watch the unrated version or you're a fool. The rated R version is piteously wimpy, I could not stand it. I highly recommend this imperfect but effin cool movie to anyone interested in gore, guns, samurais, gangsters, zombies, kung fu, and a few good laughs.",negative
"If you can push aside the over-dramatized blood and gore scenes that are in many Asian films, Versus is a great film for anyone into continuous action. The plot isn't all there at first, but will become evident more towards the climax of the action. The movie also has an impressive music score and some really beautiful filming locations... not to mention that the actors aren't too bad looking!",positive
"Before you dismiss me as just a random basher, I think it generally didn't live up to the hype. How that hype surrounded the movie; I have no idea. I don't ask for much out of a movie, and I'm very easy to please, but I couldn't buy into the 'Evil Zombie Demons' and their millenniums of alternating terror after a while. What I will give the movie is that the fighting's choreography was eye-pleasing. However, it's becoming a necessity to add a -plot- to these types of things. You know? Scratch that. I'll give 'Versus' The benefit of the doubt, and say that the plot was original and well thought out. That still leaves the actors I couldn't call anything but 'overdone', especially the man in the green suit who kept his mouth contorted in a scowl for the better of five minutes while he continuously blurted things that screamed "" The Writer's of this movie didn't ever consider toning my role down!""I've said my piece. I really give this flick a 5.5, the .5 being for the zombies, which I liked, and the fights. I'd love to see another director take a shot at this movie's plot, which could have gone better!",negative
"This movie is awesome. It was the first out of many Japanese movies that i have seen, and it is the best. If you like your shoot em up movies, and don't mind a little cheesiness (it really makes the movie better) that u will love Versus. I never saw this movie before i bought it. I was afraid to buy it cuz i wasn't sure if it was good....but i don't regret it one bit. U wont have any troubles finding it either, and you either have a special edition version or directors cut to choose from. I loved this movie to death and i hope everyone will go check it out. Monsters, guns, swords, and a badass hero...need i say more?Enough bout what i think lets get to the plot.Two men escape from jail to find out that there pick up men are hired to keep them alive, even though u can tell they don't. THey start fighting and this is where everything goes haywire. People start dying and coming back to life, due to the magic forest. Once the movie gets going, it is a whole lot of forget the plot its gun time. Then the interesting plot starts up again. To hear the rest u need to go see the movie.",positive
"OK, so if all the other film lovers out there are like me, they will know that buying a film purely because the picture on the case looks cool very rarely turns out to be a sound investment. So imagine my surprise after doing just that with this modern classic of an action movie! It was the result of a spare £20 gift voucher that was left over after a somewhat average birthday, but Versus more than made amends.However, this was not a sprawling epic to match the likes of Akira Kurasowa's 'The Seven Samurai' or a masterpiece of modern film making, such as Takeshi Kitano's 'Hana-bi' (if you haven't seen this watch it), it was just a brilliant low budget action/horror/comedy/science fiction/historical/martial arts (i could go on)romp, which does not disappoint! Although i have given it a 9 in my heart it will always be a ten and i urge everyone in the world to buy this film immediately. Its worth every penny of the £20 you'll pay!!!!!!! Don't wait for a voucher like i did, buy it now!!!!!!",positive
"If you like material art, swords, guns and a lot of gore (like in Evil Dead or Braindead)you will enjoy this movie. The Story is quite simple, but satisfying. The fighting optics are really brilliant, and the acting is really good (if you've seen the Japanese original, dubbed versions sucks!). This is really a splatter for the new millennium, with a good amount of black humor, and a kind of a drive that American pictures don't have.",positive
"This film is one of my favourite films, and definitely one of the funniest i have ever seen.The acting in it, and the storyline, are all top notch.But if your expecting something serious, then you shouldn't, because to be honest it will only be a let down in that sense. The storyline is very good, and i guess it sticks to it well.The fighting scenes are excellent, as well as the situations the hero is put in.If you want to see an Asian film, watch this, its up there with the greats, such as ichi the killer. :)",positive
"This is one of the most stupid movies i've seen, but it's fun. It is obvious when you see it that you shouldn't take this stuff seriously, so don't expect a real plot. The acting is bad, everything looks fake, but the character's attitude are funny and the fights are really delirious sometimes. It looks like they are making fun of manga heroes and though i like mangas very much, i had fun and i'd say it's worth seeing. Quite an unique movie.",positive
"This film has changed my outlook on what a good acction film should be....It is absolutely amazing. The action sequences were insane, the direction was excellent, and the gore effects were astonishing!!! The film is basically a hero's quest fighting a war against the Yakuza, zombies, and undead warriors!!! It's hard to find right now but if you have an opertunity to get your hands on it do so at all cost!!!! BEST ACTION FILM EVER HANDS DOWN IN MY BOOK!!!! ADAM WINGARD",negative
"If you like action your going to love this movie, at least i do. Good action, good fights, good swordplay with nice choreography and cool characters.",positive
"I had been looking forward to watching this for a long while now, and although it didn't quite meet the stupidly high expectations that I had heaped upon this movie, it did have some truly cool moments.  At 119 minutes, the movie IS a bit too long and some characters were kinda pointless, but all in all this movie marks a memorable if not entirely original debut for director Ryuhei Kitamura, let's see what his next film Alive is going to be like....",negative
"i was a little cautious when i watched this movie, but i am glad i did. it was deliciously low budget and camp, not to be taken seriously, but the action sequences were great. i loved the samurai sword fight and the take on matrix style without od-ing it. i thought the soundtrack was great and suited the scenes. and the ending was great- quite unexpected. the script did tend to be a little cheesy at times, but it added to the humour. admittedly, the special effects did let the movie down at times. it's a shame that some people took this movie too seriously- it's a fun movie- chill! highly recommended to anyone who can watch a movie without overly criticising it.",positive
"This was a very great film, and delivered just what i wanted and was expecting. the DP and the Director get mad props for this film, and beyond that, it was very entertaining, and good for a film student or some one wanting to see some zombie killin'10 stars.",positive
"what the hell is wrong with us white folk? why the hell is there no one making movies like this over here? huh? Versus is fan""freakin""tastic! i mean come on zombies with guns, yakuza, good vs. evil, kung-fu samurai action this movie has everything that i could ever want in a movie! has anyone watched it with director and cast comantary? most of the time the comantary licks ass in films, it's just a forum for hollywood fat cats to look like they know what there talkin about but with the comantary on this film these guys have fun. hell i would take this film over any zombie flick i have ever seen and that includes ""dead alive"" as well as dawn and day of the dead!",negative
"I think this movie is one of the best japanese action/comedy movies I've seen. Azumi made by the same director is also a great movie with great fighting scenes, but it is hard to compare given the difference in budgets. It didn't have a big budget witch kind of shows, but the fighting scenes are some of the best I've seen, It's fun to notice that in the knife fight, they did NOT speed up the action and they used real knifes (see the movie you will be impressed) in the end fight some of the elements was coordinated, but most of it was just the two actors improvising. The acting isn't really good in the beginning (hard to notice if you don't speak japanese) but it improves considerably as the movie progress.",negative
"I have seen a lot of martial arts movies and I am willing to put up with a certain lack of dialogue, bad acting, and poor plot but this movie is ridiculous.When I read that this movie has zombies, hand-to-hand combat, sword fighting and guns I thought to myself how could you screw up a movie like that. Well Versus does just that.The fighting is bad. The scenes are very choppy and it looks more like an American action fighting sequence then what I've come to expect from an Asian fighting sequence. Not only that, but the fight sequences had poor sound and visual effects. I get that this movie is suppose to be like an anime, but even then this would be a poor anime film. The shooting scenes are just as bad. It looked like the characters have never fired a gun in their life.The acting is just as bad. Again, since this is an action fighting movie I don't expect great acting but wow this was bad. To be fair, the lead character was okay, but everyone else looked as dangerous as Napoleon Dynamite. It is not believable to have 120 lbs nerds pretend to look badass. The dialogue was by far the worst. I watched the subtitled version and it seemed like the dialogue was written at a grade 1 level and was delivered at a level lower.I'm not even sure how to comment on the plot. It's easy to follow, but is just horrible. I think they were going for a Highlander movie plot, but if Highlander Endgame gets a 4.4/10 then this movie should be below that. By the end of the movie you really don't care what happens, which favours the ending because it barley makes sense; but by that point in the movie you are so tired of watching it you find yourself saying ""sure I guess that makes sense, just please end now."" Overall, I would not watch this movie again. In fact, I regret watching it in its entirety once. I don't know why it is rated so high, but this is by far the most overrated movie I have ever seen to date. I have seen independent films with a cast of nobody's and very low budgets produce decent movies so there so that is no excuse for this movie at all.",negative
"This is one of the films that you just have to see to believe, it has so much action that by the time it has finished you are left in disbelief. The action scenes are all top notch and has gained me as a loyal fan of the versus genre(due to the fact that I have not seen another film like this in my lifetime) so that is the greatest honour that I could give a film like versus is to create the Vurses genre.If you miss this film you have not seen a film and also if you don't watch films just because of subtitles or dubbing then you are missing out big time.After watching many Japanese and Chinese films this one picks you up, gives you a good slap kicks you in the balls, pulls your tongue out and pokes you in the eyes.other films to try are (all Japanese/Chinese originals) The Grugde or juon 1 - 4, The Ring trilogy, Into the mirror, The eye + more",positive
"There are many critics of this film that would jump at the chance to label it just another blood and guts zombie frag-fest, but in all honesty, there is much more going on here. It is clear from the beginning that everyone involved in the film's production was having an amazing time because they clearly made the film for that exact reason: The fun factor. If you're a fan of Japanese action films or zombie films or anything even remotely related to either of those genres, there's something here for you. I think the one quote from the crazy-ass-fighter-fake-cop really nails the point of this film: ""I have reflexes 500 times faster than Mike Tyson!"" This film does, in fact, have reflexes 500 times faster than Mike Tyson. The over-exaggerated staple elements of the film are what truly makes it shine: Martial Arts, Sword fights, quirky comedy, ZOMBIES. It thrives on the complete ridiculousness of the situation and what the characters are trying to do. The actions scenes are completely off the wall, with characters pulling weapons out of their back pockets like they were carrying armories on their backs. To a large extent, this film is a comedy, and if you miss that you won't enjoy the movie. The size of the weapons the Hero is wielding at the end of the film are testament enough to the insanity that is this film. The camera circles the fighters in the final sword fight for ages as an obvious hyperbole and joke that really just causes the audience to throw up their hands in a gesture that could only be interpreted as ""What am I watching?!"" The fact that the whole thing is delivered with a more or less straight face is what really puts it over the top to pure ""masterpiece-hood."" Overall, this film is not for everyone. If you have a twisted sense of humor and are deeply appreciative of zombie-films or hardcore Japanese action films, then this one is for you. A great romp through a fantastic world that never takes itself too seriously and delivers each punch and gunshot with the utmost of style and awesomeness. The only thing I am even slightly critical of is that it is never made clear who exactly is a reincarnation of who until the end of the film and then the TRUE ending confuses you even more - not to mention the fact that he has a laser sight on his katana, but that's another issue entirely... - but even that is a meaningless complaint when compared to this monolith to pure ridiculousness and action. Pick this up and enjoy the awesomeness that is Versus.",positive
"Where can I get the soundtrack play list or the soundtrack? This movie is so exciting to watch. It's a one of a kind blood bath, fighting samurai, shoot-em-up, gangster, zombie, good-versus-evil, cowboy, love story with lots of style. The action never stops from beginning to end. It's full of great gore and well shot scenes.The music is wild too. I can watch it over and over and it never gets old. The movie has terrific action all around. It's simply brilliant! Are they making another one to follow this one?I would hope so. I'd also like to find the sound track. If anyone knows where I can find it or if it can be posted please let me know. I've been looking for it for quite some time. If you like this movie, try Azumi.",positive
"This movie KICKS ASS!!!!!!! Cool, sexy cinematography provides a new perspective of a timeless plot to truly entertain. Versus is a sleek, wild ride. I loved it! Kill Bill meets Matrix meets Evil Dead; hot, fast, and most of all, fun. Caveat: This movie is not for the weak of mind, i.e., imagination. If you just ""don't get"" anime, or graphic novels, then you just won't ""get"" this film. You may have read the comment submitted by V4POR, my boyfriend. He watched the movie with me and won't stop going on about how terrible it was. He just doesn't ""get it."" Those of you who understand what I mean by that will really, really enjoy this movie!",positive
