"Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) works for a social services agency in Tokyo, although she's never seen any clients. When a new case comes in and they're short on staff, her boss has to send her out. Her first case is a doozy. When she enters the client's home, no one seems to be there, and the house is a mess. She hears scraping on a door--the old woman she is to care for is there, but in a semi-catatonic state. Soon after, she learns that there is much more wrong than bad housekeeping and a neglected old woman. There just may be threatening supernatural forces behind the scenes.This film is really the third in the Japanese Ju-On series. I won't usually watch a series out of order, but this is the only Ju-On film officially and thus easily available in the U.S. I was very anxious to watch the American remake, The Grudge (2004), and actually watched it the day before watching this film.The first 40-something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. It's also more episodic. Neither of those facts are negative here, and both lend to a somewhat easier understanding of the broader mythology behind the Ju-On ""monsters"", which is presented much more clearly in this film. However, the episodic nature also means that the viewer has to pay attention to the various characters and their names, or there is a good chance that one will get lost--this story touches on many different people, in many different scenarios. Occasionally, there are characters brought into each other's episodes, sometimes as subtly as a name mentioned in a news report. These cross-references, which can also slightly break the linear timeline, are effective if one is alert.There are things that writer/director Takashi Shimizu does better in this version, and things he does better in the American version. In this version, I loved the brutal opening sequence. Although it's somewhat present towards the end of the American version, it is much more effective here. I enjoyed the more traditional Japanese home--this film was shot on location in an actual house, whereas the American remake was shot on a house constructed on a soundstage. The Japanese house is more claustrophobic. On the other hand, the soundstage house was a bit grungier, which works nicely in the context of the remake. I liked this film's transition in the famous ""stair crawling"" scene (although I thought the flashbacks weren't necessary), and I also loved some of the more dissonant music here.The biggest differences occur after the first forty minutes, when Shimizu expands the number of monsters. The film seems to threaten a Romero-like plague that I'd like to see explored more in other Ju-On films (if that hasn't been done already).The bottom line though is that this is a nicely atmospheric horror film, with a creepy scene per minute. There were a couple very minor flaws--occasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one, but overall this is highly recommended. It earned a 9 out of 10 from me.",positive
"Although the word ""grudge"" doesn't quite fit the bill as part of the title of a horror film -- one thinks THE CURSE would have been more appropriate but such is the ""curse"" of translation -- JU ON holds up extremely well as a horror film. Built upon a notion that when someone dies victim of extreme rage, the emotions are left behind and this overpowering, negative emotion will kill anyone who comes into the house, JU ON first gives us a grainy montage at the start of the story of what seems to be a man killing away his entire family. This sets the events that come next, told in a non-linear way so as to disorient the viewer of what has happened/will happen like for example, why is the old lady seemingly living in squalor in this otherwise impersonal looking place, and what part does her most recent caretaker, Rika (Megumi Okina) have to play there?I've always believed that using subtly disturbing images instead of bringing the horror up front in a broad manner creates more of a punch for the viewer. Amping up the dread, even when the horror seems inevitable, creates a sensation of anguish because one knows that something is terribly out of kilter in this house. What director Shimizu does here with introducing the old lady in the unkempt house by having us see her hands weakly bang on the rice door, and then having her stare vacantly out to nowhere as Rika tries to clean up the place only to later meet the entities in the house, is unsettling as anything else that comes later. She whispers, mantra-like, something closely rendered to an ""I told you so"" and one only has to see the mounting horror in her old eyes to know something horrible is about to happen to her while Rika witnesses this and faints in horror. It doesn't matter that one sees the little boy running around and then mutely screaming in that cat-like shriek, or the shadow and croak of someone even worse... it's the inexorability in which this curse comes forth and attacks this old, defenseless lady, and then each person who has come/will come in contact with it, and when it becomes clear that the curse is not bound only to the haunted house but is in fact a growing web of death, the rug gets neatly pulled out from the viewer's feet, because safe becomes only a word and something wicked this way comes.This is a film that people will love or hate. I don't think there will be an in-between feeling. The way that these ghosts manifest themselves as if they were part of the living, leaving hand-prints and footprints behind, the way that horror draws itself on screen -- in barely there suggestions like when Rika is wheel-chairing an elderly man who is making faces; we see the one second reflection on a glass door of Toshio, the malevolent boy --, the way the actors react to fear which is anti-Hollywood, the non-use of swelling music but the use of eerie sounds, this is one very spooky film which can stand aside some of the greatest ever filmed. Quiet yet intense, relying on atmosphere and dread, JU ON is very chilling, and very effective. This is the horror that is rarely done today.",positive
"""Ju-On, The Grudge"" is not an easy movie to find in America (or at least it wasn't when I first wrote this review) , and after hearing it hyped to the heavens in magazines such as Fangoria and Rue Morgue, and by word of mouth as well, I knew I had to see it. I finally tracked it down in LA and watched it the very first chance I got to do so. Ju-On is a chapter story about a haunted house in a Tokyo suburb. The film begins when an inexperienced social worker shows up at the house and comes face to face with the horror within. The story jumps around from past to present, its chapters focusing on one character at a time until it has come full circle. Everyone unwise enough to enter the cursed house winds up dead, the haunting spreading like a virus. It seems that a terrible murder once took place in this house and the rage surrounding the act of violence has spawned its own evil curse. To enter the house is to be immediately infected and the haunting follows people home, driving them to near madness before dragging them away, never to be seen again. Ju-On bears more than a passing resemblance to its popular predecessor ""Ringu"" and is nowhere near as frightening, but it's not a bad film by any means. Butchered mother-ghost Kayako is very Sadako-like, crawling around with her long black hair in her face and moving with unearthly jerkiness. Her blue-white face is quite startling with its huge staring eyes and occasional splashes of blood. Her ghost son, Toshio, is both sad and frightening, appearing both as a normal boy and a pale, wide-eyed ghost. Many of the films most frightening sequences feature the murdered woman Kayako: her head full of black hair peeking around a corner, her shadow moving down a corridor and filling a security camera, a head-on shot of her crawling through an attic at night with only the beam of a flashlight illuminating her. The sound effects are quite disturbing as well and the performances are convincingly well done.I wasn't as scared by this movie as had been promised I would be, but that's what happens when you buy into the hype. I was simply expecting too much, and I got a pretty good ghost story instead. Ju-On is good. It's not great, but it's a decent, straightforward ghost story with more than enough scary moments to please most horror fans. Ringu was scarier, but Ju-On is a noble effort. Like most Asian horror stories, it remains ambiguous and open-ended, leaving room for both a sequel and the chance for you to decide for yourself what the curse of The Grudge really is. 7 out of 10 stars.",positive
"In Japan, when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) is assigned to visit a family, she is cursed and chased by two revengeful fiends: Kayako, a woman brutally murdered by her husband and her son Toshio. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears. ""Ju-on: The Grudge"" is a very scary horror movie, based on a Japanese legend. In the beginning of the film, there is an explanation in this regard. When a person is killed in a violent way, his or her death generates a curse that will stay in the place where the crime took place. If another person visits the haunted place, he or she will be chased by the fiends till death generating another curse. In Western cultures, the fiend is generally trapped in a haunted house, and the person is safe and sound if he or she escapes from the place. This movie impresses because there is no bloody scene, only a tense psychological exploration of the inner fear of human beings for the unknown. The story is very simple and low paced, there are very few special effects, a great use of sound, no gore, but the creepy atmosphere is really frightening. Asiatic cinema proves again that in this moment their cinema is the number one in the horror genre. Unfortunately, the pretentious American industry of cinema insists in remaking and spoiling these Asian masterpieces. I saw ""Ju-on: The Grudge"" for the first time on 02 June 2006. Today, 23 March 2007, I have just watched it for the second time with the intention of seeing the Japanese sequel and I startled many times with this excellent horror movie. I recalled the whole story and now I am familiarized with this Japanese belief of the Ju-on, therefore the non-chronological screenplay got better and better than in the first time that I saw. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ju-On, O Grito"" (""Ju-On, The Scream"")",positive
"I like to think of myself as a grrrl who is able to handle a lot, when it comes to horror, though I have developed a preference for the more psychological kind...The kind that takes you by the throat and does not let go...I thought Ring (original) was indescribably scary, especially since I watched it alone, in the dark ,in a deserted house, AND ON VIDEO, these factors definitely added to my level of scariness...The end of that movie, was literally spinechilling and I found myself clutching the blankets and holding on for dear life when in THAT movie happened what happened when it did happen.Thought that was the scariest movie ever! Nothing could top it, right? Well I could not have been more wrong...How totally unprepared was I for what was about to come when I popped Ju-on(original version again), in the DVD-player...Ow my freakin'god, I was so scared through the whole film by the terrifying atmosphere throughout...And how about the sounds...When the ending came i was so scared I could hardly breathe, I had the imprints of my nails in the palms of my hands, and could not speak or move...The aftermath of the movie was me being SO scared I was too chicken to go to the loo...I checked my closets, and my blanket numerous times,and this went on for months... had nightmares too...and was totally afraid of the dark allover again...like when I was a kid or maybe even moreso...I have seen a lot, but this one is definitely the most scary,and I do not think I ever wanna see it again...",positive
"Regardless its very high ranking on the list of 'Incomprehensibly Overrated Asian Horror Flicks', ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" isn't an entirely bad little film at all and it certainly contains more genuinely spooky moments than any other Japanese horror films released in the last 15 years. The problem, however, is that these spooky moments are merely snapshots and isolated images whereas the film as a wholesome is disappointingly trite and virtually plot less. The synopsis of ""Ju-On"" is actually no more than one phrase: ""a family tragedy occurred in a house one day and the restless spirits of a murdered child and woman still dwell around"", period! The film is divided into EIGHT little chapters, all of them revolving on how a certain person (a social worker, a police officer, a schoolgirl....) comes in touch with the house and its ghostly residents and then...well...DIES! That's all, really. After approximately the third chapter, you've pretty much seen it all and you can start getting annoyed with the total lack of chronology, story-background and logic. What exactly are the intentions of these ghosts? Why can't they find peace? All this is seemly of no importance as long as every chapter ends with a creepy scene of the ghosts scaring another person to death. But it has to be said, it is very creepy!! The little boy-ghost has the eerie habit of appearing everywhere (really EVERYWHERE) just staring at you, whereas the woman-ghost produces the most disgusting but effectively disturbing sounds ever! ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" may not make the slightest bit of sense, but at least it will frighten you a couple of times. It sure is better than all the ""Ringu""-films, ""Dark Water"" and ""Phone"".",negative
"Unlike many of the ""reviews"" below, I'm not going to take cheap shots at those who might not like Ju-On.I will say, however, that any fan of supernatural horror owes it to themselves to decide on this one for themselves.I wholeheartedly agree with those who found this film almost uncomfortable to watch.  If you are one of those whom this film really gets to, it is an experience as powerful as Ringu, Dark Water or the Exorcist.  Scary, scary, stuff.",positive
"If you only love American cinema and hate everything not English, you'll hate it.If watching Ringu makes you feel that you somehow know a lot about foreign movies, you'll just sit and compare the two.  Which is too bad, because they're both great in their own right.On it's own, Ju-on is fantastic.  It boasts itself as a simple contained story without stretching on into some sort of epic.  Where some movies will say: ""We've got a weaved story that's real creepy"", Ju-on seems to say: ""You came to watch a ghost story, and that's what you're getting.  Now sit there as we shove your heart through your butt-hoop.""Folks, if you have issues with dead stares and good use of dark angles and sound, it's extremely creepy.Studios aren't giving Sam Raimi millions of dollars to re-make this film in Japan alongside its original director for nothing.  If not my word, take their's.  The only reason this film got noticed in the first place is because of its original two-part TV airings in Japan that created such a buzz, they re-shot it for film.-- Or maybe you'll take the advice of people who've watched too many brainless popcorn summer movies and never watch it.  Ju-on's an Excellent flick.",positive
"Following in the immensely successful footsteps of RING, JU-ON: THE GRUDGE is an influential, creepy and utterly disturbing low-key ghost story from Japan, successful enough to spawn both a sequel and an American remake. This is Japanese horror at its finest: shot on a minuscule budget, utilising real-life 'run down' locations, and with a cast of subtle actors and actresses fleshing out the roles. Director Takashi Shimizu seems to have cast only deeply attractive actresses in his movie, perhaps to keep the attention of his male audience, and this makes the slow-burning proceedings very easy to watch.The 'haunted house' storyline is very straightforward and there isn't much of a plot to speak of: basically, we see a series of interconnected stories showing how a series of characters are haunted. There are a couple of ghosts; one is a cute little boy, whose manifestation mixes fear and pathos; the other is a more traditional female spirit with long, dark hair and staring eyes, the sort who inhabits every Asian horror film since the similar ghost in RING proved so successful. JU-ON: THE GRUDGE dwells on scares and shocks all the way through, which is why it's so effective: it's 100% focused on scaring the viewer. There are many great bits, my favourites including the duvet shocker, the television breakdown, the bloody staircase set-piece at the climax, and the bit with the three dead schoolgirls. There's even time for a twist ending for those who like that sort of thing. For unsettling, deep-rooted frights and genuine creepiness throughout, JU-ON: THE GRUDGE comes up trumps and will be hard to surpass.",positive
"I saw the American remake before seeing ""Ju On"" and had mixed feelings about it. After seeing this original Japanese film, I can't really say that it is much better. Actually, I'd even say that the remake was more effective in terms of atmosphere. This original has the better story, and the audience isn't slapped in the face with a stupid ""root"" as they are in ""The Grudge"" (although, maybe that is fleshed out in the other ""Ju On"" movies, which I have not seen). The chronology play was interesting and fresh, but this is so important to the director, then there should have been more inclusion of time indicators. After awhile, the movie gets really boring--different people being haunted and attacked by the same ghosts in the same way, over and over again. I realize this is the point of the movie, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining time. My Rating: 6/10.",negative
"Rika is a care worker for the social services. Its her first assignment by herself. Her duties is to look after an involute woman who doesn't speak. Even before Rika enters the house she doesn't feel right. The house is a mess, the rest of the family is missing with the woman left alone. Soon Rika finds a boy locked in a room; Toshio. But there is a more malevolent force in this house, that is consuming all how come into contact.Ju-On is an interesting twist on the haunted house genre. With the multi-linear story line, we see how the people who have come into contact with the force surrounding this house have meet their fate. The atmosphere is eerie and foreboding, but its over all not scary. There are moments that your skin crawls; but it doesn't keep it at a constant pace. The multiple story lines does become redundant after awhile. They should have focused more upon only a few people and flesh out their story, instead of adding story line upon story line. They don't even add much information to the overall story.I think the problem i had with this is that i got stuck in the cultural translation. At times the mythology went over my head, not understanding a lot of the significance that the story holds. Janpanese ghost stories are so different from western styles, so it takes awhile to understand the difference between the two. Janpanese ghost stories are more about the mood, while the American ghost stories are more about the scare.Though it went flat during the middle, its still an interesting watch and help change your view on ghost stories.",negative
"''It is said in Japan that when someone dies in extreme sorrow or rage, the emotion remains and can leave a stain upon that place. Death becomes a part of that place, killing everything it touches. Once it sees you, it never lets go.''This explanation makes our movie starts. First we see Rika, a volunteer social worker charged for an older lady named Tokunaga Sachie. Rika sees Sachie alone in the house, and to make things worst, the house is a complete mess. When Rika is cleaning the house, she starts hearing noises that come from the bedroom closet, and opening the closet, she finds Toshio. Toshio is a young boy that Rika recognizes from a photo she saw in the house. Finding everything very strange, she calls the welfare center to report the incident, and just a little after, she is attacked by a black shadow with two big eyes. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house, is murdered or eventually disappears. Different characters , different moments and different years are shown through the movie.I watched ''Ju-on: The Grudge'' almost three years ago,recommended by a friend who told me the movie was very scary. I watched it and I found it even more scary then I would imagine it to be! I told my father to watch the movie, and he liked as well. I just discovered recently, that this movie is the third from the Japanese Ju-on series. (I am looking forward to watch the other ones.) Definitely the Japanese version of this movie is MUCH better and frightening then the American version, not to mention that is the original version. The atmosphere and music of this movie definitely helps in make you feel even more scary; that's one thing I love in Japanese horror movies: they make you feel frightened without special effects or monsters. It's all psychological and using the imagination of the viewer.This is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, and for sure made me stay scared for more then just 2 days.Totally recommended for horror movies fans!",positive
"I got this film from a friend who bought it (and its sequel) on holiday in Malaysia.I'm not a horror fan, in fact I pretty much hate horror films because they are never scary, just cheap with gore thrown in to make up for the lack of legitimate scares. Despite this I enjoyed Ringu (and hated the sequel) so I watched this. The story is about a haunted house in Tokyo in where every visitor ends up dead or goes missing at the hands of a creepy white ghost kid and its mother (also a ghost). The appearances of these ghosts stem from a family who lived in the house until the father killed his wife and their child. Now the house is cursed and any one who goes in ends up dead.The story is chapter based much like Pulp Fiction and tells the story of each character who enters the house. This works well for the first 45 minutes of the film. Each character meets a creepy demise and you get a spooky feeling from just watching these characters that appear to be safe nowhere from the two ghosts. Unfortunately the last 45 minutes see the chapters become nothing more than disjointed and confusing. The final chapter is so surreal its ridiculous and makes no sense. To say this film loses its way is an understatement.The story is left open ended and while some may argue that this is to allow the viewer to interpret what has happened I say it is due to the writer and directors inability to wrap up what could have been on of the best ghost stories ever made.In the films defence the ghosts of Toshio and his mother are very unnerving, especially Toshio, considering they are just people painted white. Toshio has these big black eyes and remains silent throughout the film. Put simply he just looks plain weird, appearing from out of nowhere to scare the character out of their wits. Films never scare me but for some reason every time the kid was on the screen I felt cold shivers. The film is probably worth watching for this feeling alone and the first 45 minutes are excellent although ultimately you'll be disappointed with the ending. The sequel is better but strangely loses its way at more or less the same point in the film as the first and ends in much the same manner. It just gives more of an 'ending' that the first film lacks.",negative
"this movie is a horror masterpiece, id seen the two American grudge movies first, and they impressed me, but somebody told me that the original was even scarier i had to check it out. the first time i tried to watch it on my own i turned it off after ten minutes because i was that freaked out, and i didn't even really see anything. but the movie has a very haunting and creepy atmosphere that grabs you, even though i had seen the remakes first, it took nothing away from this horror masterpiece. there are a couple of cgi shots here, but for the most part, the scares are very classic, and some moments in this, are scarily haunting, and stick with you. bottom line is you want a brilliant, scary horror movie, this is for you, i highly recommend",positive
"Well? Everyone raved over this film like they raved over Ringu, so I should've known better. But I never learn. Ringu was a failure because of its complete lack of imagination and its degeneration into an endless, pointless detective story, which meant that when resolution finally came it was all explained away and any impact was totally dissipated. Well they didn't make the same mistakes in Ju-On?well except for the lack of imagination. But along with that, they made an entire no swath of mistakes! A Ju-On is a type of curse, a spirit of vengeance that haunts a place when the spirit has died in the midst of a great rage. Whoever comes into contact with the Ju-On, will be destroyed by it. Thus we have a house, and we have various stories of people who come into contact with the house that contains the Ju-On. This should have been horrifying and freaky and disturbing, but at every turn, they succeeded in diminishing it to nothing. For a starters, we never get to know ANY of the characters, we meet them, and 5 minutes later they are being terrorised by the spirits. They are less than two dimensional characters, and I am not able to just accept dumb bad character writing like most idiot viewers. The key to making your audience feel fear and anxiety is to get them involved in the characters. They get an F for that one. Because of its fragmented style, the narrative is totally about the spirits and the evil they perform. Thus there is no actual plot, which should allow for some great horror sequences and very little boredom. But after you've seen the first 4 incidents, you realise that they are all exactly the same with little to nor variation and thus you sit bored for the rest of the film waiting to see if they do something interesting. The one time they do actually try something different, it makes to little sense and doesn't seem to be from the same film and involves a character who you never ever found out what happened to him, thus making it irritating and very much not interesting. So there is no imagination in the horror sequences, they get an F for that one too. And oh wow, look , it moves back and forth in time? so you don't actually really know what is going on half the time and have to stop and try and figure it all out, which, in a film that is meant to be a continuous driving horror fest, is not a good thing. It adds very little to the film and increases the irritation factor. They are remaking this one for the western world as I type. I believe that this one could actually be improved by Hollywood, as they will enforce certain narrative aspects and imaginative big budget horror sequences, which while not necessarily the best kind of horror, is a hell of a lot better than any of the trash that occurs in this version.",negative
"At some of my kid's birthday parties there have been twenty or thirty children running around in poorly applied body/face paint and I've not once been driven hysterical with fear. And there have got to be at least thirty phones at the office where I work—twice that amount if you include mobiles—but I've never filled my pants when they've rung (thank heavens!).If, like me, you are not in the least bit perturbed by small, pale boys with black paint around their eyes or a telephone's ring-tone, then don't be surprised if you find Ju-on: The Grudge more than just a little disappointing. Frights are limited to the aforementioned phone-calls and the little lad popping up unexpectedly, plus the occasional appearance of his equally un-scary mother who croaks like a frog whilst crawling very slowly downstairs on her belly.Perhaps, to a Japanese person well versed in the Ju-on legend, all this might seem like seriously scary stuff, but I was bored rigid, with matters made even more irksome by the film's excruciatingly slow pace and a pointless fractured time-line that ensured maximum confusion. Quite what Sam Raimi saw in this to make him want to fund a remake I'll never know...",negative
"I watched the American version of ""The Grudge"" with Sarah Michelle Gellar some years ago and liked it a lot. Today I got a chance to see the Japanese original. Even though I saw it second and it doesn't have the same production value as the American version, I still liked it.""Ju-On"" bucked the trend a bit that you see with just about every movie dealing with hauntings or poltergeists; they jumped to level ten with the ghosts. 99% of horror movies involving a specter start off very slowly like the ghost is working up the nerve to fully scare the victim. In ""Ju-On,"" because there are multiple victims, the tortured soul wastes no time. You have to appreciate a ghost who wants to get things done promptly.",positive
"With obvious homages to Ring, The Grudge could be accused of an element of plagiarism. That doesn't, however, detract from the fact it's a pretty decent picture, and one of the better Tartan Asia Extreme movies.First things first - I *love* Ring, and of course, I mean the Japanese original. That film is by far and away the greatest horror flick ever devised and goes above and beyond what I ever expected a movie to do. However, it also instigated a ready conveyor belt of substandard imitators from the same shores ready to cash in on this unique success. Dire nonsense like the hollow Dark Water, the dull and over stylised Eye, the truly pitiful Phone and the slightly bizarre Audition haven't truly come close to the level of Ring.Now, while Grudge isn't quite up there with the very best horror films, as far as these Asian efforts go, it's definitely one of the more effective selections.Megumi Okina is Rika, a volunteer homehelper. On being assigned to a family whose regular assistant is temporarily unavailable, she encounters the mother of the family who seems unresponsive. However, after a disturbing incident at the family home, Rika finds herself seemingly haunted by some kind of entity and everyone who gets involved in the case seems to endure the same trauma.It's a slightly convoluted story to explain, but it works pretty well on screen. As usual the Japanese acting is generally pretty bland, but a few loud screams certainly add colour.The main 'bad guy' seems to be some type of ghostly being, and while it doesn't utterly terrify, it definitely brings a few chills. The only real problem is we see too much of it, and not enough is left to our imagination ala Ring. This takes away a certain air mystery and fear. Moreover, the fact the entity resembles the symbolic Japanese girl with long black hair we've come to expect in the likes of Ring and Dark Water slightly detracts from notions of originality.However, this is redeemed by some pretty effective direction and camera-work, which aid to promote certain wrongness about what is going on.Perhaps a few aspects don't altogether make complete sense, but there's enough style here to paper over such cracks.Movies like this do go to show that when it comes to horror, the Far East have a handle over the Western world.It's by no means the most brilliant horror I've ever seen, but it's definitely not bad and if you're up for a chill or 2, you could do far worse.",negative
"~Spoiler~ Takashi Shimizu's Ju-on: The Grudge was the second huge hit that started the J-horror wave behind Ringu. And while this film does have some creepy moments, I think Ringu is a better film. I will also not win any friends with this comment: Shimizu's ""American"" remakes were much better films. Ju-on is a haunted house story. A mother and son were killed in the house and a powerful curse befalls anyone unlucky enough to enter the house. That's the story in a nutshell but it's a bit more confusing than that. This film suffers from a fractured timeline that makes the story hard to follow at times. It's told in a series of vignettes that aren't in chronological order. It does come together at the end, but making it there is quite an effort. If you ask me if you should watch Ju-on before the remake my answer is no. The remake utilizes many of the same scares, but to a much better effect and if you've seen them already their power is diminished. In effect, I see this movie as a workprint for the remake and Shimizu could fully realize his vision after having made this film. Shimizu is a hit or miss director with me, but I'm always willing to see what he's coming up with next.",negative
"This movie is only scary if you are kind of person who jumps at there one shadow. This is not scary. This movie is badly written. Badly acted. Good special effects. But what an awful ending. This movie is pooh pooh. Pooh pooh, pooh pooh. Don't see this movie. It is a waste of time and money. This is a bad movie. Bad movie bad movie bad movie bad movie. This story of man who kills his cat, kills his wife, kills his son. And then they ghost just decide to kill every one. Stupid not scary. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. Save your money and don't see this movie. Awful awful awful awful awful awful. If you want to scared see Dracula (1931).",negative
"Yeah. True horror is an overrated/over-hyped Japanese flick in which a naked little boy covered in talcum powder runs around a house and his true moment of terror is when he bulges his eyes and makes a very loud ""Mroooooooooooowwww!!!!!!"" sound effect. Oh my god, it was so scary, I had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital for a heart transplant.OK let's be serious now. I, like many and their dog, saw this before its American counterpart was released. I was hoping I was going to be in for a good ghost story, when instead I was in for a movie about people being scared by the aforementioned naked talcum powder drenched kid and some girl with bad hair who makes some belching noise to threaten her victims. Who'd have known people were so easily scared?There isn't much of a plot to speak of, except people go in a house and die by these two ""ghosts"". There was one scary part, and that was when the woman got pulled under the sheets, but that was done way better (and not so cheaply) in its American remake. The film's atmosphere sucks too- why is everything so light??? The American remake is an improvement as you can see they achieved the scares the original didn't. Way better creepy/brooding atmosphere, more convincing ghost story, etc. Save your money on this dreck.",negative
"First of all, before you watch this film, watch the katasumi and 44444444 shorts and the 2 ju-on the curse films released previously. I was pretty mad because I thought this was the first movie. Why can't people number their films instead of only adding cliche subtitles? At least the previous films are not very long in duration. Another fact that pisses me off here, is the non-linear plot. Movies should stop trying to be the next pulp-fiction and writers should just stick with chronological order. I mean, there is a girl that visits his brother, he locks her outside because he saw kayako, he dies and then the police find his body. In the next segment we see the girl phone calling her brother and in the beginning I thought this was before her visit to the brother's house but then she is killed by Kayako in her own apartment before visiting her brother. So which scene happened first? I don't understand. Did they forget to edit the film or just tried to make it into an anthology with no connection. I hate moments like that. Next, the characters are pretty bland, I mean they are a lot but the closest one I tend to be interested in is the police officer who investigated the Kayako case formerly but still he hasn't got any interesting dialogue and his encounter with the classgirl vision in the film confused me a lot. His death is also disappointing and also isn't explained. He just appears in a scene with his daughter and just passed away like that. The horror is decent though if you are horror film starter. Kayako and her son are some of the most disturbing characters in horror history and her rattle will haunt you.",negative
"The movie unfolds following different connected stories in a non-linear timeline. ""Ju-on: The curse of one who dies in the grip of powerful rage. It gathers and takes effect in the places that the person was alive. Those who encounter it die, and a new curse is born.""The non-linear telling leaves the movie in a disjointed flow and it does not allow any tension to build up. The acting is subpar to fair. The creepy kid and the growling sound is the only compelling aspect of the movie. The initial introduction of the kid is rather underwhelming. It doesn't help that it's in daylight in a non-interesting way. There isn't anything particularly scary in this movie.",negative
"Before the film started, I read some quotes from famous American directors praising the Grudge and calling it one of the most frightening films of all time. I was a little nervous about seeing it, but excited that it had gotten such positive attention from filmmakers. That moment before the film started was much more frightening than anything in the actual film. To be generous, I have to say that some of the attempts to scare the audience are innovative. Sadly, nothing here is scary. I had a really hard time caring and was confused by the disjointed and tangential structure of the film. Sometimes the lack of logic in a horror film can work it's benefit. Not the case here. Seeing this film reminded me of why I hate formulaic slasher films. sure, there are some interesting things here, but nothing really gells. I love Asian horror films in general, but this seemed slight compared to the films of Miike, Nakata, K. Kurosawa and the Pang brothers which are getting easier to find in neighborhood video stores.",negative
"I thought I'd check out this movie as it became available on DVD while its American remake, ""The Grudge"", was fresh in the theaters, and other reviewers had said that this movie was even scarier. Well, they must have been on LSD, because this movie was pathetic. I squirmed throughout the movie - not because I was scared, but because I was when-is-there-going-to-be-a-plot bored! The movie looked liked it was made on a budget of 12 yen. The ""evil spirits"" looked like actors who accidentally fell into a vat of Welches grape juice. At the intended ""scary"" moments, instead of reacting with ""Oh my God"", you end up thinking ""Oh, You've got to be joking"". If you liked The Ring, and thought this would be in the same vein (as I did), you will be very disappointed.",negative
"I don't know why all these people I know think that this is ""the scariest movie they've ever seen"" I saw it, and was totally bored by it. As several people have already reported, the acting is bad, there is no discernible plot, and we never have anything resembling closure. All we see is a man and woman who keep seeing appearances and disappearances of a dead, wet girl and a small naked kid. Whoop-ti-doo! That's it. Oh, and we keep hearing this stupid noise over and over again -- a noise that simply sounds like a person making guttural utterances with their throat. You never get to see what significance this sound has in the film. You never see what makes it or why. After the 20th time hearing it, and still not seeing anything scary accompanying it, you will like just start ignoring it, like I did.Then there is this bizarre ""hair torture"", which I think must be some kind of Japanese cultural thing, because I don't get it at all, even though I've watched lots of Asian cinema. What this hair-torture amounts to is seeing long, black hair, usually messy and unkempt, creeping around corners or stairs, as though the women to whom it belongs is just out of camera range, and we only see the hair. Does the hair act like a snake, and try to choke people? NO! Does it attack people and cut them or whip them? No! All it does it just creep down the stairs, AND NEVER DOES ANY HARM TO PEOPLE. Apparently the Japanese are horrified by dirty, unkempt hair. Whatever.Sure, the atmosphere is occasionally creepy, with earthy ambient sounds and such, but the film itself fails to creep or horrify. In the end, all we have is a disjointed, plot less, conclusion-less collection of scenes, with a naked boy and a dead wet girl. and a couple of people reacting to it all with expressions of fear, and screams. It's not the artsy, avant guard film that fans rave about. It's just a dull mess of a film that has fewer scares than the average Ed Wood film.Horror does not have to be gory. Horror does not have to have blood or gruesome makeup effects. For example, The Blair Witch Project had no gore or makeup, and managed a few good scares. This film only succeeds in being weird and incomprehensible. If unkempt hair and white-skinned wet girls scare you, then knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this boring, pretentious trash.",negative
I remember when the American version came out everyone was saying how trash it was and that the original was soo scary! They lied.I found it an enjoyable enough film but the story is unnecessarily convoluted. I did kind of wish it was scarier though!,negative
"For years I have being looking for a movie to scare me and nothing did until I saw Ju-on: The Grudge I knew it was going to be scary, I didn't think it would have scared me as much as it did.This movie scared the hell out me, It freaked me out for Two days after I saw this movie.I saw The American remake before this movie, The remake at the time I thought it was worth watching but when I saw this movie, I Could not believe that I thought the Remake was Worth watching!back to this movie there was one scene In this movie that really freaked me out, I could not sleep with light off after I Saw this (Small spoiler) the Girl wakes up in Middle of the night and see Toshio on the bed crying like a cat and then see Kayako bending over the bed to look at her. That is one of the most scariest scenes I have seen.This movie has some Great creepy scenes which it so much better then the one of scares you get in the remake!The acting great, the story is great it' scared me, it creep ed me out so much 10/10",positive
"I have recently seen this film and as a scary movie it is very solid. The plot is sometimes confusing but the shocks are genuine and will have you hiding under your sofa several times. The horror element relies on shocks and make-up effects as opposed to loads of gore and CGI (however there is a smattering of this). Defenitely one of the best Asian horror films since 'The Eye' and would be difficult to keep its authenticity if remade in America. The music is atmospheric, reminiscent of the Resident Evil Games and adds to the tension running through the film. I am still unsure to why the boy, mother and father haunt/kill anyone entering the house.....wasn't really explained very well but leave your critical reasoning aside when watching it and enjoy the production for what it is a roller-coaster ride of jumps and scares.",positive
"Well, what can i say, this movie is absolutely terrifying. this isn't a horror like Scream, this is a proper horror. Horror shouldn't be guts 'n gore, it should be psychological and it should strike your inner fears, and i must say. This film does.The director certainly knows how to scare people scary, as in the scenes: Where the woman has been chased from her work straight to a comfy doom on her bed. Kayako crawling down the stairs, staring into the camera (as if she is looking straight into you). ummmmmmmmmm about every scene, especially when Toshio and Kayako are on Kira's bed with her. *shudders*Well, to me, the scariest film i have seen. Yet the American version is good, it doesn't have as much OOMPH as Ju-On. Please do watch this, i highly recommend it. :) ^_^",positive
"After watching this film, i was breathless. Needless to say, too scared to go p***. Ju-on is a horror movie that stands out above other western horros. Not since The Ring (original Japanese version) has any other horror flicks cause so much tension and screams in theatres. The reason it is so much different from American horror films, is that it uses one-of-a-kind sound effects, and the now famous 'slow and silent' tempo that causes the eerie feel to the movie. Most horror movie goers prefer watching big-breasted blondes running around screaming at the top of her lungs, whilst a mad knife weilding man chases her. That's where the ratings fall. Japan has established itself for being the 'land of horror film'. And Ju-on is no exception in living up to the standard. Sam Raimi has remarked this film as scary. From a director of his calibre making such remarks to ASIAN films, you know there's something coming up. The movie is a sequence of short stories, all interrelated. Which makes it good as it keeps audiences trying to figure out what's going on, and at the same time scaring the sh*t out of them. The films starts out slow, and proceeds with the same rythym throughout. I cannot possibly describe the ""scream"" scenes, as it will largely spoil the fun of watching it. But one thing guranteed, GET READY.",positive
"This movie managed to create a VERY creepy atmosphere and was pretty terrifying to watch--much more so than the Japanese film RINGU (which, like Ju-on, was re-made into a very successful American film). And, the images are rather disturbing--so much that younger kids should definitely NOT watch the film. However, despite its R-rating, it has no nudity and the violence is somewhat tame. I could have easily seen this rated PG-13 instead and think it's okay for the average teen to view.Now as far as the plot goes, it's very muddled and lacks depth. So, if you sit and think about what you are watching, you may not like the movie as much. My recommendation is to just sit back and try not to think too much. And, for a creating a chilling atmosphere it's hard to beat this film. In many ways it reminds me of SUSPIRIA. Both were very chilling films whose plots were't exactly deep.",positive
"Well, I assume you like it like that. I could be wrong. Anyway, Ju-on didn't exactly meet my expectations, but was a hugely effective thriller, especially given it's financial limitations. Clearly shot on a shoestring budget, Director Takashi Shimizu gets as much as humanly possible out of what was available to spend. The movie plods along slowly and at some points comes off as a loosely connected series of freaky occurrences inside the house in question, but gradually the story comes into clearer perspective.Normally I really enjoy movies that take a while to build up, not that plod along, but that seem to move along at a slow pace and then suddenly you realize there was a lot more going on than you realized. That's the kind of thing that makes you want to watch a movie again. Not because you didn't get it, but because now you know that there has to be something that you missed. Ju-on is kind of like that.I have to admit that I found the pace a little slow at times, but was mostly put off by things like bad make-up and too much of that cheap special effect that's supposed to be scary, where people who are ghosts or zombies or something open their eyes really wide and don't move. On the other hand, I tried to remember the budget limitations, and I really think that the movie was effective for the amount of money that they had to make it.The Ring and Ringu are two of those kind of controversial movies, like The Blair Witch Project, that everyone either loved or hated. I loved all three of them, and was mostly comparing Ju-on to Ringu when I watched it, and I have to say that I liked Ringu better. Those Japanese just know how to make horror movies. The atmosphere in Ju-on was very effective and eerie throughout the movie, but Ringu and The Ring, to me, were just terrifying.Ju-on just didn't have the same depth of plot that Ringu did. It's essentially about a curse that inhabits a house and infects anyone that comes into contact with it. You can't run away, and once it gets you you're haunted by it forever. Like the budget, there's not a lot to work with there, but they turned it into a thriller that is, as they say, more than the sum of its parts.Note: my favorite special effect you couldn't even see, it was that creepy creaking sound that was heard anytime the shadow ghost was on screen. THAT is what's going to give you nightmares",positive
The film is based on an old Japanese which gives the film a certain authenticity it is an excellent horror and although there is no real ending this is because the film was originally made for Japanese viewers and they do not like a conventional ending to a film as the Americans and the British do. This is not because of the directors inability to write a proper ending. The ending is left to your imagination which i think is a good thing. The film involves many changes in time which gives the film an interesting feel and focuses more on the story than on the special effects like its American counterpart.,positive
"Ha! You wanna laugh? - This truly demented, little, Japanese, ghost story tells us (with total dead-seriousness) that a house (or dwelling) will automatically become cursed (with a haunting) if someone happens to die there in either a fit of hellish rage or in the despair of great sorrow.Oh, really!!?? - Well - If this is so, then, can you just imagine how many places (especially hospitals and senior's homes) that would be carrying curses right at this very moment?? Wow! If this was the case, then the total number of cursed places, worldwide, would truly be a staggering number. I'd say there'd probably be a cursed residence in just about every single neighbourhood, from here to eternity, and beyond.Anyways- With its story moving along at an absolute snail's pace, The Grudge (and its mega-cheap scares) was pretty awful horror, for the most part. I mean, it wasn't even a slightly interesting ghost story, if you ask me.As it turned out - More than anything else, my main effort while watching The Grudge was to actually stay focused enough in hopes of remaining fully-awake through the blasted thing.",negative
"There is a house in Tokyo where every visitor ends up dead. A child and a mother live there. Both are ghosts. Their presence stems from a traumatic event in the house's past. The story follows a variety of characters that enter this house.The film is structured into a series of short vignettes. We follow different people who encounter the horror of the mysterious house. To be honest, the plot only barely makes any sense. It seems to be no more than really an excuse to string together a number of scary moments. This is excusable on the grounds that this is a genuinely unsettling film. It's unnerving in that way that the best Japanese ghost movies are. The cultural difference between east and west means that these movies come at us in ways we can't predict as easily. The Grudge, like Ring, is no different in this respect and its scare factor stems quite a bit from this unknown quality. There is a constant atmosphere of dread in this one.If it perhaps had a little more coherence it would have the potential to reach the top bracket of horror. As it is, it works as an exercise in inventively scary Japanese horror moments. For me this is a perfectly acceptable compensation, as it's quite rare for any film to scare you in the way that this one sometimes does. So with that in mind, it's quite obvious that this movie has achieved something impressive.",positive
"And neither are half naked little kids sitting around fidgeting or rocking back and forth or--you guessed it--staring into a camera. Give me a break.I'm not saying it doesn't have its good parts. But for a film that has been so talked about and has such a reputation behind it, the original really was a disappointment.I can't believe I'm saying this but...watch the US version instead.",negative
"Yes, I have heard a lot about this movie but after I have seen it, I found out that it is not as creepy as in the trailer. But it is still worth a watch, since there's hardly any more new horror movie. So there is no reason why one should stick to the Hollywood Remake of Japanese horror. Watch the Original!. As least you got to see the different side of the horror movie; like how the low budget movie of Japanese turn out to be more scarier than the Hollywood horror movie. Max - 6/10",negative
"Horror films are so called because you would feel horror or fear during or after viewing such films. However, chills, sweats along the spine, dilated pupils, panting for air, screams, or open mouth are NOT products in viewing this film. I will forgive myself to view all two episodes if it is an 'experimental' film done by a student studying film making. Sitting on my chair watching these two movies, I have the hope that something would come up as a reward. Virtually nothing horrible comes up, and that makes the film 'horrible'.The so-called atmospheric horror in these two films (Grudge 1 and 2) is something like looking at a confined mad person. The evil spirits will kill everyone in contact and the population of evil spirits grow to no ends, and no purposes per se. Worse still, the first 30 minutes of Episode 2 is the EXACT COPY of the last 30 minutes of Episode 1. What is the rationale? (I am referring to the DVD versions)If you want real horror, refrain from spending valuable time to watch them at all. Don't take for granted that 70% of the people who quoted for 10 out of 10 is a good guide. I doubt these people never watched good horror films before. In all, there is no plot, a bunch of innocent people were killed eventually, no mention on how these people were killed, no reasons why they were killed, and there is no hint of any kind the Evil Almighty, if exists, to do with this kind of meaningless deed. Avoid to watch these films entirely is the best policy.",negative
"Yawn. The new wave of Asian horror is so boring that once you've seen one of them, you've seen the lot. The first Asian horror movie I ever saw was Ringu, and if I had stopped there I'd have missed nothing at all. It is, of course, too late now that I've seen at least ten of the damned things; but I'm hoping that someone will heed this warning before attempting to see Ringu's many rip-off's, or even that film itself. I actually went into this movie with some hope, as the Asian horror sub-genre's sister; the wave of American remakes, actually produced a decent take on this tale; but alas, it turns out that this is one of the few times that the remake is superior to the original. This film relies more on a creepy atmosphere than a story to deliver it's scares, and this is more than evident on several occasions as the story constantly gets put on the backburner, leaving us with a very muddled plot indeed. After announcing that when someone dies in a fit of rage, their spirit lays dormant; the film skips between various happenings in a rush that is far too swift to keep up with, making it very, very easy to get bored.A major thing I'm not impressed with when it comes to Japanese horror films is the effects on the ghosts. The ones in this movie are no better on the looks front than the norm, but they accompanied by a certain noise that does serve in being quite frightening. It's hardly a masterstroke on the director's part, but at least the film has a good point. The way that the story moves is really confusing. I noticed this with the remake too, but it's even worse here. We start off at one point, and suddenly we find ourselves somewhere else and it doesn't exactly make for an interesting watch when you can't tell what's happening. The film does look nice throughout, but this is a purely aesthetic point, and doesn't help it when it comes to the more important parts. Important parts, like characters, for example; and the ones here are paper thin, and impossible to care about. Much like the entire film. On the whole, I say don't bother with this and just see the remake. You don't really need to see the remake either, of course; but if it's one or the other, take the other.",negative
"Ju-On: The Grudge (2003) *** (out of 4) Takashi Shimizu's horror classic(?) about vengeful spirits who kill whoever enters the house that they died in. I must admit that the film lost me early on and I could never catch up to what was going on but after reading a few message boards it appears this is something Japanese horror films try to do. I'm not sure if that's true or if those who said that just didn't understand the film either. Either way, the film does what it sets out to do and that's be very creepy. I'm not familiar with the Japanese horror films but after watching this I certainly plan on seeking more out. The key thing here was the direction, which was great throughout and he did a great job at building the suspense and playing it out at the right moment. I'm not sure if understanding the story would have made me enjoy the film anymore but the chills made it worthwhile.",negative
"Ju-on: The Grudge starts by informing us, the viewer that is, that 'Ju-on: A curse by someone who dies bearing a grudge'. Cut to a Japanese social welfare office where Mr Hirohashi (Chikara Ishikura) gives Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) a home visit to the Tokunaga's to check on an old lady named Sachie (Chikako Isomura). Once there Rika discovers Sachie living in filthy conditions so decides to clean the place up a bit but while cleaning a room she finds a young boy named Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) in a cupboard whom then disappears, things get even worse for Rika when she starts to see ghosts. She now has the curse of Ju-on just like anyone else who visits the Tokunaga's where terrible things happened in it's past & terrible things will happen in it's future...This Japanese production was written & directed by Takashi Shimizu & is another vastly overrated Asian horror film that so many people seem to love & think is brilliant, well I'm happy to say that not everyone think this way & as an avid horror film fan I didn't think that much of Ju-on: The Grudge besides some effective imagery. The script is an absolute mess & a confusing mess at that, now there is plenty of (wasted) web-space out there devoted to Ju-on: The Grudge's plot & attempts to put it all into context & explain it (just look at the message board for it on the IMDb, for example) but as far as I'm concerned life is too short to spend any amount of time trying to work this film out, quite simply there are better things to do with ones life then try to work this muddled mess of a film out. For a start there is virtually no story, nothing is explained other than what a 'Ju-on' is & for some bizarre reason it's not even in chronological order as the film is split into eight sections each one almost exactly the same as the previous plus it shifts backwards & forwards in time for no apparent reason other than to confuse & annoy. The plot is wafer thin & what little plot is here is muddled because of the unusual narrative, the character's are poor & the film is repetitive. To be fair to it this was the third film in a series which started with the straight-to-video Ju-on (2000), followed by Ju-on 2 (2000), then came this which was then followed by Ju-on: The Grudge 2 (2003) & finally the officially 'Announced' Ju-on: The Grudge 3 (2007) if it ever gets made. Maybe if you see the previous two films, which I haven't, Ju-on: The Grudge will make more sense, I doubt it though.Director Shimizu wrote the thing so he has to take some of the blame but to his credit he directs very well & Ju-on: The Grudge has an absolutely terrific atmosphere, I'd say it's probably one of the creepiest films I've seen in a long time & there are some very effective moments here, I wouldn't advise anyone easily scared to watch it alone. The ghosts are eerie & that sound they make that everyone mentions is also rather unnerving. Forget about any blood or gore, I don't think there's a single drop of blood in the entire film.Technically the film is OK, there's a certain minimalist & basic look to it as I think the filmmakers wanted it to be set in the 'real world' so they kept it simple. The special effects are decent & it's generally well made. I watched the original Japanese language version with English subs & everyone seemed to do OK although the performances were hard to judge.Ju-on: The Grudge is yet another overly complicated, confused muddled mess of an Asian horror film that definitely has atmosphere & some genuinely creepy images but when your so detached from a film, it's story & character's it's hard to get excited about. Remade by Hollywood as The Grudge (2004) & the sequel The Grudge 2 (2006) has recently been released & is currently topping the US box office as I write this, both were directed by Shimizu.",negative
"This is a comparative review based on the original Ju-On and the American remake. I am ashamed to say I saw the remake first but let me get one thing clear straight off I am a BIG fan of Asian horror - I love films like Ringu, Dark Water and Audition. I was saddened and disgusted by the pointless Ringu and Dark Water remakes, but I feel the American remake of this film is a whole lot better. I liked this film a lot because, basically, I love pretty much all things Japanese. It was a good ghost story with a nice dreamlike quality to it, but I'm afraid that's it. The remake scared me sh*tless where as this did nothing. The Grudge (remake) scared me so much it took me two weeks before I got it together to watch the second instalment (a little disappointing). The only thing that scared me about this film, was the last two seconds. In fact it was so unscary I'm not even sure if it was meant to be. The Americanised version has benefited greatly from the bigger budget it got. It looks beautiful where as this looks cheap and drab, the sound effects and make-up are better, and the scares are bigger. The plot was straightened out, it's a bit all over the place here but it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. This was a real disappointment, but Takashi Shimizu got it right the second time around. Thanks",negative
"'Ju-on: The Grudge' for me is the final nail in the coffin for the much hyped new Japanese horror resurgence of the last five years or so. Now there HAVE been some amazing movies coming out of Japan since the 1990s, even as far back as the 1980s, that deserve more than small but enthusiastic cult followings, especially many of those made by film makers like Takashi Miike, Shinya Tsuakamoto and Takashi Ishii. Most of their movies ('Fudoh: The New Generation', 'Tokyo Fist', 'Gonin', 'Ichi The Killer',etc.) are crime or exploitation and not strictly horror, but they are innovative and exciting and shocking and everything the mainstream claims 'Ringu' et al are. Why those movies haven't received half as much attention as 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ringu 0', 'Dark Water' and 'The Eye' (which isn't actually Japanese but is usually lumped in with the others mentioned) baffles me. The mainstream proclaims 'Ringu' and friends to be the greatest thing to hit horror in years. They are supposedly some the scariest movies you'll ever see and Hollywood is falling over itself to remake them with hot babes in the lead roles. Me, I just don't get it. I've watched hundreds of horror movies over the years, great ones, good ones and plain awful ones, so I think I have some appreciation for the genre, but I just don't see what the appeal of those movies are. Nonsensical story lines, two dimensional characters we don't give a hoot about, and lots of lame scares and second hand imagery (mainly derived from old Argento and David Lynch movies) doesn't exactly spell the future of horror for me I'm afraid. So anyway, 'Ju-on: The Grudge' is dished up to me with a ""no, this one is REALLY REALLY scary!"". I tried to watch it with an open mind, hoping that this time I will be impressed, but no, it's the same old tired bullshit. Ghost kids, schoolgirls with white face paint crawling around making funny noises, blah blah blah. Oh sorry, there were also cats and an old man playing peek-a-boo, I almost forgot. Man, give me a break! Some say that you have to have seen the previous movies in the 'Ju-on' series to really ""get it"", but frankly I don't care. I can't see how any amount of back story can save this jumbled, confusing mess. The bottom line is that it isn't frightening or disturbing it's just BORING and silly. The only grudge I care about is the one I'm going to hold against everybody who told me this was worth watching!",negative
"I never really enjoyed 'Ringu'. Two years worth of hype ruined it for me (it was either the hype, or the fact that is was a glorified detective mystery). Having only heard a a couple of negative reviews for the American version of 'The Grudge', I got to watch 'Ju-on: The Grudge' without any expectations, and I was quite impressed.'Ju-on' follows a story about a haunted house. After a violent murder took place at the house, a curse was born. All who enter the house are cursed by the Grudge, a curse from which there is no escape. Unlike the plot-heavy 'Ringu', 'Ju-on' is fairly light on plot. The story is broken up into chapters that seem to jump backwards and forwards through time. I thought this was an excellent way to tell the story and maintain suspense without revealing too much.Having seen not seen any good psychological horror movies recently, while watching stuff like 'Versus' and some of the Jason movies, it was a nice change of pace to watch a good suspenseful horror. 'Ju-on' defies some rather dubious production values, creating a creepy atmosphere and providing scares for any fan of intelligent horror movies.I enjoyed 'Ju-on: The Grudge'. I'm hoping I can get my hands on the original Japanese version sometime, and avoid certain disappointment by watching the American remake. I recommend this to any fan of horror movies, providing they can be patient with obvious cultural differences in story-telling, just don't watch it with anyone who is prone to talking during a movie - 9/10Final note: This may be the only time I have not used the word awesome in a review. Please understand, the lack of 'awesome' appearing in this review does not detract from the quality of the movie.",positive
"All I have to say is that there better be a total rewrite in the works for the American remake. I've seen better camera work from 12 year olds using mom's VHS camcorder and better special effects on the local news.It isn't scary except in the sense that there's a mostly naked little boy that runs around in horribly done white makeup. Maybe they'll make Sarah Michelle Gellar run around mostly naked in the American release.When we went to see this movie the theatre had up a sign explaining that this was the Japanese version, not the American remake. The sign alone made me take pause before purchasing my ticket, but we were already there. Seriously though, what does a warning like that say about the target audience of the movie?It's best left for rental or the dollar theatre, even if you're into big screen/THX eye/ear candy as you're not going to find it here.",negative
"JU-ON: The Grudge is one of the scariest films I've ever seen. It's not quite as effective as Ringu, Dark water or The Eye but what Ju-on lacks in editing and direction it makes up for in sheer unrelenting terror. It has some of the most horrific moments in cinematic history. Under the blanket, the shower, under the table, waking up, etc.  The moments sometimes don't amount to all that much and it's somewhat confusing but film creates an atmosphere of extreme dread supported by decent performances and a chill inducing score.  Compared to the others I realize it may seem a litlle amateurish but a little fine tuning never hurt anything. And they're currently preparing for american remake so you never know what the results may be. they certainly did an admirable job with The Ring.  The story focuses on a group of charachters as theyc ome in contact with Ju-on the prescence left over by a truly horrible act that occured. It than transforms into a curse and continues and gets worse with each person it comes in contact with. I'm not sure it truly makes that much sense but does it really matter. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It scares the hell out of you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"Actually, it's a sequel  a big-screen outing for the third installment in a straight-to-video franchise. It's possibly also the lamest, least original horror to yet emerge from the Japanese New Wave. If The Eye and Dark Water were two of the most buttock-yawning supernatural-shockers to ever crawl out of South East Asia, this rubbishy cash-in wouldn't qualify for a Rod Serling Night Gallery episode. The Grudge  it might as well have been called 'The Strop', or 'The Sulk', for all its impact  is the curse, created by a murdered mother and child, that kills those who enter their family home. Unfortunately, while the pacing and tension's completely kaput, the ghouls themselves are just laughably crap. These include Three Little Zombie Maids from School (in blue face-paint) and a saucer-eyed boy who 'meows' his victims to death. He also turns up in the most embarrassing places: in a victim's bed, emerging from another's blouse  or under restaurant tables (a scenario that gets middle-class parents bad reps, and on fellow diners nerves in parts of Islington). Someone should explain to Takashi that little boys really aren't very scary. Little girls, of course, are absolutely terrifying. That's why Stanley Kubrick used two of them in The Shining. For her part, Catboy's mother  a keening long-hair half-inched from 'Ringu', looks like nothing so much as Kate Bush in her Babooshka period, and makes similar noises.",negative
"This is one very creepy film, with a constantly menacing tone.Sadly though I would agree with many of the previous comments, the plot has far too many holes & inconsistencies.  Why were our original victims killed & why are they now angry ghosts seeking vengence against anyone who stumbles into their home?Horror films are renowned for their plotholes, but this just has too many for it's own good.Despite the lack of a coherent storyline, Ju-on: The Grudge succeeds where horror films need to, in the fright department.  Ju-on: The Grudge will keep you on the edge of your seat.Good horror from Japan, where the best horror of recent years has come from. 6/10",positive
"I saw ""The Grudge"" before seeing this, so I had a general idea of what to expect, but I did expect better. Everyone always says: ""The Japanese one was SOOO scary."" Umm... no, not really. The remake was more terrifying and that says something because the remake wasn't scary, just entertaining. I found ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" to be confusing and lame. The Japanese actors are.... strange. Like... whenever something moves or a strange noise is head, they completely blow it out of proportion. They start screaming and clutching on to their face like they are dying when they've only heard a strange noise. The only thing that was scarier about this movie was Toshio. He was creepy in this one and kind of dull in the remake. The dead woman was lame looking in this one. The lead character was not as eye-friendly as her friends or her American remake portrayer Sarah Michelle Gellar, yet that's what sets this movie apart: an unattractive female lead. My final rating: 5/10.",negative
When talking about the face of modern J-horror it either The Ring or Ju-on that came into people mind and as a fan of the original Ringu (1998) and the Americanize one all I hope for when I start watching Ju-on (2002) for the first time is a good main character and some intense supernatural encounter with eerie atmosphere and this movie deliver none of it. I may watch this movie in the wrong way when I watch it with another person in broad daylight but I doubt with how tedious and boring it is for 1h 30min watch it at night will change anything. The timeline in Ju-on jump anywhere and split into many segments and each one got it own main character but no segment or character stand out in my opinion because they all suck and fail to escape the curse except Takako Fuji who played the ghost Kayako because although she silent throughout the movie everytime she appear I know this movie about to come to an end,negative
"Many of the reviews on here are excellent and there's no need for me to restate what they've said already about this beautiful movie. I would like to add a little about the ending. Does contain spoilers, so beware.I was upset on seeing the Hollywood remake to see they'd simply latched onto the ""scary woman"" and turned her into a monster. The most unsettling part of this movie, for me, was the realisation in the end that she's no killing people - she's just pleading for help. It's her husband who's doing the killing. For her, the murder just keeps happening over and over, and Toshio has to watch it every time.The shift between fear and sympathy came as quite a jolt to me.",positive
"I saw the remake staring Sarah Michelle Gellar a few years ago and found it very creepy so when this version was on television I had to watch it to see how they compared. I'm not sure if it was because I'd already seen a version of the story or because I was ready to be scared but this time was was no where near as scared, it still provided a few hair raising moments though.The story opens with Rika, a young social worker being sent to a home where she finds an old woman, upon hearing a noise she looks upstairs and finds a cat in the cupboard as well as a small boy who she didn't notice at first, he says his name is Toshio. Before she can ask him anything else she hears a noise in the old woman's room and finds a strange shadow by the woman, it turns and looks at her leaving her terrified. What follows are a series of incidents each linked to the house some take place before Rika's story and others years afterwards, it appears that everybody who visits they finds themselves haunted by Toshio and the strange shadow and end up dead or missing.The episodic nature of the film seemed strange at first but there were subtle links between them such as mentioning the finding of Rika's body in one of the later chapters. Unlike a lot of horror films there is no gore and we don't actually see the victims die, the chills come from creating genuinely creepy situations, Toshio is particularly creepy even though he doesn't do anything more frightening than stare.",positive
"So I watched this as the first film and looked it up after I finished- this is the third film in the series. I didn't quite know what was happening and this may very well be because this is the third film in the series.Regardless, I don't need someone (or the film) to tell me the threads of story from previous films for me to rate my enjoyment. I thought this was entertaining but repetitive. I could see myself watching each part of the movie as a short film and finishing the film over a week or so.I loved the type of atmosphere this goes for, however there are quite a few horror cliches I didn't enjoy. Keep in mind though that this film came in the beginning of the 2000s, so the horror cliches weren't cliches just yet.I respect this film and think multiple viewings will only strengthen the positives of the film.First viewing: 6 out of 10",negative
"How come great directors have crappy movies as ""the scariest movie I've ever seen""? Why Peter Jackson said something good about ""Cabin Fever"" and now Sam Raimi do the same about this crap?""Ju-on - The Grudge"" is the most boring, non scaring, ""trying to sound scary but sounds like an Arne Nordheim playing in is sleep"" movie I've seen in a long time, at least since the dreadful ""Cabin Fever"". At least they have more in common with great directors praising their movies, both ""Ju-on : The Grudge"" and ""Cabin Fever"" are unbelievable dull, boring, stupid and without a single scare. Wanna be scared ? Just watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, the introduction alone is 1000 times more scary than these 2 crappy movies.Try ""Ringu"", ""Dark Water"" or ""The Eye"" instead of this crap (how and why its been made into an American movie is also unbelievable).Jonny Larsen",negative
"The story of Ju-on began as a TV movie, and was one of the creepiest films ever made. The second TV movie continued the story but was somewhat less than what came before.This is the first of two big screen adaptation, or should I say continuations of the TV films. You do not have to have seen the TV films to appreciate this since the film is fine on its own (although the Grudge of the title is explained there).The story of what was spawned when a family imploded violently is frightening to watch. Taken on its own its a scary film with jumps and starts and images that will remain with you long after the film has ended. This is a slowly traveling evil that moves from family to family and person to person killing or driving mad all who come in contact with it.It should be said that this is not your typical ""American"" horror film. There are no central characters outside of the house and the ghosts, characters are on stage because they simply become one more link in the line of evil. The style is non-western and so plays out in unexpected ways for the ""Anglo"" audience.If you like horror films give this a try. I don't think that you will be disappointed.8 out of 10",positive
"This is a supremely horrible movie! After being touted as the scariest movie ever made and Sam Raimi singing his praises, I was more than disappointed.
The least a horror movie could do is to at least make my heart pound a little faster but this movie is so bland from start to end. The director seems to think that by throwing in a story that does not make much sense and a few scenes of blue-skinned, black-eyed ghouls will instantly make it a horror classic.How wrong. A good horror movie not only relies on shock tactics but also on the build-up of tension. This movie sorely lacks both, making it blander than anything. The plot goes nowhere, the characters are just there to be killed off, and the horror scenes aren't really horror. The only thing that separates this from the average slasher flick is in place of a slasher, we get a long-haired ghoul who prefers to crawl instead of walk a la The Ring.Don't get me wrong, The Ring is a superb horror movie. It is just that Ju On uses all the old, tired tricks in the book that it is impossible to get scared anymore. This 'horror' movie puts Japanese horror movies to shame. Japanese horror movies had a revival recently with The Ring and Dark Water. I just hope that people would not judge all Japanese horror movies by this very badly done crap.",negative
"When Rika (Megumi Okina) is sent by the Welfare office to check on an elderly woman, she finds a bizarre situation in the woman's home. The woman is living in deplorable conditions, and appears to be in shock. The longer Rika stays to help out, the more odd things she uncovers. The creep-factor rises rather quickly, and Rika has no idea what she has stumbled into.So begins one of the best ghost stories to emerge from Japan in years. Like RINGU, JU-ON takes ordinary people, thrusts them into unfathomable, supernatural situations, and makes us watch as each person meets their unfortunate fate. JU-ON features a curse that is more like a trap for the unwary, rendering them helpless to do anything to save themselves from impending doom!An anthology film of sorts, JU-ON shows what happens to various people who enter the accursed abode. There is a certain gargling sound that will haunt your dreams! There's also a lurching trip down the stairs that is unforgettable, and every bit as effective as the ""TV scene"" in RINGU!Genuinely frightening throughout, this movie came out during the wave of Asian horror films that reshaped and revitalized the genre. It still stands among the few at the very top of the list. Recommended for anyone who loves an outstanding ghost story that truly chills the spine!... The sequel, JU-ON 2 is also highly recommended...",negative
"at first, I saw the title ""The grudge"" American kind, but never saw that yet. So then i went home investigating on that film, seeing if it's worth the watch. I also learned it was originally Japanese horror films. I looked into ""Ju On: the grudge"" and i was curious. I looked at some pictures to see how they were like. It was just so brilliantly scary.So then, I decided to rent it. Then i went to Blockbuster and saw the ""Ju On:The Grudge"". It was hard to find such thing here in Arizona. So, i rented it.I chose to watch it in the light so that i could not scary myself to death literally.As i watch this, it started scaring me from seeing the Grudge appearing from the bathroom stall, distorted face to zombie like friends of Izumi's to Kayako's bloodied body crawling down the stairs.Toshio is brilliantly scary kid. And Rika was a great actress for this. I say this film has the pure horror that does show what horror is really all about. Not some slasher films with half naked girls, that just ain't slightly scary. This film got me frightened pretty good. This film is the only kind that actually frightened me good. All horror films in America is either too crappy and lame or nauseating and sick.This movie deserves the compliments. And i compliment all Japanese folks for making this great film.",positive
"Following a series of strange deaths, a group of detectives learn they are linked to those who entered a house with a cursed history and race to stop the deaths from continuing.Overall this one was highly impressive at times and got some good points out of it. The biggest factor for this one is mainly from the scares, which are prevalent throughout here as it works through several impressive elements. As is usual for the Asian ghost genre, the majority of that comes from the quite creepy and definitely scary ghost popping up whenever you least expect it in areas that are quite shocking to see it come from, definitely giving this one a feeling of dread and terror that very few actually manage to accomplish at all yet this is utterly masterful at. There's moments within this one that are all about extreme jump-scares as the ghost appears long before actually interacting with the victim which sets off the scares quite well so scenes of the lone girl in the apartment being tormented by the ghostly doppelgangers of her friends, the showing of the brother and his wife who succumb to the curse and the reporter in the hotel room are all outstanding sequences that work very well because of where the ghost finally pops up and how creepy it is seeing this. When it decides to backtrack and focus more on the suspense of the slowly-approach ghost just utterly terrifying the victims, like the ambush on the security guard at her workplace, the first scenes showing her caring for the grandmother amid the ghost-boy and cat as well as the police detectives in the house during the crime scenes and finally the true meaning of the curse at the end where the hand-trick all-throughout the film finally gets explained, generates some rather creepy moments from time-to-time which causes this to definitely be worthy of its stellar reputation. There's also the generally demented ghostly-look for them throughout here, which is just unnervingly chilling and creepy that serves this one quite well. Unfortunately, it's also slightly problematic as there's a small-but-noticeable flaw here. The only real issue is that the film is plagued by a plot that's far too disjointed to make any sense as we constantly zip around to view the dozen or so different stories that are told within, making it nearly impossible to keep track of who's-who here and what time period we're in since this doesn't go chronologically with that either, and then because we learn so late in the film what's actually going on, it's far too late to really care. When it sticks to the ghosts, it's great stuff all around and is certainly highly enjoyable.Rated R: Violence, Language and themes of child abuse and violence.",positive
"Very well made horror and if it is influenced by, The Ring, it has much innovation of its own. I loved the use of sound and at times just these noises were scary in themselves. Also I loved the inclusion of the edge of something scurrying out of frame or a reverse zoom revealing a little something to surprise us. The ghosts were exceedingly well done. Their stilted movement was excellent and the reliance of white for skin colour and piercing eyes most effective. The film could be difficult to follow because we go back and forward in time as it would seem do the ghosts, but one tends to be swept along by the obvious emotion in the air and the sheer creepiness of the goings on. No graphic violence other than what are virtually stills establishing the raison d'etre for the whole film, but still very scary.",positive
"The plot (and almost everything else) of Ju-on is almost identical to that of the American remake, The Grudge. When one of the other social workers doesn't show-up for work, one of the newest workers goes to take his place. When the new social worker arrives at the house, she immediately realizes that something is not quite right. What she doesn't realize is that the house is possessed by spirits who will kill anyone they come into contact with.Comparisons between the Japanese Ju-on and the American The Grudge are inevitable. Overall, I'm one of the seemingly few who enjoyed the American version more than the original Japanese version. Maybe it's just because I watched The Grudge first, but I really think it goes a little deeper than that. As I mentioned previously, the plots are almost identical so there's really no point in trying to pick a favorite.Things I preferred about The Grudge - 1. Make-up - I found the more stylized make-up very effective. 2. Flow - As far as non-linear story's go, The Grudge is one of the best examples I've ever seen.Things I preferred about Ju-on - 1. Simplicity - The lack of a lot of extraneous details makes for a tighter movie. 2. Cast - The fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't in Ju-on is a big plus for me.Overall, while I may have preferred the American remake, the two movies are actually very close in my mind as far as vehicles of entertainment go.",positive
"Cryptic, puzzling & refusing to unfurl its mystery, Ju-On: The Grudge is an eerie yet utterly baffling horror that presents itself as an enigma, is told in non-chronological order, and keeps its audience clueless from beginning to end. Nothing more than a collection of six interrelated episodes, it isn't scary but only shocking in bits n pieces.The story of Ju-On: The Grudge revolves around a curse that was born in a house in Tokyo when a husband killed his entire family in a jealous rage after he suspected his wife of having an affair. The plot takes place over a number of years and follows people who, after visiting the cursed location, are marked & pursued by a vengeful spirit.Written & directed by Takashi Shimizu, the movie covers the origin of the curse during its opening moments and follows it up with six segments, each focusing on a character who comes in contact with the curse and inadvertently spreads it to other people & places. The segments are presented in random order but it all links up in the end.The house where the curse was born is revisited various times & by various characters throughout the movie but it ultimately becomes repetitive with no logical explanation in sight. The ending does provide some insight into what the curse is all about but there is still no answer to what the viewers are supposed to take from it or what exactly is the director's intent.On an overall scale, Ju-On: The Grudge makes efficient use of its available resources, maintains a fine grip on the genre elements, is unwilling to hand its viewers the key to solve its puzzle, and sustains its suspenseful ambiance till the very end. Those looking for a typical horror flick are bound to be disappointed but just like every film ever made, Ju-On: The Grudge will find its share of admirers.",negative
"A Japanese horror film part of an ongoing series. A mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.I cannot believe I've never seen this film until now, seeing as Asian horror is my thing! I haven't seen the two shorter films before this one, but it didn't feel like it was necessary anyway. I followed the story throughout, even with its non-linear storytelling. I love ghost story films and I really enjoyed this film! It's atmosphere was perfectly done and it was definitely giving me shivers down my spine at parts. It didn't need jumpscares, it had tension.The multiple story lines made the film so interesting! If it was just one character experiencing these terrifying hauntings happening it wouldn't of flowed so well. It felt really fast, which is good because too much tension can grow to be boring. The acting was all really well done as well! In the American remake (I know, we don't talk about it but I will anyway) it just didn't flow as well. The fact that it was Americanized with it's casting ruined it from the start, but this felt authentic. So I won't be checking out any of the American sequels, seeing as the original remake was lackluster.I also have no real drive to watch the sequels to this film, though I may watch them just out of curiosity if it's just the same story over and over again.",positive
"In Japan, when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina is assigned to visit a family, she is cursed and chased by two revengeful fiends: Kayako, a woman brutally murdered by her husband and her son Toshio. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears.Creepy moments, but I wasn't surprised due to watching the remake first. The weird yelching, the noises, the atmosphere didn't feel the same to me. Not to mention the storyline gets confusing, going off course in the second half.Bottom line. People who have not the remake first will undoubtedly get more out of this, than me. If you want some scares though, pick it up6/10",negative
"Yes, I agree much of this Japanese film about a family murder that took place in a suburban house in Tokyo has merit. It is decidedly stylish. Effectively creepy. Ubiquitously eerie. The acting is uniformly workmanlike and the actors(no pretenses here that I am familiar with any of them)do justice to the desires of the film and its director. That being said, I found the film to be very awkward in many paces. Lacking cohesion. Split-purposed and personalitied. The haunting history behind the house is nothing unique. You have seen it before many times. There is no real resolution to anything either. There are scenes that jump out at you. Some of them mask the real film and make it seem better than it really is - in effect this film about a string of episodic stories dealing with various people that come in contact with the house is a collection of very well-filmed creepy scenes with a pretty poor story at the core. I am surprised it spawned an American remake(well, I guess I'm not truly surprised) as well as sequels to boot. There were so many questions I had left unanswered that I just cannot find myself into lavishing more praise than that which I have given it. Ju-on is really quite derivative when it comes to it source material but saved to some extent by the style and manner in which it is executed. That being said I do not wish to see it again any time soon.",negative
"Ju-On (2003) was a grim ghost story caught on film. A family is brutally murdered by the father before he whacks himself after he's finished with his wife, son and the family cat. The movie follows several characters through out a ten year period. People come and go but the angry entity that resides in the house still remains. The negative entity is still restless as it has claimed scores of lives and ruin families. Despite the presence of the mother and her blue child and cat, the real evil spirit is Pop. Yes, Pop's one crazy guy who has the grudge on humanity. The kid and cat appear as a warning whilst the mother is just sad that her life has ended so tragically, she morns over the soon to be victims because they'll end up just like her. The monster that every one fears is Daddy.This movie was huge in it's native Japan. It started off as a made for video movie. The success of the video movie spun off into three theatrical releases and an American remake. I like the original as well as the remake. I have seen Ju-On several times and each time I see something new (i.e. images in reflections and mirrors). If you enjoyed the remake, you'll love the original.Highly recommended!",positive

But the movie is badly made, and it has no conclusion. All they have done is paint the cast white & red, and make them scream without reason, it is supposed to be a invisible-visible terror but seems to be more mental (pun intended). People were scared due to the helplessness of the victims to find a way to survive. Awfully made...",negative
"What gives this movie its power is its structure.It's not one linear adventure with the same network of characters, we get a collection of overlapping story lines in non-chronological order.This set up means that characters come and go and disappear and reappear again so anyone could get killed off at anytime. No one has plot armour. Admittedly we don't get as much time to develop a relationship with them but movies rarely give us this in the first place.Unfortunately the whole handling of the actual terror feels totally risible. Worth the ride though.I have not seen the remake but I hoped they kept the best stuff and lost the worst aspects of this movie.",positive
"I really thought that this would be better than the grudge (2004) since this came out first but hell nah. This is badly written, the acting makes me want to gouge my own eyes out, and the plot is complete trash. This is my first time saying this but watch the 2004 version instead.",negative
"2/10 stars because the director did effectively create a creepy mood-- and that's all! This film did not scare me. (The Ring and Ringu did) Ju-on is a perfect example of all mood and no story. I saw the trailer for Ju-on and was and still am really scared by the TRAILER; it looked really good. I had quite a surprise as I wasted my time with this film, because by the end there was no point made of all that had occurred. Don't waste yours. Examples of good similar movies: The Eye (Korean); The Ring; Ringu; and for multiple death movies in the spirit of Evil Dead 2, The Hazing. **SPOILERS***SPOILERS***Here's what happens in the movie: this is the entire excuse for a plot: An angry man murders his wife and son in their home, kills himself, and then their ghosts kill people who enter the house. Someone dies, then someone else dies, then someone else dies, more people die, and then the movie ends! Whoopee-- what a waste!",negative
"This film I actually saw pretty soon after seeing the American remake. I did the same thing with The Ring and Ringu. I will admit though, I didn't really care for this one and it was the out of order timeline that messed with it. That is something I've gotten over as I started to understand the movies in this series. The synopsis here though is a mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.We start off first learning about what a Ju-on is. Sometimes when someone dies a violent death, a curse is placed on the house that will follow anyone who enters. It then shifts to grainy looking footage. We see Takeo Saeki (Takashi Matsuyama) gnawing on his finger nails. There is blood on him. He grabs a cat violently. We then see him taping a picture back together. When he turns it around, the woman in it doesn't have a face as that part is still missing.The film doesn't follow a straight narrative and will jump around. It is told in six different chapters, each following a different character. The first chapter follows Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina). She is a volunteer at a Social Welfare Center. Hirohashi (Chikara Ishikura) is on the phone when she comes in, but breaks away to speak with her. He asks if she will be willing to go to a house to check on a client. The person that was assigned her took the key and then never came back. She reluctantly agrees, stating that she is just a volunteer.She goes inside to find the place is trashed. There is a window of a bedroom door where she sees something running their fingers over it. It is an elderly woman by the name of Ms. Sachie (Chikako Isomura). She doesn't talk much, but Rika gives her a sponge bath and then gets her to bed. She then cleans the rest of the place up. She makes a call to Hirohashi to tell him no one has come back yet. Hitomi Tokunaga (Misaki Itô) calls asking for her brother, Katsuya (Kanji Tsuda) as well as after their mother. Rika then goes upstairs to finish cleaning. In a bedroom she finds a closet door that is closed and taped shut. She hears a cat meowing and opens it up. There is a cat as well as a little boy locked inside. His name is Toshio (Yuya Ozeki).When she goes back down stairs, she sees Sachie laying down with a dark entity over her. It looks over at her and we see its eyes. The movie then gives us our story over the next 4 chapters, with the final one showing the truth behind everything. They follow Kazumi (Shuri Matsuda) who is married to Katsuya. What happens to his sister of Hitomi. There's a chapter where the police investigating what happened, one being Nakagawa Keiji (Hirokazu Inoue), and reaching out to the detective who was originally working the Saeki case. This detective is Yûji Tôyama (Yoji Tanaka) and the curse also involves his daughter. Her name is Izumi (Misa Uehara). With the final chapter taking the name of Kayako (Takako Fuji), Takeo's wife, and showing how all of this fits together.Now that is where I want to shift over to break down this movie. I've already said a bit about how I got confused the first time that I saw this movie due to the non-linear timeline. I still got confused this time around and I'm pretty sure this is like the 4th time I've seen it. There are some things that are bit fuzzy for me, but I'm going to try to break them down a bit.Something that I noticed for this version, as this is a bigger budget remake of the writer/director Takashi Shimizu's previous take of Ju-on: The Curse. That was more of a TV movie and it felt like that. This version doesn't give us why Takeo kills his wife. We know he went into a rage and wiped his whole family out. I'm not sure if Shimizu assumed that everyone seeing this saw that previous movie and that is the explanation, but I just know it is missing from this movie from what I gathered.Yûji was the detective as I said who was investigating the original crime. There wasn't a lot to look into, but whatever happened messed with him and he retires from the force. Now it appears when he is reached out to by Nakagawa, this is when Rika discovered what happened to Katsuya and Kazumi. This explains why the house is in disarray when she arrives. Where I get confused though is how Rika's friend of Mariko (Kayoko Shibata) could have Toshio as a student since she is a teacher. By the time this goes down, he should have already been dead. Aside from that, I get what they're doing and I think it is an interesting way to present all of this.I feel that this movie is also playing with time travel or at least using time as a flat circle. There is a moment where Yûji is trying to do something to the house and he sees his daughter as Izumi the teen. There's another moment where she sees her father as well in the house later on. This is kind of an interesting thing to play with her since both of them are touched by it and it ruining their lives as well.The last thing before I move to another aspect is that I think the curse is a bit loose here. It does follow some of the people involved, but not everyone. The rules don't seem to be too concrete and really are just picking and choosing for certain set pieces. It is terrifying though that someone could be touched and then haunted for just going into a house like we get here. I do think this series later on plays with some interesting concepts with this idea.Next I want to shift this over to the acting. What is interesting here though is that I don't necessarily know if we have a true lead as so many characters get their spot. Okina was good as this person who really is just wrong place at the wrong time. She has a good look though and I like what happens with her to start and close this film out. Itô has one of the creepiest things to happen to her of anyone. Uehara is solid along with Tsuda, Shibata, Matsuda and the rest of the cast. Shout outs to Ozeki, Fuji and even Matsuyama. The first two really get to do some creepy things and Takeo has a nice bookend in this movie.I'll take this over to the effects next. They really don't have a lot of them in this movie and they do quite a bit with practical. Fuji really helps here with how creepy she is when she is crawling. Ozeki gets props from with as well. I do like the make-up to have them wearing black eyeliner and have their skin really whitened up. There are some others that are done up as well which worked. There is some CGI that really doesn't hold up for me. I do have to point that out. I also really like the cinematography here. They do a really good job at playing with the frame and having things that the characters don't see, but we do. That is something that really makes me uncomfortable.Finally I'll go over the soundtrack and sound design of the movie. The score didn't really stand out, but it fit for what was needed. I did notice it at some of the more tense scenes, which works for me. What really is creepy is the sound that Kayako makes. I've heard that was done with a comb and running something along the teeth. The reason she makes that sound is both sad and wonderful for how it plays out for sure.Now with that said, I wasn't very high on this movie and I've definitely come around to it. It has an interesting way of telling the story that can get a bit confusing, but I think the more viewings, the more it makes sense. I like some of the ideas that they're playing with her. I do think there are some things that are bit off with the story though and some of the rules of this curse. The acting is good. The effects are as well aside from some CGI. The soundtrack is fine where the sound design gets under my skin. The cinematography is also well done. I would rate this as a good movie that is just borderline on an all-time great for me.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10",positive
"For the most part, this is a pretty good horror movie. It follows a two ghosts/demons, in a way, as they haunt and terrorise a series of loosely connected people who have each visited the mysterious house the ghosts largely seem to remain at.There's a couple of things that definitely hold it back from being great though. The first, more minor problem is the scares are inconsistent. There's a few moments that are supposed to frighten the audience - especially in the first half - that are a bit silly and take you out of the movie. But the last few scenes are very good and effectively creepy, and did a solid job at making me forget that not all the attempts at horror worked 100%.The bigger problem might be the structure. It starts and ends with the same character, but in between, it follows a bunch, all with pretty loose connections, and I don't think it made for a coherent, whole story. The fact that it started and ended strong, and delivered a decent number of creepy scenes made me forgive some of the story shortcomings though.As for its strengths, it does a great job at being creepy on a low budget, and making use of mundane settings and scenarios to deliver its scares. It's a tried and true way to make horror scarier, going back to movies like The Exorcist, which had horrible things happening in a relatable, grounded setting. It remains an effective strategy for horror movies. Also, the actors who played the two ghosts were really good.It's a good time, but with a couple glaring problems that I found myself willing to mostly forgive by the end. It's creepier than most horror films, even if it's got little to offer by way of story, and considering I was also mostly engaged throughout, I think that's enough to make this a solid horror film in my eyes.",positive
"This movie is fine. There are one or two moments where I found myself saying, ""Oh, that's actually pretty darn creepy!"" but there were also moments where I found my eyes sliding slowly towards my phone, looking for some distraction. If you have a true interest in foreign horror, I can guarantee you'll probably like this more than the average American viewer, but you certainly don't need to go out of your way to see this flick. It's fine.",negative
"Despite being a big horror fan, I have only recently got around to watching my first Japanese horror film. Ju-On comes with a big reputation, but if this movie is typical of Japanese horror, then I feel I won't be watching too many more.The film is split into five separate segments, each telling a separate part of the timeline of a haunted house. For some reason they are not shown chronologically. I can see no reason for this, other than to confuse the viewer and cover up the lack of any kind of interesting story.The talcum powder covered little boy reminds me of the kind of frights you get in a fairground fun house. The first time he appears it's pretty creepy. After that you're expecting him and he rarely fails to appear at the obvious moments. Each segment seems to end in much the same way, and although the first time we see a figure creeping down the stairs is a little freaky, by the third or fourth time you're really wondering why the characters don't just walk the two feet to the front door. Yes some people may be paralysed by fear, but most would just hot foot it out of there.There are a couple of decent frights in here that have been mentioned before by others, but overall it reminded me of our Paranormal Activity. The film is well shot and evenly paced, but most of the scares are telegraphed and then repeated. The only reason I haven't given this a lower score is that I'm aware this film has been made for a Japanese audience. Ju-On is a well known ""ghost story"" in Japanese culture, and therefore perhaps a significant something is lost on me, both as a Western audience and as someone unfamiliar to Japanese horror",negative
"After the worldwide success of Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu"" in 1998, the world turned its eyes to Asia's new wave of horror films, discovering an enormous source of new and interesting scary tales. Among the best of the bunch are Takashi Shimizu's ghost stories named ""Ju-on"", a new variation on a classic Japanese ghost story that started as a modest school project that became successful in the direct-to-video market of Japan. As the first two ""Ju-on"" movies became a popular phenomenon among fans, Shimizu gained enough attention to be able to make the third as a proper theatrical feature film. ""Ju-on: The Grudge"" was the name of the third film in this series and the film that made Shimizu's name famous, as soon he was hired to direct a remake in the U.S.At its core, ""Ju-on: The Grudge"", is a series of short stories all related to a mysterious supernatural presence that inhabits a typical Japanese suburban house. Through the years, we follow those who dare to enter the house, and as they find the horrors of the haunting we discover the origins of this deadly curse that seems to have no end. Social worker Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) is our main character (as most of the stories are connected to her), as with her visit to the house she unleashes a new series of supernatural phenomena.Shimizu's ghost story is an excellent retelling of the classic haunted house tale, spiced up with countless details from Japanese folklore, mainly the concept of the Onryo, the vengeful spirit. With a carefully developed script that keeps a nice mix of horror, mystery and suspense (by interconnecting the stories in a very good way), Shimizu delivers a rejuvenation of the typical ghost story for the new millennium's audience. While it is the third part of the ""Ju-on"" series, ""The Grudge"" is easy to follow, and it's probably more enjoyable without the information that the previous two parts give.While the story is probably not very original, the film's main strength is in the very atmospheric tone it has from beginning to end. The minimalist setting and the very artistic portrayal of the haunting (obviously inspired on Kabuki theater), give the film a feeling of dread that becomes more unsettling than the many scares the film has to offer. This is probably what makes the difference between ""The Grudge"" and the many other Asian ghost stories, as the constant creepy atmosphere makes up for lack of graphic images. With few pretensions and a nice taste for horror Shimizu creates one of the best films from the new wave of Asian horror cinema.The cast is mostly effective, and very believable in their roles, despite some playing nothing more than common Japanese stereotypes. Singer and actress Megumi Okina carries the film well as one (if not the most) of the important characters of the film. Yoji Tanaka plays former detective Yûji Toyama (another of the ""main characters"") and delivers an excellent performance (probably the best of the film), as well as Misa Uehara, who plays her daughter Izumi. Is worth to mention that dancer Takako Fuji delivers a terrific performance as one of the manifestations of the house, while not a demanding role in terms of classic acting, her talent as dancer is essential for the haunting image her character creates.While ""Ju-on"" ranks as one of the best Asian horror films of the early century, it doesn't lack flaws. Critics have pointed out that the stories get a bit repetitive after a while and sadly I must agree with them, as the lack of variety (due mainly to budgetary constrains) together with the slow pace may make the film boring for some. Also, as written above, some of the supporting characters are two-dimensional characters that seems to serve no other purpose than to make the plot move. Despite this flaws, ""Ju-on"" is a remarkable horror movie that certainly offers a different look to old folkloric tales of ghosts and haunted houses.Takashi Shimizu has created an interesting modern look for a story as old as mankind, and while it's definitely not a perfect film, it certainly offers a creepy atmosphere for a dark night alone. This very effective horror film is yet another proof that Asian horror is here to stay. 7/10",positive
"I first saw this movie in college before the release of the American remake in 2004 I was studying cinematography as I wanted to be an editor and at the time everyone was talking about Ju-on and how they found it to be terrifying atmospheric and creepy I even remember seeing a quote by Sam Raimi who made the Evil Dead trilogy saying ""One of the most frightening films I've ever seen"" seeing how the man who created one of the best horror series ever made found it scary I thought hey it must be good turns out it was a waste of time watching back in 2004 and in 2019 when I recently rewatched it to give it a second chance and sadly while it looks great and is well written it's very underwhelming and not very scary or memorable but still better than 2004 American remake.I don't know what people who saw this movie and found it scary were smoking before watching it because I'd like some as this movie while certainly a unique horror movie with an interesting story it is not however scary in the slightest the movie tells is split into 5 stories following 5 different young women terrorised by a powerful vengeful spirit that after coming into contact with the spirit are followed by it's presence until they are ultimately killed by the spirit.The spirit itself takes two forms a young boy and his long black haired mother who were both killed by there father and husband and with there violent death haunt the house they were killed in clinging to anyone unlucky enough to step inside the house the spirit visually can be the young boy who lures them around the house and follows them and his mother is the one who kills them she appears as an apparition on all fours hair in front of her face some minor blood on her hands and two white glowing eyes hardly the stuff of nightmares more the stuff of cliqued nightmares.The movie looks great is very well shot and directed with interesting camera angles and uses of sound are used to build suspence but mainly just lead to a jump scare not to original but the story is an interesting one and but if you don't pay attention to the storys progression it can get a little confusing.I recommend watching this movie at least once if you don't fine it scary you will certainly appreciate the movies cinematography and storyline.",negative
"An unnerving but pointless piece. Horror films like these are just asking to stereotype themselves to death.A good scare film finds a message and its the message that gets under your skin long after the thrills and shocks are passe. Ju-on is not only a cheap scare, it frustratingly direction-less piece. No head, no tail, nothing except a repeated eerie motif that is just begging to be lampooned.This one is destined to spawn a hundred imitations, and most of them will probably as drearily devoid of substance as the original.Go watch Ringu instead. 2.5 out of 10.",negative
"Rika, a young Social Welfare carer, is given the assignment of looking in on an elderly women when the regular carer doesn't show. Not long after arriving at the house, however, she starts to hear strange noises coming from inside a taped-up closet from one of the bedrooms and after investigating, she sees a young boy behind the door. She calls her boss for help, but it's here that she witnesses the spirit of a young woman above the elderly lady, causing her to faint. Shortly after, her boss, Hirohashi, arrives at the house, sees what has happened and calls the police. This leads to an investigation into what happened to the prior house tenants, but with more people starting to disappear, it starts to appear that a more sinister force is at work.Ju-on is one of the more commonly heard of - and probably seen - Japanese horrors, and it is not hard to see why as it's a good suspenseful film. Ringu is another well known horror and it can be a toss up between Ringu or Ju-on on which one is better. For me, Ringu is the better, but that's not to say Ju-on isn't just as good at times.As with a lot of Japanese horrors of this genre, Ju-on relies on creating tension & atmosphere to scare the audience rather than over-the-top violence & blood, and it succeeds as it is genuinely creepy in parts. It's also a practical effects and not a CGI film even though there are a couple of CGI uses, but these are brief and add to the overall feel of scenes they are used in.You also have to pay close attention to the story because Ju-on doesn't follow the traditional linear story line. It's 4 or 5 sub-plots that actually cross over and intermingle with each other to make up the main story. Like Pulp Fiction actually, so if you don't pay attention then you will very easily get lost. Some of the acting is a bit dodgy at times, but it's not enough to distract you from enjoying the film.If you're a fan of ""J-horror"" then Ju-on definitely has to be on your list of films to see.",negative
"By now, most audiences will be fairly familiar with the Japanese series of films known as Ju On: The Grudge; the phenomenally successful saga that began with the straight to video projects Ju On: The Curse, parts 1 and 2 - in which jealousy and adultery in a quaint Japanese suburb leads to an awful murder that marks the house for anyone who subsequently enters it - right the way through to the larger-budgeted Hollywood remake of the film in question and it's equally glossy sequel. Subsequent films following on from The Curse have taken the initial murder as their starting point and created around it a film of loosely connected horror vignettes; mostly in which a series of hapless characters end up in the film's iconic haunted house and then find themselves marked for death by the two most prominent apparitions of the story.If you have already seen the American re-make of The Grudge with Sarah Michelle Geller then there's a good chance that this Japanese original will come as something of shock. Unlike its US counterpart, this grudge features no real central character and has no real plot development (at least, not in the traditional sense). I personally don't see this as a bad thing, as it allows director Takashi Shimizu to concentrate on crafting a number of scenes of gripping high tension - as the collection of disparate innocents who unknowingly come into contact with the infamous house must come to turns with the unexplainable horror that is happening all around them - but obviously, viewers who look for things like narrative closure, explanations of plot developments and something approaching a hero that they can root for might be sorely disappointed.As I mentioned above, this version of The Grudge instead strings together a series of inter-woven scenes that establish the significance of the curse whist setting up a number of fantastic, edge-of-your seat moments of haunted house horror. This isn't a gritty gore-fest with annoying, smug, ultra-cynical characters (as seems to be the trend with much contemporary horror - think Wolf Creek, Hostel, Cabin Fever, The Hills Have Eyes remake and 28 Weeks Later) but rather, the kind of horror that should appeal to anyone who has had to walk home late at night through an empty park and felt the presence of someone (or something) following closely behind. Your heart starts racing as you quicken your step and become convinced that you can hear footsteps rapidly approaching from the left of your shoulder! When you finally pick up the courage to turn around and look, you realise your mind has been playing tricks on you, but the thrill was still heart-stopping regardless.I prefer this kind of horror, which is why I'm such a huge fan of the horror films coming out of Japan, China and North Korea; great works like The Eye trilogy, Wishing Stairs, Abnormal Beauty, Premonition, Infection, Chaos, A Tale of Two Sisters and Takashi Shimizu's own Grudge-follow up Reincarnation. It's slow moving and slow building, almost ambient even; often coming at you from the rear speakers rather than full and on in your face, which for me, really creates a great, eerie atmosphere that works perfectly if you're watching it at 1:30 AM and have to pause for a toilet break and to let the dog out to stretch her legs.Unlike a lot of his American contemporaries, Takashi Shimizu realises that horror isn't about what you see, but what you don't see, and with this in mind he saves any prolonged glimpses of our ghostly antagonists until right towards the very end. He also manages to create a wonderful feeling of isolation, alienation and hopeless emptiness; not only from the haunted house so central to the story, but even in the brightly-lit suburban streets, schools, office blocks and apartment buildings that our characters inhabit. The film is also shot very simply and traditionally, with none of the hyper-cutting and frantic camera movements of western horror, which again, gives the Grudge a more believable and authentic feeling that only heightens the senses of horror and tension. This is also helped by the wonderful performances of the cast who manage to ably convey the right sense of fraught emotion without descending into screaming histrionics.For me, The Grudge is great horror. I'm not even going to call it great Japanese horror because it goes even beyond that. This is horror for those who want chills rather than spills, and those who like to invest some serious time in something that is slower, more deliberate and more dramatic than the usual stalk and slash type stuff (not that I don't love that kind of horror as well, but it's nice to have an intelligent alternative). As mentioned previously, there will be some viewers who won't want to invest their time in such a film that has no obvious sense of narrative and no single identifiable character, but at the end of the day, that's their decision. But they're clearly missing out!",negative
"A Social worker named Rika is sent to care for one or their clients . When she spots a boy and then all of a sudden she encounters a shadowy figure and passes out. Police arrive she come through and It's revealed the house is haunted after a man killed his wife and son their spirits now haunt the house and pray upon any who enter it. I feel the best way to describe this movie would be a cult classic to foreigners. This is no way a bad movie but I think more people out of Japan would be more familiar with the 2005 American remake. The movie does start off on a good note and does manage to set the tone with it's atmosphere, However it feels as though it drifts away far from what was going on. It's impressive what they were able to accomplish with the budget they were given. Though quite a few of the actors don't really really put their all into it some of lines. It feels hokey and some parts. It also doesn't help that there's really no real lead in this movie.it seems like it's about Rika but then we're cut to the family that lives in the house and then the cops and then two other people. It gets to the point it becomes confusingly bit. You're focusing on too many people It's really a bunch of segments out of order of various people affected by the curse and after viewing it you can sort of put together the pieces of where they're supposed to take place but in some place it's messy. Some don't add up There's one scene where the cops go to talk to a retire investigator of one of the previous cases. He's not suspiciously answer them he wishes to be left alone. Then literally the next scene jump forward some years, he's trying to burn the house down and the cops are there for no reason. But despite those negatives there are some good things in the movie of the spirits Kayako and Toshio are given quite creepy moments in here such as a security camera and the elevator. The chalk white skin make them stand out.of course that disturbing death rattle stick with you. What also helps build suspense is that the music's really good eerie and creepy. Overall atmosphere in this movie is very good however with it's basic characters, it's very nonlinear story does have you lose interest after a while. If you can get sit down and get through it and make sense of it then you would actually enjoy it for what it is if you're not into those movies that don't really have a straight beginning middle and end you're gonna have some trouble watching this.",negative
"As the film explains, ""It is said in Japan that when someone dies in extreme sorrow or rage, the emotion remains and can leave a stain upon that place. Death becomes a part of that place, killing everything it touches. Once it sees you, it never lets go."" Ju-On aka The Grudge (2002) portrays a tale of this legend in which a house inhabited by a vengeful spirit haunts then murders anyone who dares cross its threshold.It's a simple story. Ghosts haunt the house in which they died. Doesn't get much more basic than that in a ghost story. However, what Takashi Shimizu did with Ju-On took this very simple story and turned it into a creatively structured and very, very creepy little haunted house horror. At first, the story structure seems rather confusing and awkward, but as the film goes on it becomes much easier to decipher and the complexity of the episode-like structure only adds to the strange and haunting story. Also, the portrayal of the ghosts Kayako and Toshio is extremely creepy, Kayako with her unearthly jerky movements and Toshio with his haunting sadness. I think the best element of this was the lack of false scares: no build-up music that bursts out when we're ""supposed"" to be afraid, no good guys jumping around corners pretending to be a bad guy, etc. Even though most of the sights of the spirits are brief and many will go by unnoticed, those that are spotted are very effective and very stirring. This is something that strays from the typical standard we're used to in which every scare has to be spoonfed to us with some kind of other effect to go along with it. This natural creepiness the film offers really makes this better than the majority of other similar recent films and solidifies it as one of the very effective haunted horrors of the noughties.Final Verdict: 7.5/10-AP3-",positive
"Ju-on: The Grudge is a very creepy and atmospheric movie. The noises from Kayako can be very chilling plus the ghosts of Kayako and Toshio themselves are scary, the scene in the bed really is unsettling. The film sees a women and her son being brutally murdered by the husband, this made the house haunted by a powerful rage where whoever enters inside will be killed the Ghosts of the family. The film has several stories about each of the characters that all connect to the house, as the stories unravel the plot starts to make a little more sense of what's going on since each characters story is at a different time-line.Ju-On: The Grudge can be a little slow paced at times but the creepy and scary scenes of the movie make up for that. Check this out. 10/10",positive
"After watching Ju-on: The Grudge, I was pleased with how it ended but overall I was scared out of my mind. Never again will I watch a Japanese horror movie alone.This film was both creative and fascinating. It was a great look in Japanese folklore. Comparing this movie to the American version, this one was more scarier and was done better. The American version was more into the effects and the shock factor. This original focused more on the scare factor, the kind that lasts more than a second.With the intertwining of stories and how they overlap makes it s movie you have to think about. The end result left me satisfied yet wanting to know more. I wanted to see more scares and more chills. There was a lot of explaining to do and since I don't speak Japanese, I had to read a lot.Although I found a lot of similarities to The Ring and Ringu, with the long hair of the girl draped over her face and the house being cursed like the video, there are a lot of good qualities that make this movie enjoyable to the horror movie fan.",positive
"A friend of mine once gave me the impression that this was probably one of the scariest movies he had ever seen. So sad then, to be the bringer of bad tidings, as this probably would have failed to scare even my Christian grandmother. Well, maybe I've seen too many horror-films, and as a result have become jaded, but that doesn't change the fact that this falls flat on it's cliché-ridden face! What really provokes me about this so called horror movie,is the brilliant idea the filmmakers had using a pathetic talcum-soaked brat to be one of the main sources of other-worldly ""terror""!! Yeah, that's a stroke of pure genius, it's never been done before, and I sincerely hope that filmmakers all over will take notice of this fact the next time they're shooting a film! Everybody knows that an apathetic and anemic brat is the most horrifying spectacle ever to be put on screen!! No, honestly,give him a f***ing dummy,put him to bed, and end the charade. And it's also a good thing that we have directors that aren't afraid of letting the audience know that they were directly tapping into the Ringu-idea-bank when making this! I have given this 2 points, but that is solely because of old and senile Sashie,sitting there with the most stupid of expressions!! Priceless!! If you want good Asian films, watch ""Ringu""(The first), ""Audition"", ""Tetsuo the Iron Man"" and ""Untold Story"" Keep away from this though....",negative
"'Ju-on' is the first foreign movie that I not only sat through but also liked.I've seen the American remake directed by the same Japenese guy who made this movie and it's sequel.To tell you the truth, I didn't think the remake was scary.It was definitely entertaining, but it definitely was no masterpiece.'Ju-on' is a surprisingly well-made horror film that slightly surpassed the remake.If you were wondering if it was scary, there was one jump scene and the rest isn't necessarily scary, but it's definitely enjoyable to watch.If you like movies about evil ghosts that kill people when they enter the house, then you should enjoy 'Ju-on'.",positive
"I found Ju-On (the Grudge) to be a great, but a very scary film the film starts in Japan, when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina is assigned to visit a family house. It looks like a normal, everyday house, but it has a very strange atmosphere to it something happened here once. She is cursed and chased by two revengeful spirits, Kayako, a woman murdered by her husband and her son Toshio. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears. now there is a terror here of a spirit that possesses this place. An evil curse and vengeful spirits seem to linger there. I found this film to have a very creepy feel to it as with all Japanese horror films.",positive

Scared of what exactly? When 'the scene' happened the music turned up was few seconds later when we already saw 'the scene', which makes this movie just another cheap trash.I expected it to be at least scary, but not even that happened.One of the worst and most stupid movies i've ever seen.

"*Don't go into those SPOILERS!* Japan; Rika, a young social worker is sent to help an old woman, since the last person who did vanished without a trace.Soon she will find out that the house is haunted, and that everybody who has lived there either died or vanished into thin air, ever since a man killed his wife in there.The evil spirits of the woman and of her son, Toshio, will haunt everyone who has walked into it, and they won't stop until they're gone.And so the curse spreads like a virus...This is not a metaphysic annoyingness like 'Ringu'; this movie will scare you out of your mind, and after seeing it, wheezes will never be the same again.It is a great work by director Takashi Shimizu, and it's a theatrical remake of his own TV Movie; I don't want to think about how scary the original TV Movie must be.The American remake has its work cut out for it; will it manage to equal the terror the original causes? Whatever the outcome, one thing still stands; 'Ju-On' is one of the scariest movies ever!",positive
"Movie is most interesting if you forget about story and look at it as a collection of creepy imagery. There are many such nice bits here: the videotape sequence, the woman who climbs down the stairs, the scene in the shower, the scene under the restaurant table. (And some that don't work -- a scene with many black cats came across as just silly.) The ""problem"" is that there's not much by way of story to hang any of these images on. The storyline's chopped up, much of the logic behind the hauntings is unexplained, at least to these Western eyes (are the boy and the mother the agents of the evil? Or just avatars? What exactly can and can't they do? Why are they killing people who have done nothing to them? Why is nobody really doing anything substantial to fix the problem? etc.) As a result it's hard to get involved in anything here, except in a fairly abstract, ""hey, that's a creepy moment"" kind of manner. Not bad, exactly -- this is my first taste of modern Japanese horror and apparently this sort of surrealistic structure is typical? -- but not something to go out of your way for, either. Maybe rent it, just to experience the imagery.",negative
"Sometimes remakes CAN improve on the original. The American Grudge was a sensationally scary movie {well,just check out my review} which was somewhat confused in it's plotting but skillfully maintained a creepy atmosphere and delivered a chill or a jump every five minutes or so. However,it must be said that some found it just funny {but didn't Alfred Hitchcock say that audiences sometimes laughed when they were nervous?}Coming to the original Japanese version of The Grudge {well,I'll call it Ju-on to separate it from the remake}after having seen the remake is an interesting experience. The plot is,at least for the first two thirds,almost the same and many of the scares are the same too. The ghost in the bed,check. The ghost on camera,check. The ghost in the attic,check. The boy in the lift,check. Maybe this is one reason why Ju-on does not seem as scary as The Grudge,because you know what's coming. Of course this may only be true if one sees The Grudge first,it's quite possible that that Ju-on will seem scarier if that's the version you saw first.However,it seems that director Shimizu Takashi did use the remake to improve on the original in some ways. Although there are a few effective scenes that he did not re-use in The Grudge,such as a bit involving zombie-like schoolgirls,the plot does become very muddled in Ju-on. In Ju-on,there are almost TOO many scare scenes,they lose their impact after a while. Although in my review for The Grudge I moaned about the confusing plotting, quite a bit was actually tidied up from Ju-on. With more characters who enter the possessed house and more shifting around in time,Ju-on becomes somewhat repetitive. The climax of the remake is more exciting,and some effectively nasty things images were added {atleast,to the uncut version}.Ju-on is certainly another solid example of the recent wave of Japanese horror films,with a very uncanny atmosphere and a refreshing and still very effective simplicity to some of the scares,such as just showing a boy ghost now and again,it's enough to send shivers down your spine. However,if you've seen the remake,than Ju-on will not seem nearly as frightening. Than again,maybe it's just down to which version you see first {I saw Ringu before The Ring and to me the remake was not nearly as scary}.",negative
Comes as a disappointment after The Ring. Supposed to be a Japanese horror movie. First off. The music was inappropriate. Too upbeat. Then the sound effects was too jarring. And the acting was comical. The scare effects was ludicrous. Don't forget I had the Ring to compare with. And the list goes on....,negative
"Next to the ""Ring"", ""Ju-On"" is easily the most infamous horror franchise to stem from the early 2000's J-horror boom. The series has incredible longevity, inspiring not only a slew of Japanese sequels and reboots, but a full franchise in America as well. As could be expected, the films have grown rather rote and predictable by now, but the original Japanese film remains to be considered a classic. And while it is a decent enough offering of supernatural horror, it's far from perfect. It's non-linear narrative is at once the aspect that makes it original, and one of it's downfalls. Because we're simply moving from victim to victim, the film takes on the feeling of a slasher film. At some point we're just watching different, completely un-developed characters be stalked and bloodlessly killed by the evil spirits.The film's best moments come from a strong sense of atmosphere and dread. It's terrifying to think of the haunting as a curse, that is not confined to one place, and cannot be escaped. The scares are entirely visual, but in this sense, they're hit or miss. Images such Kayako's pale, wide-eyed corpse sliding down the stairs with the movements of an insect, or the spirits of victims waiting outside their friend's window to claim them, are quite horrific. But then, other moments, such as a horde of cuddly black kittens appearing in a woman's bed, or a very poor CGI rendition of Kayako are completely ineffective. Truth be told, the film just doesn't scare me most of the time, and it's images aren't always as unnerving as it seems to think they are. It also doesn't help that the story of the central haunting is so cliched, in comparison to the more outlandish plotlines of other Asian ghost stories. In the end, it's a film that certainly has it's moments of creepiness, but it's a very mixed bag.",negative
"As many have said in other reviews, Ju-on is sometimes a difficult film to acquire here in the United States. However, the Grudge and Ju-on should not necessarily be confused, because Ju-on is in fact an entirely different film.I have personally studied Yokai (Japanese Spirits and Monsters in lore) and so far, I haven't heard of any type of haunting spirit quite like the ones in the film. Though I do have to say that the film tends to spend a bit too much time on some of the individual stories of the people who are affected by the spirits. The spirits do not physically harm anyone, until they are ready to take them to the spirit world with them. Before so, they do their best to literally scare the heck out of you. The woman and son who were killed by the woman's enraged husband (after discovering she was having an affair) have this almost pitiful sense. You are terrified by the spirits but because you know of their story, you also feel sorry for them. The house itself is haunted, but the spirit will follow anyone it has attracted itself to, so basically, once you enter the house, you are inevitably doomed.The movie isn't bad, but I can't say I was glued to the television the whole time. Stories of character stories tend to drag very badly, and all of the appearances of the spirits are entirely predictable.",negative
"This movie was recommended to me by a Japanese friend, who told me that the movie freaked her out upon her first viewing.  After seeing the feature length movie myself (with the same friend), I have to say that although there are some creepy moments along the way, the movie doesn't entirely make a whole lot of sense.  In particular, there is one scene where a father runs into his daughter when she's much older than the last time we saw her.  My Japanese friend explained to me that he was dead at this point, but only moments later he falls to the bottom of the stairs after witnessing something horrifying, and 2 others are at the bottom of the stairs to help him with his ordeal.  So was he alive or dead at this point?  Who knows, but both of us (even my native Japanese friend) were scratching our heads after this scene.  Overall it's not a great movie, but it's worth a look if you enjoy asian cinema and the horror genre in particular. Just don't expect too much.Rating:  6/10   some creepy moments",negative
"This was a story of a ghost who at one time was a wife who became a social worker and... OK, I really don't know what this movie was about because they never tell you why anything is happening. Apparently the wife cheated and her husband killed her? Anyway he didn't think the kid was his. Was there a DNA result? Who knows? The old woman who lives in the haunted house stays alive when everyone else is dying. Why? The social worker who gets sent by her co-workers to check out the house becomes the last victim, or the first depending on how you see it.The bodies of the security guard and the cops disappear to...? The pictures of girls who have disappeared have blackout eyes when the pictures were taken before they disappeared. Does the ghost have access to 1-hour photo? The cat. Is it a ghost too? As you can tell I have never gotten into the haunted house thing anyway but this movie was really bad and I couldn't tell you how it could have been better. Why? Because it wasn't a good plot and it wasn't that scary.If the ghost was that of the cheating wife why did she have to kill? At least in the Ring, which this movie is compared to, the kid was evil and that is why the mother push her down into the well.",negative
"Well, since The Ring we've been witnessing that japanese horror films, unlike Hollywood horror film, actually ARE creepy, and this one is no exception.With very few and simple means the director managed to tell a story so creepy that it actually works on me, and I consider myself pretty tough to creep out. Obviously it is inspired by a few Hollywood films but those are the better ones: The Shining (oh, yeah...I see a lot of Jack here, definately!), Twin Peaks and it has a story line that looks a bit like Pulp Fiction - sounds weird, I know. Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean..Just when I wanted to make this comment here on imdb, I realized that there is a sequel in the making. Normally I dislike sequels, cause as we all know they never live up to thier originals, but in this case I'm looking forward to it..And yes, I'm sure Hollywood will see this film as their next little rip off project. Why don't the americans just learn to read subtitles instead of always stealing the work of others and making it so much worse than the original.Anyway, THIS, the original, I give 8/10",negative
"The narrative technique in the grudge is completely arranged according to different protagonists, making the whole film very similar to the weird talk in Japanese horror films: the stories of different short films are put together in one film. This kind of weird movie is very oriental. Short, true, and rich in Zen: reflecting the unusual connotation in ordinary things. The narrative technique of the fierce bell at midnight is very westernized, rigorous and logical. The difference between these two points is not only reflected in the narrative technique, but also in the content. At midnight, the fierce bell is entangled in the content with the question of why a supernatural curse is possible. First of all, the protagonist has been looking for a reasonable explanation of the entire event, not only tracing, but also coping with this incomprehensible event; secondly, the story itself is also answering this question of why nature is possible. The curse is explained as a variant of smallpox virus. This rational attitude towards the supernatural is itself a characteristic of Western horror films. In the curse, both the film and the protagonist of the film seem to have no doubt about the possibility of a supernatural curse. The core factor in time causality is not logic but ethics. This is typical Eastern mysticism. From this transformation, can we see the development of the western center of culture towards a pluralistic center?",positive
"Looking back now, it's really not scary at all. The whole thing is to trigger the audience's fear by jump scale, but there is no plasma, which is between psychological terror and physical terror. The logic of the plot is so weak that it is difficult to live up to its reputation. Qingshuichong's early debut was the peak, but he was also trapped in this strange circle. Later, it was difficult to launch better works.",negative
"My review for Juon 2003 was very nearly my shortest ever. For while you can talk about plot, characters, cast and crew for as long as you want, some movies can be completely summarised in just one word. Ju-On 2002 is one of those movies; the word best describing it rhyming with kite.This really is disappointing from start to finish. Although it's technically a remake of Takashi Shimizu's TV movie of the same name, you wouldn't know it by the plot which is completely different (to the point of unrecognition) and - for reasons unknown - the director has ditched the creepy, understated visuals of his original for a graphically explicit medley of blood, gore and other such unpleasantries. It's basically Halloween 2 to Halloween.Plot holes are evident throughout but one particular nuance was a break from the norm: all of the characters were likeable people and we did get to know them through some decent character development. I did come to care for Izumi, Rika and co. and for that, Ju-On deserves at least two stars. The supposedly creepy blue faced boy was just laughable, however; I'm told that this was rated one of the scariest movies of recent years in its native Japan. With genuinely suspenseful entries like 'Kairo' and 'Dark Water' to compete with, I find that extremely hard to believe!So, in summary, if you like the idea of the film - a spirit returning from the dead to haunt the new occupants of the house in which they were killed - and want to see how it can be handled effectively, watch the original television movie from 2000. If you're just a fan of Asian horror and think this could be the next ""Ringu"", do yourself a favour and save a few sheckles. Not recommended - ** / *****",negative
"After having heard friend after friend and review after review acclaim the Ju-On series, I had to look into seeing it. I don't normally like Japanese horror very much due to the fact that most of the films in that genre I've seen have been either too bleak and misanthropic (or flat-out needlessly violent) to endure, or simply incoherent or ludicrous and hard to take seriously. However, I got in a mood and decided to give it a try. At the very least, while I was at the grocery, I could get some ingredients for some New Year's food. At first I was confused as to which one came where and realized that I had rented the original first movie of the series (The Curse I) and the final movie of the series (The Grudge II), and had to go get the others and watch them all together. As I knew from my research that they were not particularly in chronological order from Curse to Grudge (and really seem like entirely separate universes), I first watched Curse I, and then Grudge I. I came away feeling, perhaps unsurprisingly, not totally satisfied.That isn't to say that The Grudge I is a bad film, it's just, well, not a particularly good one. Whatever some may say about sequels...and especially horror sequels...typically by the third movie they've gathered steam and have polished the formulae they employ in the course of the film. However, perhaps what Grudge I suffers from most is a complete lack of refinement that should be there, electing instead to plod along incomprehensibly and attempt to rehash better, more impacting scenes from Curse I, its predecessor.When I watched Curse, I was rather confused at first but gradually came to understand more and more of the plot, and that things were not unfolding chronologically. This added to the suspense and terror because it was not even possible for me as a viewer to know what was really going on, which is a disorienting thing and, in Ju-On, often makes you feel like one of the characters being affected by this curse of rage. However, in Grudge I it's simply incoherent for the sake of being incoherent at times, and it doesn't have the same sense of closure and passing the torch that even Curse had to an extent. In Grudge I, we encounter several characters who are poorly-defined and unsympathetic, and their circumstances fail to elicit any kind of response other than wanting to find another bread crumb that explains the mysterious house and its terrifying inhabitants, which by now we should already know about if we've seen even the first film in the series.There are some serious continuity and logical problems with Grudge I, which don't help it at all, and you are left trying to connect incidents that sometimes occur too far from each other (either in time or interpersonal link) to have a logical connection. The situations are also set up extremely poorly, with some of the 'cliffhangers' holding absolutely no believability to them; for example, when the two hardened police officers were confronted by the leisurely croaking Kayako, one wonders why they simply sat there making goofy faces at her. In Grudge I, we are drawn into a world that simply doesn't make any sense, which may be disorienting indeed, but after a certain point it doesn't make for a good movie narrative. If the audience is unable to suspend disbelief, then the audience will not be frightened or moved at all by the experience. This happened multiple times in Grudge: the characters often didn't behave realistically, the dialogue was sometimes forced, and the situations didn't make sense, so it wasn't scary because we couldn't believe they were happening and, by doing, become a part of the scene by acceptance.I was unable really to find too much evidence that the writer had actually worked hard to make the narrative more streamlined and acceptable for a theatrical release, and even the (presumed) main character Rika jaunted around with no real purpose or definition. She had little personality and did little more, and again she was also part of the 'not behaving realistically' taint of this film. It was difficult if not impossible to identify with her not only because almost none of her actions made any sense, but also because we didn't get to know her (as we should have) through the course of the film, as was reportedly the intent of introducing a character consistently present from start to finish.The character of Kayako did at least receive more than a few seconds in the spotlight, and it was a good gesture to remind the audience that she was the first victim and the originator of the grudge of rage that the house possessed, or perhaps if someone didn't make the connection, that she was the croaking monster. However, by the time we were reminded of this, it didn't matter; superior Japanese ghost stories or films (Sweet Home, for example) might have moved us to some sympathy or pity towards the tormented and consumed-by-rage entity and perhaps given us a slight amount of closure or satisfaction. Not so here, where we are yet again more moved towards confusion than any other emotion, when we see the face clearly of the formerly obscured-by-shadow Kayako.As for faces, probably my final detracting point from the film is the fact that a great deal of the casting was very, very inappropriate and even further damaged its believability. Kayako looked unexceptional and not scary at all. If perhaps she had been as deformed as the face on the possessed television, then it might have been terrifying. But she was simply very plain, which may be terrifying to the vain only. Many of the other actors were just not very good, or had too small parts to make any impression whatsoever. The possessed young husband (Katsuya I want to say) was one of the least believable in his role, and seems more suited to another genre with his style of acting. This isn't to say that any of these people were necessarily bad actors, just cast in roles that were not appropriate for them or suited to them. Truly the only actor in this that seemed to be fitting casting was probably Toshio's, although Rika did the best she could with the weak characterization she was given.The effects, quite plainly, were awful. The bizarre black fog was inexplicable (and unexplained) and cheap-looking, and equally shoddy was the 'ageing' makeup job on I believe it was Izumi's mother. Horrid, horrid, horrid. These bad and cheap things were scarier than the film itself. What made the original so creepy was that it didn't go out of its way to employ any effects beyond what its reportedly meagre budget allowed; this one, made after the tremendous success of the original pair of video releases, must have had at least twice the budget of those and managed to look not quite as good or convincing. It seems a prime example of budget not applied in the right places, and care not given to aspects that it should.I must state again that I don't think it was an irretrievably bad film, and it's certainly worth a viewing for perhaps a fan of the original, just to see how the material has been rearranged for the big screen. However, I don't think it's worthy of a complete newcomer watching it first; I would recommend The Curse I sooner than this film, simply because it's more interesting and better done. There is a kind of curiosity akin to that of the proverbial 'train wreck' in terms of seeing how sequels do to films you love. Sometimes you get lucky and sequels improve upon the original or add things that make the original even more interesting, or further the continuity. However, you take a chance in also getting things that are simply rehashed or less compelling, and usually you receive aspects of both of these.In Grudge I, it was like a retread of Curse I, with a few more things added and attempts to make it more coherent, that actually had the opposite effect. It was not particularly well written, casted, or acted, and I doubt I will sit through it again. From what I understand the remake of it addressed several issues I had with it, so perhaps that will prove to be a superior film. However, as it stands I would not recommend The Grudge I to anyone other than a fan of the original Curse, who simply must see how the house's legacy is realized for the big screen.",negative
"I am writing this commentary right after finishing with the movie. I rented this DVD in order to see it Saturday night. It was a pleasant surprise, gave me the creeps ALL the movie. To begin with I would like to say that the movie is divides in episodes. Every episode is strange, creepy therefore frightening (with good scares) I am happy because it was EFFECTIVE. I WAS frightened. Horror is a genre where you can find lots of garbage. But suspense was well driven till the end and the actors were pretty good. I read a comment of the movie were the author said he was not entirely scared. It was not my case. I am still trembling. 10/10. Andrés.",positive
"At the time of writing this review this movie has a score of 6.7 and I consider that to be criminally low. I watch a lot of horrors and will confess to having become a fan of Japanese and Korean horror movies. The reason thats the case though is because of this movie. If you have only ever seen the American version of the grudge you should not think you have therefore seen this movie just because that was ""a remake"". This movie has some great ideas for visuals, some genuinely scary moments with a really good build up through the story, great acting and a way of telling the story which creates an amazing twist ending.Highly recommended",positive
"Okay people. Ever seen a movie that has scared you so much, you had nightmares? If it was American, trust me, it won't be nearly as scary as Ju-On The Grudge. The other day I went to the video store, planning to rent Ringu. They didn't have it, but I had heard that Ju-On was good, from this site. God Damn! It is so scary! This caretaker takes care of a house which is cursed. All these people die in the house and a bunch of creepy things start happening. Eventually, all the main characters die, but it is so freaking scary! If you are looking for a good scare, rent Ju-On. For a really scary effect, watch it alone in the dark! Overall, this is worth your time. It is so scary!",positive
"I've seen many horror films over the last 30 years, and this one has to rank as one of favourites, it made my blood run cold!I hear that already an American remake is planned, after the success of the tame remake of the superior Japanese original Ring.All I can say is watch this original, yes the jumping in timelines is confusing, but it is still a very scary film, with many chilling moments.If you liked the original Ring you'll love this, and for all you lazy Americans, for once make an effort and watch this truly frightening subtitled film. 9/10",positive
"This is a series of vignettes telling the tale of various people who have entered a haunted condo / townhouse (?). It is haunted by the spirits of a mother and son who were murdered there by the husband / father.It's kind of creepy but not really what I'd call scary.The scariest thing about it is that none of the men in the film had a wardrobe that fit properly. It's almost like they were all wearing Big Suits like David Byrne wore during the Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" tour.*shrug*",negative
"This film was a mixed-bag for me. As a creepy, horror film, there are many great things to like about this film: the effective horror scenes created by strategically filmed shots where the ghosts appear surreptitiously in and out of the periphery, the dark and ominous-- almost malevolent-- tone of the film, and the general creepiness that permeated throughout the film. Overall, the creepiness factor was on par with typically well-made Japanese horror films like Ringu and Dark Waters. Unfortunately, the story was where the film really lacked. Actually, there really was no story. The basic storyline seemed to be that a wife and child were murdered in the house by a seemingly jealous husband. As a result, and for no apparent reason, the house became cursed. And this curse, it appears, affects everyhone who comes in contact with the house, with the victims going through various stages of paranoia and madness before succumbing to death. The questions as to why the child and wife were killed, why the house was cursed, and why those that come into contact with the house are killed are not explained. The filmmakers, it appears, were satisfied enough with the justification that the brutal deaths of a mother and child are well-enough grounds for the house to become a great big sucking hole of evil. No other explanation can be got from the film. To sum up, the film was scary in places, and baffling in others. Overall, a decent diversion for those looking for a creepy film without much in the story.",negative
"The Grudge Legend tells of a mysterious curse, or ""ju-on"", that manifests itself in a place where a person has died during a state of great rage. When a husband (Takashi Matsuyama) brutally murders his wife (Takako Fuji) and son (Yuya Ozeki), the emotional impact of that event lingers in their small house in the suburbs of Tokyo for years to come. Those who encounter it include Katsuya (Kanji Tsuda) and Kazumi (Shuri Matsuda), a young married couple who are also sharing the house with Katsuya's elderly mother Sachie (Chikako Isomura), Kazumi's friend Hitomi (Misaki Ito), a retired police detective (Yoji Tanaka), his daughter (Misa Uehara), and a trainee care worker, Rika (Megumi Okina), who is assigned to check in on Sachie, and through her time in the house, helps the police begin to piece together the answer as to why so many people associated with the house and its varying occupants have died or disappeared under unexplained circumstances.2000's straight-to-video production 'Ju-on' and its sequel, 'Ju-on 2' marked Takashi Shimizu as a talent to watch. Now, with his back-to-back debut features now boasting something of a cult status, Shimizu has been able to revisit the Saeki residence for a third time, but with the promise of a theatrical release comes a dilemma. On the one hand, Shimizu has his fanbase of 'Ju-on' enthusiasts, who are eager to unravel the mythology of the franchise further. On the other hand, there's the general movie-going public to think of, most of whom haven't yet had the chance to climb into the attic crawlspace with Kayako, Toshio and pals. Shimizu has quite a storytelling task ahead of him with this latest instalment, but manages to create quite a terrifying experience with 'The Grudge'.~ 8/10 ~",positive
"This film is breathtakingly brilliant. Rather than attempting to come up with a convoluted plot to last duration of a feature film, the story is broken down into a series of shorts, all with a shared evil(s) and linking facets between the brief appearance of the characters.Strangely this works, it does mean that not much effort needs to be put into character or plot development.  What we do get is a purely relentless, patient and horrifying evil that slays just about every person that gets on screen.With very little gore (the reason I suspect that most other reviewers diss the film) the horror hits psychological soft-spots one after the other. The end result is, as in Ringu, a mythology that exists within this film world - a world that you pray isn't the one that we live in, but are still afraid we might.Although not on par with Ringu, it is an excellent effort in the realm of contemporary Japanese Horror.",positive
"The horror of a horror movie does not come from the picture, but the audience's fear of the unknown. In other words, ""the most horrible things often do not require you to watch, but guide you to imagine.""",positive
"It's hard for me to actually be frightened by movies. They have to be realistic in a way that I could believe it would happen to me, and this film ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" is one realistic movie. This is a haunted house tale with a twist, nothing like ""The Changeling,"" ""The Innocents,"" or films of that caliber, this movie is haunting on a higher level. Everyone who comes in contact with the house gets attacked by the blue ghost of a boy who's mother was murdered. The ghosts in this movie are very realistic and very scary. Definitely recommended.",positive
"I have watched this movie about two years ago and read the novel twice. Though the novel was much better than the film, the film was still outstanding. Marebito was done eight days before Ju-on but I thought Ju-on was a much better film than Marebito because Marebito was quite confusing towards the end. Ju-on is about a curse around a house. Anyone who enters the house will be cursed and killed. The storyline was quite decent though it lacks the mystery elements. The scary scenes took place both in the day and at night which made this film good. The ghost in this film, Kayako probably has one of the most serious grudge. Kayako was probably one of the scariest ghost I have seen in any horror film. This film was much scarier than ringu with many creative scary scenes though may be a little repetitive sometimes. The pale and angry face of Kayako covered with bright red blood was really creepy and rather shocking. The ending was done very well in this film and was really scary as Kayako climbs down the staircase. The elevator scene where one of the victims saw Toshio on every floor was one of my favourite scenes. The flaw in this movie is the opening scene, which was really unclear what was happening, but the novel which you can borrow from the library may help to explain what caused the strong grudge Kayako has. Do watch the sequel, it is way scarier and has much more interesting scares. Score:9.5/10",positive
"The visuals are freaky, the storytelling is unique and this is definitely the best movie in this series. Worth a watch if Japanese horror is your thing. If your a new horror fan, this is not for you.",positive
"A horror classic and for all the right reasons. I am a huge fan of this movie and really appreciate what it does. This is my third time watching it and it only gets better.We follow a group of people all hit by a curse. The curse dose all in it's power to kill anyone who comes into contact with it. It is a pure evil that doesn't discriminate.The movie can have a cheap feel to it with it's effects, makeup and camera work, but I find this inspirering. It can feel a bit student filmish and it's clear the creators used the budget well. The team clearly had to be inventive with everything and it inspires a guy like me that would love to make a movie myself. The movie is still well done and still works amazingly for me.The movie is well shot from a camera perspective and creates some iconic frames and moves. It works more like a fly on the wall instead of the chatecters POV. Showing us things we don't want to see that it would scare us. It does this very effectively. There is some wierd camera moves here and there but overall I find it really well shot.The acting seems good without me having a great knowledge about the Japanese language. The preformances seem good and believable. There is some amazing scream queens in this movie, and the actors that plays the spirits do brilliantly. They stay in charecter and sell the lost spirits really well.The sets are so well done because they look like the everyday world. They don't look produced like the typical American set, and invites you into peoples homes and something familiar to the viewer. It feels like an intrusion on the private and makes you want to check your hallways a second time before going to bed. The sets are also well thought-out, with details you'll notice after a second watch.The evil in this movie is pure. It feels pointless to fight it and that it can't be stopped. You feel as hopeless as the chatecters and having an unstoppable evil is dreadful and depressing. The movie shows us all the affected and how they die and the evil seems unstoppable no matter what. Young or old, it doesn't discriminate, it's just evil.The movie is full of iconic frames and sequences. From the stairs scene towards the end, to the elevator scene, the bed scenes and the wheelchair reveal. All are perfectly made, iconic and scary scenes.The movie is tied well together but could easily also be wieved as an anthology movie. All the different segments are thier own mini-movie that all are well crafted on their own. No segments feels overshadowed and Works all on their own. The overall ties works great too though and towards the end you learn more and more about the curse.Now here is probably the hardest sell about the movie but an aspect I liked. The movie is told out of chronological order and can be hard to follow the first time watching. I had problems following the plot the first time I'll gladly admit. But I appreciate watching it the second time and the third, I could apeiciate the movie even more. The movie really helps you to follow it's narrative though. It tells you early on that it's out of order and eases you through the different chatecters and tells and shows you how they are all connected. Don't be on your phone during this movie, pay attention and you'll have an easier time following the narrative.If you couldn't tell I love this movie. I find it scary, well done and really depressing in it's subject matter. It is an iconic movie for a reason, it dares to do a lot and gets away with it. I would highly recommend it.",positive

"First off, yes, this film lives up to the hype. It's definitely one of the best Asian horror films out there, worthy to be placed along side masterpieces like 'Ring' and 'Kairo.'
However, very few people know that 'Ju On: The Grudge' is a SEQUEL. And, like all Japanese sequels, knowledge of the previous installments is REQUIRED. The first two V-cinema installments, 'Ju On' and 'Ju On 2' (which are every bit as frightening as the feature) set up the backstory and the mythology. 'The Grudge' continues the story. See the first two V-cinema films before watching this...otherwise you'll just be lost. Together, the entire 'Ju On' series composes the best horror has to offer.",positive
"I'm not going to go into the plot or discuss the characters, there are plenty of comments going into detail about those already. Instead I'm going to cut to the chase and say that this film scared me on a near primal level. I watch a lot of horror and nothing has ever scared me like this.It seems many people don't find this frightening at all, I suppose it's horses for courses when it comes to a human being's fears. Some people have great big tarantulas as pets while some people faint when they see a spiderweb. If you have at some point in your life had fears about 'ghosts' and maybe a fascination about the supernatural, you may well be one of the people this film was made for.At the time of seeing this film (some 3 years ago) I was a call centre manager and it was my job to close and lock up the large office building in the evenings. After seeing Ju-On this became a bloody trauma every night! I was shaking and my heart pumping like crazy just waiting to hear that evil evil sound behind me. A grown man bricking it about ghosts from watching a film... Really now.Embarrassing as that is, this film brought back those forgotten horrors of childhood and damn it I love this film for that. Talk about emotional response.As a piece of cinema, this film is a strange one; haunting and eerie and strange throughout. There is a detached, stringy and dreamlike quality to it which is highly effective and a bit disorientating. It also features the best sound effect ever in the history of cinema as far as I'm concerned. I can't really give this less than a 10 since the effect it had on me was so powerful.A masterclass in terror, brilliant!",positive
"This Movie, as the second, are not ""Horror Movies"". They are Surreal Movies that come with Louis Bunüel Movies, and, now from David Cronenberg or David Lynch.

"I was looking forward to seeing this film as it had attracted some good reviews in the press, but I ended up disappointed.The film itself starts off well, but generally fails to deliver anything new or even remotely scary. The best (OK, first) analogy I can think of is a poker hand where you're dealt the ace and king of spades, followed by the queen of spades, then the jack of spades and, as your last card, the two of diamonds. The film has potential, but ultimately fails to deliver anything more than stock horror staples. In fairness, Ju-on does stray from the well worn horror path occasionally, but it doesn't wander very far and always ends up back on the path.I saw this film with my wife, her friend (both Japanese) and her friend's husband, all of whom are big horror fans - but even they conceded that Ju-on was a very average film. The overall feeling was that the film merits an average 5/10 and a ""must try harder"" rating.",negative
"A brilliantly chilling Japanese horror that is riddled with psychological shocks that break almost every horror movie rule invented. The shocks are mostly in daylight, the camera angles move in reverse to the action on screen (making the next shock totally unexpected)and the intrusive music is toned down to a creepy soft pattern that doesn't let the viewer know there's a shock around the corner. The chapters flit back and forth which makes for 2 or 3 viewings, and the creepy little boy is excellent as the cat-stroking menace. However the films ending has me at a lost, i just can't figure it out, is Rika the curse? please someone explain! overall a great experience 9 out of 10.",positive
"The Japanese have a reputation for producing some of the scariest horror movies this generation has seen. From the absolutely terrifying ""Ringu"" to ""The Eye"" & ""Dark Water"", so naturally, after reading ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was co-written by a writer of the original ""Ringu"", I was intrigued.I purchased this movie after seeing the trailer for the upcoming US remake with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and that looked interesting, considering the Americans usually tend to trash originals (the US remake of ""The Ring"" was a little disappointing), so I assumed the original would be far superior.The film opens with a slightly disturbing flash of images, including a blood stained man, an apparent murder of a cat(?) and a mysterious little boy. We later discover that a husband killed his wife and his son, and was found dead himself. The house is now inhabited by a new family, and Rika (our ""heroine"") is asked to go visit the elderly inhabitant. When she arrives, she discovers something hidden in a cupboard which is sealed by duct tape. When she opens it, she discovers a little boy. What she doesn't know, is she has unleashed a powerful curse.. the Ju-On. When ever someone dies in a state of rage, a curse is created, which then passes on to whoever comes into contact with it (according to famous Japanese legend). The movie follows the bizaare events that happen after, flashing between past and present, examining various inter-connected events to do with the house and the curse.The movie, at first, doesn't look terribly exciting. It does have a very cheap look, and it is a little slow to begin with, but once it picks up, it manages to pull in several disturbing scenes with demented imagery and jump moments. I admit to being quite scared through out this movie, but I always find myself scared watching any horror movie. The SPFX are low, but I give top marks ""Kayoko"", the victim who spreads the terrible curse, for her ""spider-walk"" and general menacing on screen presence (especially with the ""bones clicking"" and the strange chattering noise she seems to emit). The little boy isn't as menacing as other people will try and make you believe, simply because all he does is ""appear"" now and then, and ""meow"", which lets face it, isn't really frightening. But when combined with all the other elements, it works, and will leave you with an unsettled feeling. I was particularly disturbed during a scene involving CCTV footage, which shows a black shape walking down a corridoor, before looming up onto the camera, and out of the fuzziness, we see two pale eyes, which almost leaves you with a feeling that they are actually looking directly at you.Overall, it's not excellent, it's not going to win any awards, but, following the tradition of ""ringu"", the sinister atmosphere and camera angles pave the way for a memorable experience that will jangle your nerves. The American remake looks promising, let's just hope they keep to the original plot.*** out of 5",negative
"""Ju-on:The Grudge"" is the third installment into the ""Ju-on"" series. It is yet another movie that is made up of chapters that are all connected to the curse of the grudge.""Ju-on:The Grudge"" was well... okay. It wasn't horrible by any means, but it just wasn't that good. It was heavy of tense scenes, scares (some pretty good moments in it), creativity, originality, suspense, everything a horror film should have. The problem is... Well, it just wasn't that effective for me. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. I was fun to watch, at the least, which was good. I saw the remake before the original, so I wasn't surprised by anything. This wasn't anything particularly marvelous, but it was still kinda good.Watch it and give it a chance. 6/10.",negative
"This is actually the THIRD film in the four-film Ju-on series, though it's the first theatrical release. It helps to watch the two preceding direct-to-video releases first, since those establish the origin of the curse effectively. Also, without seeing these prequels, the plot of this one can probably seem kind of meandering.Shot on an extremely low budget, Ju-on doesn't have the cash to spend on elaborate special make-up effects or over-the-top set pieces (and the few times these movies do try to use FX, it tends to look pretty cheap). But to compensate for that, director Takashi Shimizu has crafted a story that generates scares through atmosphere, mood and lighting. There aren't that many ""jump"" scenes in the movie, though there are a couple of good ones; mostly, what Shimizu does is create a lingering sense of unease that can be very disturbing if you catch it in the right mood.So, if you liked The Others, you'll go for Ju-on. On the other hand, if you're a Freddy and Jason fan, looking for the usual bombastic, loud body-count sort of horror, you'll hate it.I happen to prefer moody horror, and I think it's more effective to scare people that way than just by throwing tubs of gore and CGI effects in your face. But I think most Americans have been conditioned to expect their horror movies to be very MTV-ish in style, and so this movie may just be too foreign for most U.S. viewers.7/10",positive
"I saw the trailers of Ju-On 2000 and Ju-On2 2000 and those looked weird & creepy. Thinking Ju-on: The Grudge (2003) would be the same, and it wasn't, it got some comparable Ringu style scares, the tension is average. Thats duo some switching of scenes what does not look very appropriate which is pity. Its obvious better than about anything what comes from Hollywood :).Can't wait till see Ju-On 2000 and Ju-On2 2000 they seem to have more impact as in FEAR!But still very recommended for fear fans.7/10Cheers",positive
"This movie is one of the worst horror i've seen recently. Plot-less, filled with pointless characters whose profiles are as deep as a sheet this movie is thousands km far from the excellent aisan new horror wave (darkwater..ringu..)",negative
"I finally got to see this movie after I saw the Grudge first. I probably shouldn't have done it this way, but I was left with no choice. The Grudge was a little darker, a little spookier. Both movies follow the same basic core story line. Some of the supporting roles are revised, but it works very well. Its nice to see these changes , it makes both the Japanese version and the American version different enough where I like each movie for different reasons. Both movies are made to please the viewers. Japan has a different idea of what horror is, and I like their view. Even cheesy Japanese horrors have personality. Something too many American horrors lack. You wont see much gore or violence in this film. This movie is more psychological than slasher. Plus this DVD has English dubbing so you don't have to read if you really don't want to.",positive
"After a few years influx of Japanese horror films it's going to be hard for any new films to surprise us. And ""Ju-on"" doesn't rise to the challenge.The film is told in a number of ""vinettes"" about people who have come in contact with a haunted house of sorts. None of the stories were very compelling and the lack of imaginative story-telling was furthered by a underdeveloped set and poor lighting. If a house is to be the setting of such horrific crimes one would think that they should get some sort of threatening feeling about it. But in fact one gets the opposite feeling, faulting the bright lighting and lack-luster set design. The director seemed to think that the oddity of the story would grab our interest enough to distract the viewer from realizing that there wasn't a strong story present. Even though the mysteries of the deaths kept me going to the end, I didn't feel like I got any pay-off or satisfying explanation to why the story(s) took place. There was some stunning cinematography involving the child and the mother, but it wasn't enough to either surprise me or make me recommend the film. Perhaps the director should reconsider a 2nd sequel and explore something new.Want some good modern Japanese horror films, then try ""Ringu"" (1998), ""Ôdishon"" (1999) and ""Uzumaki"" (2000).",negative
"The ""spirit"" in this movie was kind of creepy, but I felt like I wasted an afternoon watching this piece of pooh. It didn't tie itself together very well, the acting was second rate and it was very slow. I thought there was a lot of potential with this, but they way it was done barely kept me awake. It would be very interesting to see someone take this story to another level. I'm not sure what else to say about this, but I want my post to make it online now that I have invested the time to review this lame movie. Sorry to be dragging on... but 10 lines of text are required. We're almost there... Hang on... Wow! I feel like I'm creating a movie like the Grudge, now. Long, dull and a waste of time to deal with. Oh well, we're done now!",negative
"Ju-On: The Grudge follows in the steps of Ringu, The Eye, and Dark Water as another Japanese psychological horror film to hit Western shores (and to be remade (badly) by Hollywood). This is actually the downfall of this film. It follows the same scare tactics as it's predecessors and sums up to be nothing new - white powder make-up ghosts - check - long-haired scary females - check - set-piece in a lift - check. If this had been here first, it would have been so much more effective.Contrary to belief these films do not employ jump-out your seat scares, more ""Oh, sh*t, what the f**k is that"" kinda chills, and this is where The Grudge works. Basically its 90 minutes of set-piece scares and offers nothing in the way of plot or sense, but these scenes are well-thought out and effectively handled.A lot of people don't know that this is the 3rd film in a series of 4 (the first two were DTV), so like most horror sequels the plot and characterisation is done and dusted in the first film, and regurgitated (in most cases puked) again in the following sequels. This is, per say, like the 3rd Nightmare or Friday 13th film.However Ju-On 3 is much better than all Freddy or Jason sequels and any silly ""teen horror"" film Hollywood regurgitates, employing real horror and atmosphere. It also works as a great introduction to Japanese horror for any people unaware of its impact.6 pints out of 10.",negative
"The American version was good to me. I believe the Ring to be overrated compared to this. Let me state if you have not seen any version yet and are wondering if you will get into this.First off, watch this movie alone in a dark room. If you can have surround sound. The atmosphere created here is amazing. While a lot of Japanese horror movies have the ""Black Haired Girl"", this one is original to me. The atmosphere is the creepiest thing in this movie. Also if you know Kayacko(sorry can't spell it) story, you can't help but feel bad for her. You will like this movie if you go in with an open mind and like supernatural horror.You will not like this movie if you are more of an American Horror buff. I love American horror. But on theme I have seen among people who don't like this series is they prefer serial killers and such. Nothing wrong with that and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Overall as long as you like supernatural horror and have an open mind, this ranks as my favorite ghost movie. Quick side note, Ju-On The Curse is the original that aired on TV. This is the movie he made following the TV airing. I recommend this one first then watch the first version. Also the second Ju-On does something most horror movies don't; It is improved and the ending is SICK. Enjoy and watch.",positive
"after Ju-On: The Grudge has been over for atleast 20 minutes. I couldn't even give you a rough estimate of how many horror films I have seen in my life, but tonight I have come to the conclusion that Ju-On: The Grudge is one of THE most, unrelenting, jolting horror films ever. It's not to say it is one of the best, however. If you view this film and end up scratching your head (with your quivering hand, mind you) and wonder where the plot was, it's understandable. As one user pointed out, you must see the first two films which set up the backstory. I haven't seen the films so I reserve that judgment. Even with that criticism in mind, the great Dario Argento said, the fantastic does not have to make sense. Hauntings are a part of the supernatural which isn't supposed be sensible. Just about every movie has SOME flaws. Ju-On has several. For instance, the actors could use some make-up touches here and there between scenes and some of the acting is weak and many characters are simply flat and uninteresting (this could be because they don't have much screen time to develop). When you watch Ju-On: The Grudge, just enjoy it and don't think too hard about cliches or non-sensible plotlines.  This movie will basically fry your nerves.",negative
"Okay, well, to start off, I think that The Ju-On series is great in that it is a completely different style of horror filming that a lot of people have never seen before. I chose this movie to comment on because, out of the ones I have seen, it is my favorite, (unfortunately, I haven't seen the original TV versions.) Ju-On: The Grudge is my first favorite, then Ju-On: The Grudge 2, then The Grudge, then The Grudge 2.Ju-On: The Grudge is my first favorite because of the story/filming style, originality/atmosphere, and the scares. Although it is told in a nonlinear-style storyline, it is still explicitly detailed in the way that each character meets their fate. I'm a fan of cinematography, and I think the way Takashi Shimizu choreographs each camera angle is genius. Well choreographed camera angles are vital in horror movies, and if your filming style is done proficiently, I can guarantee the viewers will be satisfied. Everything about this movie is absolutely original. That's one of the things American horror films lack these days. I don't consider a violent, bloody slasher movie a horror film. Sure someone wielding a knife is scary, but not cinematically. The atmosphere and music definitely supply an eerie feeling. I generally don't get scared easily in horror films. The only time I get ""scared"" is when a loud noise happens and makes me jump. However, watching this film actually made me uncomfortable due to the atmosphere and the musical score.The scares propelled the story. The bizarre state of Kayako's ghost made it difficult to watch when she haunted her victims. If a horror movie makes me feel uncomfortable, it is made very well.Ju-On: The Grudge 2 was slightly lower than the first film. The story in this film was also nonlinear, but was told and tied together better. The filming style was done very well,like the first film. Being that it was a sequel, of course it wasn't AS original as the first one. It had its similarities to the first film, but it also certainly had its differences. The atmosphere was also very similar to the first film. The scares were also done just as well as the first film. So as you can see, there is VERY little difference between my ranking of them.For a remake, I suppose The Grudge wasn't so bad. It was definitely lower than the originals though. The story was good, but it was slow at times. The filming style also lacked quality to keep the viewers interested in the plot.I think this movie's highest flaw was it's originality. It was basically a remake of the first film, but with parts from both Ju-On: The Curse and parts from Ju-On: The Grudge 2. The atmosphere was slightly less eerie than the Japanese versions, I suppose because the set was different than the Japanese house, but was still quite eerie. In my opinion, the scares of this movie are equal in effectiveness to the ones in the Japanese versions, but only because they used better quality special effects.I went to see the Grudge 2 in the theater on the first night and I came out very very disappointed. I didn't like the story because there were three different stories, all of which were low quality and not very interesting. The filming style wasn't nearly as good as it was in any of the previous three movies.The originality WAS the highest flaw in this movie. They took parts from each previous movie in the series and altered them and added very few different scene styles. The atmosphere was not at all scary because of the locations and the fact that they rarely had horror scenes in the house where the curse originated.The scares were another major factor in why I didn't care for it very much. For some reason, they took out all the scares that they showed in the commercials. Every time I saw a part that I recognized from the commercials, I got excited, but only found that they took those parts out. Although I was highly disappointed, I will still buy the DVD when they come out with the unrated version. I think they are adding all the horror scenes not seen in the theater to the actual version.So overall, the reason I like the Japanese versions more is because of originality, atmosphere, and the scares. I think the only way to make them better would be to slightly enhance the special effects. Other than that, I love the Japanese versions and I think that anyone who has seen either of the American remakes should definitely consider watching these as well. I hope my review helped.",positive
"I remember myself watching Ju-on: The Grudge for the first time exactly ten years ago and feeling like ""o...k..."". I think it is the one that introduced me to the J-horror genre. And I really do think that if Japanese take advantage of their urban legends and traditional beliefs can easily be the masters of horror.Ju-on is actually the definition of what we call ""a proper horror movie"". Disturbing and terrifying, Ju-on is waiting for us viewers to lower our guards and strike unexpectedly. Although the movie is a ghost/haunting story, it is not a cliché type of ghost story (we actually have to deal with what Japanese people call ""onryō"", a vengeful spirit). It is gory to the core, depressing and unpleasant. The plot is successful and not disappointing at all.The sound is something that we should definitely praise, 'cause it does not let you down from the very first minute and really adds up to the movie (thank you Kayako...).On the other hand, now that I watched it for the second time after all these years, I have to say that sometimes I felt like the movie all in all was sometimes a little slow and repetitive. Although the plot was quite original, you may find yourself thinking that the director could have done better at some points.All things considered, I think that every horror lover should watch Ju-on: The Grudge.",positive
If your a fan of Asian Horror films you must see JU-ON. Otherwise you'll just be depriving yourself of a truly spooky experience and missing out on a great example of terror filmmaking. I suspect the negative reviews are from those who really don't watch Asian horror often and do not appreciate what these stories are rooted in. Do yourself a favor and ignore the negative comments and just judge the film for yourself. It's fascinating and will have you jumping in your seat several times while watching.,negative
"This comment may contain some slightly spoiling info, but I give no details. This was truly one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen. While the special effects were done well, they weren't quite the Hollywood wizardry many Americans might be used to. This and the fact it was all in Japanese made it all the more eerie to me. While not at all like The Blair Witch Project, it gave me the same sort of feeling.. that what I saw was a documentation of real events and not a campy horror flick. This film certainly breaks free from the standard mold of American horror. I say it managed to break free of the mold of standard American horror, but it did use several standard devices that you'll recognize, such as the eerie music leading to the fright, and so on. The plot was disjointed, showing the point of view of several different characters at different points in time. You never really had a ""hero"" or ""heroine"", but every character was susceptible to fear and the foibles of real life. You saw what would happen if you were in that house, not what a courageous ex-military super cop would do with a sawed off shotgun and grenades.",positive
"This wasn't really scary to me, and the story didn't make a lot of sense. I get that it's non-linear and episodic, but why doesn't anyone point out that the house is cursed or try to break the curse? It just has characters one after the other go into the house, start seeing things, and then die. A movie with the same first third of the movie or so, but then having someone actually trying to figure out how to break the curse would've been a lot more interesting.
Both the story and style of scares don't translate well for an American viewer.Also, some of the subtitles didn't seem to be translated correctly (a couple of them were obviously wrong as the english subtitle was nonsensical: ""she is paranormal""? Maybe they meant paranoid?).
In short, I probably should've watched the remake instead. This just didn't seem to translate well.
This isn't the first Japanese horror movie I've seen. I watched the original Dark Water with subtitles, and I liked that one a lot better than Ju-on. Ringu was also on my to-watch list, but after this, I'll think I'll watch the remake of that one instead.",negative
"I can't believe some of the messages here. This movie is one of the most intense, shocking and disturbing flicks I've seen in a very long time. Just when I thought I'd seen it all as far as horror films are concerned, along comes Ju-On and not only scared me in the theatre, I found that its effects affected my hope of a goodnight's sleep that evening.It works brilliantly and the whole shift back and forth in time only intensifies the experience. The images shock you as it is, but then the brain works overtime trying to piece together the narrative, struggling to make sense of what is a total mind-f*** of a story (kinda like 21 grams', only way better). The sound effects editing on this film are something else; probably the best since The Exorcist'. It all works in unison to deliver what is probably one of the most terrifying movies to land this century. Look and learn Hollywood!",positive
"...but what a non-scary movie it was. i admit, at the very beginning, about 5 minutes into it, i was somewhat interested. but then the plot descended into some kind of twisted-angle social commentary on how isolated are the Japanese city dwellers, and how they spent their time all by themselves in their tiny apartments, oftentimes spooked by a meowing boy and some lady with messy hair. i silently begged each character to turn on a TV, or maybe a stereo. i think one of them did, but what do you know! shopping network was on. the horror! don't they have mtv in japan? some dead horses got a pretty good beating in the movie. the unexpected phone rings. scared but going into dark places. scared but gotta open that door. hiding under a blanket was a fresh touch. but it's just it was sooo serious and sooo slow. come on, movie-making people, you gotta be fast these days, or else it turns into ""scary movie 1-2-3"". i had some juicy one-liners by the middle of the movie, but all went to waste as was by myself. to sum up. kid is not scary. lady is not scary. schoolgirls are not scary. male baldness pattern on the cop dude was scary. i give credit to the sound people, a great job on sound effects, but the story is just so bad and goes nowhere. will trade this for an episode of law & order: csi.",negative
"I choose to refrain from outlining the feature's storyline. Its a conscious choice of mine, potentially based on the fact that, in contrast with the majority of horror movies, the script isn't too important right here.Reading comments from other viewers I agree that one has to be savvy of the Japanese cinema style to get sucked in the movie and potentially needs to pay some attention in how the characters are connected with each other. Most would agree the film isn't a no-brainer sum of jumpy scenes with trivial horror directing tricks. Nevertheless, I feel the script isn't the film's cornerstone.Watching it I have to admit I didn't jump off my seat – although I was hugging a big pillow throughout, I didn't scream – and I have screamed with inferior horrors in the past. Nevertheless, I remained motionless allowing myself to slowly sink deeper and deeper into Ju-on's uniquely creepy experience.The overall horrific effect of Ju-on is extensively attributed to the clever cinematography and editing successfully preserving the Japanese style of cinema. I loved the naturally lit scenes and the straight-forward special effects which alongside with the laconic storyline resulted in a masterpiece I could compare with Stephen King's, IT. Both of them managed to scare the life out of me making my hair stand in salute, without anyone around me knowing.",positive
"Fantastically plotless and seemingly designed just to scare you this is the sort of thing that proves why Japan is better at horror than anywhere else (this week). How can anyone not like a movie where the entire plot goes empty house, spooky people, please don't kill me, aaaarrrrrggggghhhh I,m dead. And then repeats it five or six times. Love the fact that the lead villain is sometimes shown as a very scary shadow and some eyes and sometimes as a ghost.  No rubber monsters yay. A movie you have to watch even if it's only to annoy all your friends with ""the original was better"" when the remake comes out.",positive
"While the Grudge is not an outstanding movie, it has a few classic elements to it- like the creepy imagery and the rattling noise. I think it's one of those films you have to see once, whether you dislike it or not. The plot: It's there, certainly, but very thin since it's horror. Besides the small amount of back story on why the house is haunted, the movie only consists of random events happening. 5/10Characters: What characters? They were ordinary people, so you can relate to them, but forgettable as all hell. 0/10Horror Imagery: Classic and creepy, just as it should be. 7/10 This Japanese version is better than the remakes because: There is no dramatic music: so you can never tell when something's going to happen. In the remake they would build up all this music... you think ""Oh great, scary bit coming up. Brace yourselves"" then nothing happens, and it's a stupid repetitive cycle. All three remakes are in the one: so it more quickly gets to the point. Acting is brilliant and filled with emotion!Of course this movie won't change your life... so you can easily skip it without missing lots. But if you're going to watch the Grudge, see this version!",negative
"Ju-on is the Japanese original of The Grudge, which is its much more wide-spread American remake. The Grudge has become one of the most well-known horror movies of the 2000's and despite the fact that I was a child when it came out, I quickly became well acquainted with it because of its massive popularity. And for good reason. It is genuinely terrifying. But looking back on it today, it is honestly kind of goofy in its execution and doesn't really work as a story.What separates the two movies is a trait that is common amongst American remakes: the Japanese version has a lot more subtlety. It doesn't provide a lot of jump-scares, it lingers far longer with suspension and it doesn't really have any flashy effects. These things work to the movie's credit in this case. Ju-on is a collection of short stories in which all of the characters in some way come in contact with a haunted house and are afterwards haunted by its angry ghosts, in the form of a white-faced woman and boy who makes (very infamously) death-rattles when they near their victims. And that's about it. The rest of the plot in these stories surround how the characters deal with the hauntings and how they are ultimately murdered brutally. Which doesn't honestly make a compelling story, but what makes Ju-on work is that it is so scary with so little effort. It's bleak and unrelenting, it's slow and undramatic. I think it's quite incredible - compared to all the CGI monsters and loud jump scares in the world, nothing compares to a woman with a white face and ghoulish eyes.The best parts of Ju-On are the part where a woman tries to hide from the hauntings of the ghosts in her apartment and turns on the TV and...well, the result is horrifying. This along with the scenes of a school girl trying to hide from the ghosts by hiding in a dark room with the windows covered by papers. What makes these scenes so fantastic is that they really take their time with letting you feel their fear. The scenes are not just the ends to a mean of serving a big scare, but rather letting the suspension and despair be the ends to the means.Ultimately what Ju-on does best is capture a true reflection of the unforgivingness of death, coming after us, slowly but surely, one by one, taking its revenge on us just for living. If you have the guts, it's not a masterpiece but it really is the experience of a lifetime and a milestone in modern horror.",positive
"This movie is a brilliant tale of suspense and horror the tale is creepy and hard to understand as far as the story unwinding. The tale is of a grudge laid upon all the people who come into contact with the house, the house is a resting place of murder where a man firstly killed his wife and then upon the story everyone who comes into the house is met by a dreadful fate of death the story is expressed through different views from different people so the story unwinds into a brilliant tale of horror and suspense the movie is better and a lot more detailed than the American remake. The movie I cannot explain in much detail without giving away the brilliance of the movie but all I can say is watch this film its brilliant and is a ten out of ten movie I enjoyed the film it is scary and not to high on gore which is good because it relies on suspense and is never short of a suspense filled moment",negative
"I agree with other comments, it was confusing and I had trouble telling the female actors apart at times, they were all lovely but similar looking. Anyway, as far as the scares go, I guess it's subjective. I found about half of them didn't work on me but the ones that did....holy god, those were the best frights ever! I'm a bloke but at one point I actually moaned in uncontrollable terror and found my fist in my mouth. It's the atmosphere of creepy unknown that does it for me so yes, I loved Ringu and The Eye. I can't rate it as high as Ringu because of the jumbled plotting but because the scares that worked were SO HUGE for me, I recommend a look.",negative
"I feel like this movie had so much going for it, yet failed due to a lack of drive. The ghosts in this movie are very chilling and some of the scenes are filled with great suspense, but the lackluster plot unfortunately did not captivate me. It almost seemed as though I watched a few 10 minute films rather than a movie. What I found also disappointing were the lack of ingenuity past the first showing of the ghosts. The main spirit with the notorious vocal fry must have came down the stairs the same exact way 3 times, while the little boy simply hides in corners to make you jump. Don't get me wrong, it's scary...for the first few times. By the second half it starts to get old, along with the lack of plot driving it in any direction. It simply doesn't evolve in any substantial way. I really tried to enjoy this movie, however it was a letdown for me.",positive
"I laughed so hard when the lady came down with her massive eyes croaking like a frog. I laughed even harder when the little boy with the massive eyes hissed like a cat. The rest of the movie was okay, not great, but I love hearing the croaking and the eyes big and cheesy.",negative
I just want the reviewer to know this is the third installment of the storyline.  I'm mixed emotionally about the fourth movie It could be great and with the original director it could be excellent.  THat's all it needs really.  So if the third movie of a trilogy confuses you go get the first two! :)  They're awesome I've never been so scared to go to bed before and scared of my closet.:)Lisa,negative
"Having read a really terrible review of this modern classic, I feel forced to draw yet another picture of this quite unknown film. I have seen many horror films in the past years, and as far as I remember the only one worth remembering was the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This was until I sat down in a Spanish cinema and watched Ju-On. I was disappointed of the far overrated Cabin Fever and decided I should have on more go. I didn't know anything about this movie - and anyone who saw this one in cinema will understand when I write - that it took me completely by storm. Guys around me started chatting or making stupid jokes, when the real horror began, but this is just the usual reaction of local heroes proving how masculine they are to their 14 year old girlfriends. It may be true, that it's quite difficult to follow the storyline (is there any?), or not to confuse the characters (sorry, but to me all japanese look the same, except Mr. Myagi) but one that's for sure is, that I never ever felt so much real fear caused by a movie in my whole life. This one isn't about cheap booo!-moments, what you get here is nothing but sheer terror, and this is what so many horror fans waited for so desperately. OK - Local heroes around the world, gather your girls and nerves and prove that YOU are the man, because this is just the picture for it.",negative
"I first ran into this director's work when someone loaned me a copy of the original Juon TV movie. I let it rot for a few days before sticking it in the VCR when I was alone and bored.How deeply it affected me is about on par with this first production movie. To put it simply, this series of films are terrifying and genius, but only if a certain qualities are met.First of all, NEVER watch this movie with a loud person or someone who chatters through a movie. In fact, watch it alone so you won't laugh either. Some aspects seem absurd, but when there's no one to laugh with, you won't get distracted.And genius because the director has completely broken from the standard norm of American or Japanese horror movies. Honestly? I'm tired of Ringu clones. This movie shows a startlingly workable change in plot style, suspense and theatrics. Instead of hiding the monster, it's there at every second. Instead of yet another boring, convoluted plot, it simply exist as a video time line of events as this plague of supernatural rot spreads.I love this movie, and as long as you stay away from laughers, you very well might too.",positive
"Having not seen any of the other entries in the series, or the American remakes, I will decline on commenting about any of them. What I will say is this film works especially well as a superbly paced horror/thriller movie, with more than a handful of moments that will leave you anxious and unnerved.For a majority of films in this style (a ghost story with very little emphasis on gore and violence, although those elements play a part), the idea and unseen presence of a malevolent force is far creepier than actually seeing it fully revealed on camera. This is not really the case for Ju-on: The Grudge. The scariest moments by far consist of the actual shots of the film's antagonists and supernatural beings. Their unorthodox movements and appearance are some of the more terrifying things to behold on a small or big screen (at least in the case of mainly Western movie watchers such as myself).The plot is not needlessly complex, although others have mentioned the occasional confusion resulting from the non-chronological order of the story. I almost guarantee that you will not be watching this film with the intent of following the plot progression; this film simply provides a real scare the likes of which have only occasionally been witnessed in the horror genre.Highly recommended for those who value a great fright.",positive
"Having read a few negative views of this film I felt moved to defend what is possibly one of the creepiest films to come along since...well, Ringu.I made the mistake of watching this during the day time...which is the time of day when most of the horror in this film takes place. This is a film which gave me genuine chills and a deep sense of unease as the story unfolds. I suppose you can't ask much more from a good horror film than that...it stays with you long after you've seen it.True, horror films can split an audience right down the middle - and this film appears to be one which you either 'get' or it goes straight past you.If it scared the bejesus out of the great Sam Raimi (of Evil dead fame) and inspired him to produce the currently in-production 'remake', then its good enough for me. With that recommendation, it should be good enough for you too!",negative
"This film and Ju-On 2 creeped me out more than anything since Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" back in the '60s. Ju-On and Ju-On 2 are fairly low tech, but very effective, and neither film wastes any time with useless back story or character development. They get right on with the scary stuff. What these films demonstrate is that good horror does not require expensive sets, puppets or special effects. Often it is the simple tales that tap into our innate fear of the unknown and skillfully use cinematic technique to both reveal and hide just enough information to cause a fearful reaction. I noticed my son closed the window in his room that night and I myself was a little more interested in what might be lurking in the darker places in the house. That is the lingering effect of a good horror film.",negative
"As a volunteer projectionist at the 2004 South by Southwest Film Festival, ""The Grudge"" was the last movie I showed.  It played at midnight at the end of a slow day.  I didn't even know what it was about.  I started it and began to walk to the concession stand to get a glass of water, but I decided to stop and check out the beginning, just to see what the movie was about. I never got that glass of water.""The Grudge"" is the latest in what has become a fine tradition of Japanese horror films in the last decade or so.  To hear the plot described, it would seem terribly unoriginal.  The magic of the movie is in its unconventional sequencing.  The events are broken up into chunks and told out of order, which is incredibly effective in maintaining the audience's interest and creating mystery.  I don't want to give the story away, so I'll just leave it at that.As far as frights go, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. People were walking out, visibly shaken.  I don't know quite how to put it into words, but it says a lot that an event which is completely predictable and takes place in a brightly-lit room can still scare your pants off.  Hats off to the director in this accomplishment.",positive
"The Grudge details the experiences of a number of individuals who have come into contact with the terrible ""curse"" that dwells within a seemingly normal (but in fact haunted) Japanese home. As a viewer, one is led through a maze of startling interconnected events occurring in different times and places, all somehow related to the horrifying curse.This film is, and will long be, one of my personal favorites. From beginning to end, it is superbly written, acted, directed and executed by all parties involved. I was immediately drawn into this story by the graphic and troubling opening scene, and my interest did not flag in the slightest throughout the remainder of the movie. The initially confusing plot twists and distorts itself, eventually coming together in a mind-blowing climax that will make you say, wide eyed, ""Oh! I get it now!"" A feeling of growing dread accompanied me as I watched, and I frequently had the urge to look away from the screen. In my opinion, inspiring that kind of genuine fear in its viewers is what makes a horror movie truly outstanding.So who shouldn't bother watching? If you preferred Ghost Ship over Ringu, Ju On is definitely not for you. This cinematic masterpiece is in a completely different league than the insipid, run-of-the-mill American horror movies we are spoon fed on a yearly basis. The Grudge will appeal to the intelligent, open minded moviegoer, particularly those who enjoy semi-psychological thrillers.9.5/10",positive
"I've just seen this movie at a ""surprise premiere"" where you buy tickets to some unknown and yet unreleased film, not knowing which film it is until it actually starts.Within 10 minutes 100 or so of the audience had walked out, but that isn't really that unusual to the surprise premieres.20 minutes into the film 200 people had left. THAT is unusual, but I guess many of them just gave up on having to read the subs. The rest of us (around 1.000 -to give some perspective) stayed ...and laughed. My god, we laughed. None of us was able to take this film seriously.Don't get me wrong; I'm a fan of J-horror and the whole horror genre actually. I don't mind the cheap effects or the low budget feel that you often see in horror, but I DO mind the poor acting, the poor story, the poor directing and the complete absence of horror.For some reason I DID like it, I enjoyed it. I'm just not sure why./graynote",negative
"You may say that Ju-on makes no sense, but what you lack is an ability to follow a story sequence.Sure, some of the ideas used in this film were used in others....But what I want to know is, how can one person seem so juvenile in a movie review? You may not like it, but that doesn't give you the gall to trash a really great movie in such a childish manner.Sam Raimi's is a well respected director. When he praised this film, he obviously saw something special in Takashi Shimizu's work.You can't compare the two directors because of stylistic differences.A fair review is an INTELLIGENT review.And for those of you who are planning to see this movie, watch it with an open mind. I was scared, and even screamed a few times... I'm sure you'll get a thrill as well.",positive
"Ju-On is a simple, chilling, and well-executed movie for its time. The story tells about a brutal murder inside a house, leaving a curse behind. Then a bunch of victims get dragged into the mess and get some frightening experiences, and deaths.The atmosphere and mood was the main thing that kept this movie going and attracting the audience. The ghosts show up when you least expect it, along with some scary music in the background. Some scenes have no music at all to increase the tension, kinda used in ""Signs"".This movie would leave you breathless and scared out of your minds. You will push every door from a room that you enter. You will always sleep with one eye open. You will always be sensitive to tiny sounds around the house. And most of all, you will be afraid of the dark once again.Ju-On is recommended to be watched every Halloween at night. 10/10",positive
"If you're a fan of the horror film genre, but you've seen the guts of an American teenager spread across the screen once to often you could do a lot worse than spending a night with Ju-on: The Grudge. Be aware that this is very much a film of the eerie, rather than gory kind, similar in style and content to other ghostly offerings from the Far East such as Ringu, Dark Water and The Eye. The film begins when a volunteer social worker is asked to visit a particular house and soon discovers that all is very far from well. As the film progresses we learn more about the history of the house and the nature of the malice which seems to haunt it. The structure does not conform to traditional chronological conventions and the way in which it is rudely sliced into chapters may grate with some viewers. However I came away refreshed that a film had provided some genuinely chilling and disturbing moments without feeling the need to throw a bucket of blood at the camera.",positive
"OK, it's confusing, the plot make no sense, and the acting was dodgy as hell. But, the brilliance of this film lies in the fact that anyone can die. Anyone. There's no hero, no one to keep you safe at the end of the movie. It's as tragically nihilist as horror gets. Maybe I just don't know enough about horror movie tradition, but when do you ever finish a movie without having the stock virgin heroine surviving? Much of the movie relies on the tension produced by focusing on seemingly irrelevant things, such as the rafters in the ceiling, and in terms of content there's a depth of symbolism that is much greater than the story itself. Safety is an overriding theme: a ghost cat is a refuge for the scary kid; technology does not provide the escape route we all hope; even groups of people are no guarantee of survival. All the usual horror films clichés are sidestepped, consciously. The film is almost an anti-Scream, avoiding rather than celebrating horror history, and failing to create a nice structured outcome. I am not saying this film is the best horror ever, or even that it's an amazing work of cinema, but at the very least it has to be appreciated on its own terms.",positive
"Well, some years ago, I was being told how good are Japanese horror movies. After seeing the disappointing Ringu I had reasons to doubt them, and Ju-On gives me some more. This movie here is a repeating jumple of stories that relies heavily on showing you spooky ghosts killing random people. And by heavily I mean there is a ghost showing every three minutes or show, rendering the whole spookiness ineffective. Of course, odds say some of those scenes will be creepy and some are. Not many, but there are plenty of chills. As for the deaths... forget it, they get scared to death or something.Overall, well-made shorts that don't work together that well. Personally, I felt like watching Lucio Fulci's The Beyond minus the inventive deaths, insane gore and artsy non-plot. Which actually leaves as nothing...",negative
"I must say despite all of it's shortcomings in terms of character development and pacing (Jesus Christ it should have ended at about the fifth segment!!!!) Takashi Shimizu's ""Ju-On"" remains one of the most startlingly unconventional horror films I've ever seen, even by ridiculous Japanese standards. Its baroque high concept fantasy elements are surreal and outlandish no doubt, but writer/director Takashi Shimizu chooses to ground all this with some of the most flat and restrained direction and cinematography in any genre. The movie looks like it could have been shot on some teenage kid's digital video camera (and given the budget it might very well have been). There's no ""movie bullshit"": everything that happens just more or less happens. It goes a long way for selling these fantastic happenings as real life to the audience. The music score is fantastic, choosing to go for haunting mournful tunes instead of standard Psycho-inspired hijinks. And of course the sound design is responsible for at least 25% of the scares (cue the famous throat rattle...) And then there's the ending: I wouldn't call it a ""twist ending"" because the film doesn't spend much of its time trying to pull the wool over your eyes and the ending doesn't dramatically reshape your understanding of the story up til that point; but it is indeed a clever surprise! Very much in the great Lovecraft tradition: spinning a yarn til its end and then throwing in that nice extra surprise at the last moment! (Shimuzu's Lovecraft influences are on display even more prominently in his later and much better film ""Marebito""). All this is fantastic, but Ju-On fails on one key level and that is pacing. The film drags horribly in between spook scenes. The film slaves to its gimmick of introducing a new main character every ten minutes. The idea starts out novel but grinds on well past its worth. Instead of roughly ten sequences at roughly ten minutes each, five sequences at twenty would have been far more effective. Only a few of the perspective changes are essential to telling the story and having to pick up the pieces every ten minutes as to where we are in the plot is distracting. Also this would have allowed for more character development, instead of a barrage of exposition as to who the new victim is. Again, this is obviously Lovecraft influence, but it's very uncinematic. The acting is pretty standard: no one stands out which is kind of appropriate since its a revolving cast of characters. Overall, a flawed but worthwhile effort and a must for any horror fan.",positive
This movie is not that scarie compared to it of other horror movies like the conjuring it and many others this movie is confusing at the end. I DONT GET WHY PEOPLE WITH BAD HAIR AND AND BLOODSHOT EYES IS SCARY,negative
"When watching a movie, I tend to see beyond the areas of what we see and hear, and notice what we cannot see or hear. Subtext in movies is almost non-existent at times, and this makes for a dull and unmoving experience for me. While many movies throw subtext at you in such large doses, it's sometimes impossible to follow the story at all, being drowned by them.Ju-On: The Grudge is different. While not as scary as many horror films claim to be, I found this movie to be the most intriguing film I have seen in my whole life. Unlike many other reviews and opinions I have read here, I totally understood this film, having cared enough to really look beyond what I could see or hear. I was only ever initially confused by the ending, but the second time was enough to cure that. The background to the curse made sense to me, the lives of the characters were enough for me to truly care about them, and the plot lines of the story will remain with me forever. Not totally relying on scares (sometimes nothing scary at all, but these moments are truly unfortunate circumstances), this movie features many moments that make you sit back and wonder how it happened (as most people seem to comment on). Personally, this makes me want to watch it over and over (indeed, as I have only just finished watching the movie after having only just watched it i.e: twice in a row), to fully appreciate the depth and quality of the production. I say 'quality', as this is the only film of late that has made me feel this way. So, I really loved this one for being more like a natural story.Story: *spoiler part* Ju-On: the Grudge is about a house. It is a house where a man named Takeo Saeki (Takashi Matsuyama) has killed his wife, Kayako (Takako Fuji) and son Toshio (Yuya Ozeki), and the pet cat (which plays a significant role in the overall story), after finding out a horrible secret about his wife. He then kills himself. It is here that the curse, this Ju-On, is focused - waiting for anyone to come into its influence. Skip forward a few years, and we are introduced to Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina), a volunteer care worker who is given the responsibility of taking care of an old woman, after the original carer has gone missing. And so, Rika goes to the house of the Tokunaga family, where she is initially worried about entering, but goes in anyway. After finding the distraught old woman, Sachie (Chikako Isomura), she attempts to clean the house, while noticing the horrible stains Sachie is leaving around her room.While cleaning, Rika hears a noise coming from the floor above, and she goes to investigate. Entering a strange room near the back of the second floor, she hears a scratching coming from the wardrobe. It's there she finds a cat, and then a little boy. Frightened at first, Rika then finds out the boy's name is Toshio. Not too soon after, Rika is directed to Sachie's room, and here she witnesses an unexplained death of the poor old woman and faints.After this, we are subjected to a series of separate stories, detailing the various people who have encountered this curse, and the way in which they are effected by it. It only skips the proper time-line twice, though, if you carefully watch it. And throughout the story, we see Rika and her connection to the house and the ghosts of Kayako and her son Toshio.One part to watch out for is the scenario of the girl Izumi (Misa Uehara), a part omitted from the American remake. It's the more original part of the whole movie, and is the more surreal (and has some of the best psychologically-intended acting).*end spoilers*I love Japanese life. After having lived there for a few years some years ago, I came to understand the way of life of the Japanese people, and watching this movie puts me in a common situation (at least at first), where I can see the world I lived in through the eyes of the director and his vision. The director, Takashi Shimizu, had a vision with this movie. I've watched the interviews/behind-the-scenes stuff with him, and saw that he really wished to have a movie that would create a sense of wonder; that we can watch many times. He has accomplished this with me, at the very least. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, for it's freshness and for it's take on a genre (Japanese horror) rarely seen by western eyes before.Personally, I think the actresses and actors in the movie really give off a natural air so extremely rare in a movie these days. They are so natural, it really is like watching real life for me, and having been in Japan and been a part of everyday life there, I can totally believe I'm there once more. I have been totally taken by this movie, and it is now a part of my life, always in my thoughts, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Lastly. I can understand why many filmmakers have praised this movie. They have appreciated the sense of wonder the director has captured on film. The movie is respected, as it really is a great movie to own, if you step back and delve deeply into it's actual storyline. Rather than sit there and dump on this movie for your misunderstanding of it, try and find out as much as you can before you pass a judgment. To those who haven't seen this, it is probably best for you to rent this, and see for yourself. As for me, I haven't looked back, and I will never regret having bought the DVD.",positive
"While the acting is below average and the character choices are annoying and cheesy, the grudge actually made me defecate in my trousers.",negative
"I watched this movie during my ""horror phase"" during the 2010s. I watched a bunch of horror movies, but I was often disappointed by the weak plot, the overuse of jump scares and the monsters. However, I was really pleased by Ju-On.You won't be scared to death, nor scream your lungs out after the scary scenes, but you will feel very... uncomfortable.As an east Asian, the cultural proximity could have helped me to be more immersed in the Japanese style horror stories. Yet, I think it is the design of the ghosts that made me feel very uncomfortable.Some may say there's nothing scary to see humans painted in white with a bad hair day, but ... they are scary.Especially when you saw real ghosts in your life. During several times, at different age, when you were wide awake and filled with so much energy you could play rugby for an afternoon.One of the best horror movie I've ever watched.Ghosts are real.Their pain and their grudge made them unable to go to the afterlife or the paradise. So they trail around trying to vent out all of their pain, so they can rest in peace.They are just around you but just can't see them.",positive
"I'm a huge, huge horror fan and was dying to see this film after reading so many amazing reviews. Sad to say I hated this film with a passion. I actually fell asleep woke up and fell asleep again this lame film couldn't keep me awake to save my life. I cant understand why it's getting so much praise. The theater I was in people were laughing every time you saw that little boy or that lovely person in the cheep black Halloween makeup pop up on screen. I know Asian films have the ability to create some killer characters and effects hell just look at Takashi Mike's work.Don't take my word for it go and waste your money too, and you will see why this film is called the grudge.The only thing I liked about the time spent in this movie was that I was able to catch up on some sleep.",negative
"I saw it yesterday at the surprise premier too. I on the other was very positively surprised. If it hadn't been for all of the people being annoying and laughing because it was a language there weren't used too, I would actually have been scared. I would like to see it again as I am afraid I lost a lot of the details in the story. Unfortunately as it very often is with Japanese horror movies, the ending is lacking a bit. The story itself doesn't have a closure IMO, but otherwise it is worth seeing. If you liked Ringu you might like this. It is not entirely up at the same level, but it is not so far away as others have stated, still only IMHO.",positive
"This is the original (unless you consider the two movies this is a sequel to) but that doesn't mean it's any bit better than the American version. The story is hard to follow, many chalk it up to a cultural thing but that's just an excuse for bad writing. Rules in this world relating to the curse are inconsistent and are changed at will just because the script needs them to change. 
 Far too many pointless deaths, and all suspense is lost when you're told who's going to die constantly throughout the film (which this may actually be a cultural difference I still found it annoying and opinion is subjective). There is no ""horror"" in this horror film, just cheap jump scares that had me shouting at the T.V. in anger at the laziness constantly.
 To be fair, this wasn't an awful movie, infact it wasn't bad at all, but quite frustrating and boring. There are worse movies out there, and definitely better ones. If you've never seen it it's worth a watch, I suppose. Especially those who love foreign films, I think this works better as a foreign drama than any type of horror film. But, if you're interested in watching something a bit scarier than this, with a better developed script and improved logic, don't waste your time and just watch the American version.",negative
"This movie seems to have either great fans or people that are dead against it. I am part of the first mentioned. I am not new to the Japanese horror genre; I would call myself a fan. But I have been disappointed a great many times. Not on this occasion. After the much anticipated (yet greatly disappointing) ""Ringu"", ""Dark Water"" I picked this copy up with not much enthusiasm. Praises!!! It was AWESOME!! One of the few movies to ever scare me at all (add to that the fact that someone was actually murdered in my house; and we have a serious winner) What I like most is the fact that the movie doesn't tell ALL the facts like why does this ghost kills people that haven't harmed her or what the pale looking boy is actually doing (being evil or just likes to hang around his mom?)But come on, do they need to tell all? Isn't the fact that you don't know everything and no-one is save even scarier? They also let you find out some things by yourself. The plot is cut-up into little sequences and these little parts are not in chronological order. See the movie twice.It helps. Finally, the best feature about this movie is the fact that it's not scary in the sense that it's filled with blood and guts; but the great job they did on the atmosphere in this film. It's dark and macabre.Some people would describe Kayako-crawling-down-the-stairs as silly or even funny, but combined with that ""aaaahhhh"" sound it was in my experience one of the scariest images in horror movies in a LONG, LONG time.",positive
"Watching scary movies does get better with a good surround sound system. Ju-On the Grudge proved it with its superb sounds that, added to the visual images, did send chills down my spine. With the intention to scare us audiovisually, the director had achieved his goal many times in this movie.Nowadays, watching movies without a good surround sound system is like watching a color movie on a black and white TV set. Let's all go out and upgrade our sound system and I bet you that Ju-On, the Eye, Ringu will surely send something down your spine. Back to the movie, all actors did a perfect job, including the old folks during their short appearances. For those who want to see the original Japanese version, Ju-On was released 5-6 months ago as a region 3 DVD. Asian movies are best watched in their original versions without being edited by second hand proprietors.",negative
"This film has everything you've seen in other asian horror films, especially Ring and company, except it just doesn't work here. The suspense is lame, the ""surprises"" are not surprising, the story is cliché, and the action is so predictable. If you have seen, as I did, hundreds of asian horror films (especially japanese), don't bother !",negative
"I totally disagree with the reviewer who says that Ringu was scarier than Ju On. Ringu is predictable and rather dull except for the parts where the girl crawls out of the TV. Ju On, like its evil spirit namesake, grabs you right at the beginning and never lets you go.Ringu and Ju On share many elements, such as the spirit's ability to use technology (such as cell phones) to make its presence felt, and the mysterious/mystical way in which it operates. What sets Ju On apart from any other horror movie I've seen recently is that at no time does it let you rest.From beginning to end, this movie captivates and creeps you out. One of the creepiest movies ever made, and highly superior to Ringu, which by comparison seems like practice for Ju On.",positive
"I have to say that I don't understand all the hype for this film. It was pure schlock. There was nothing surprising or scary. The ghostly little boy looked like he was slathered in kabuki makeup. The story line was predictable from start to finish. The story was told out of chronological order, which was confusing and pointless. I think the director was trying way too hard to be artsy. The acting was... well there wasn't any acting. The feel of the movie reminded me of those awful Japanese monster movies from the 1960's and 1970's.I saw this film in The Angelika, in New York City, with a full audience. We were all laughing out loud at how preposterous the thing was. Don't waste your money or your time on this one.",negative
"After watching all three of the American Grudge movies i was told about Ju-On, of course i had known about the Japanese originals, but i never actually seen them. After watching this movie i found it to be quite intense iv always been a fan of J-horror but i must say this is one of the best iv seen in a while, compared to Ringu (which was also awesome btw) i have to say this movie is better in my opinion, here are a few reasons why; The story, the atmosphere, the intense scenes, the horrific images, the acting and off course the vengeful spirits Kayako and Toshio Saeki played by Takako Fuji and Yuya Ozeki both fine performances by them i must say. Another thing i like about this movie is that it doesn't use blood and gore to scare you it's simply psychological suspense that gets the movie going. Overall if you are a fan of the Grudge series you will defiantly like Ju-On, Takashi Shimizu is an awesome writer and director and i hope to see more of stuff real soon.",positive
"I don't know if you are thinking of watching this or you have watched it and you are not looking it up but...this movie is just not scary. I am not saying this is as an American used to watching American Horror movies. I am saying this as a horror fan. This movie is almost comical in its approach to scaring the audience. IN fact, if you go into the movie thinking that, you will indeed see what i am talking about and probably get a few laughs out of it. It is really not even entertaining otherwise. The points that are supposed to be frightening are also actually fairly predictable. I have yet to view the American version of this movie, and probably won't. I am sure there are scarier Japanese horror movies to watch than this one, so just jump over to those.",negative
"Warning! May contain Spoilers!By: Christopher Yagi Review of 'Ju-on: The Grudge' (not the original TV version) Genre: Horror Director: Shimizu Takashi Year: 2003The Grudge. Quite an understatement, considering the body count. Anyway, if you've taken a good look at all the recent Asian horror cinema shows, you'll see that they're a nice bundle of condensed awesome more from its atmosphere than its visuals. Ju-on takes that, guts out the story, and bumps up the visuals, while keeping some of the atmosphere. What I got was something that gave pretty mixed feelings about what, exactly, I think of the movie. On one hand, it was purely based on freak aspects, depriving me of several weeks of good sleep without a floodlight somewhere in the room. Therefore, I kinda liked it. On the other hand, there was no story. Okay, there were a few background details, like how one character was a social worker, another was a teacher, and all that. But really, so what? Even soap operas have better background details than that.The story starts with a message, saying how a Ju-on is something about a person dying a horrible horrible death, and getting really pissy about it. And so there was this woman, dying a horrible horrible death at the hands of her husband wielding an X-acto knife. Their little boy hides out, apparently avoiding the same fate, so instead the cat bites the dust. None too pleased, the woman haunts the house she lives in, and so does the cat. Except the cat apparently possessed the boy or something, because in some parts of the movie the boy kinda screams like one. And so, a bunch of people at different times walk into the house for one reason or another, and, in a nutshell, dies a horrible horrible death, ultimately from the hands of the woman. Since the movie jumps from one time frame to another, I'll put all the deaths in chronological order. A couple moves into the house with the husband's mother, and they both die kinda mysteriously, but seemingly from the catboy. The husband's sister drops by for a visit but was told to go back home by her doomed brother. However, the woman and the boy manage to follow her home. Her quick thinking got her under her bed covers, where surely the ghosts would never see her. Needless to say, she was dragged away. The husband's mother dies during a game of peek-a-boo with the social worker. I think. The social worker's boss comes in, and later on just dies, but under a sink in a hospital, for whatever reason. A cop tries to burn the place down but eventually runs into the ghost. Doing the whole ""deer staring into a speeding car's headlights"" thing, he sits and screams as he comes face-to-face with the ghost. Just then, his colleagues come in, hold hands, and screams as the cop does the smart thing for a change and dashes out the door. Oh, he dies too. The social worker mentioned earlier lives on for quite a while, compared to everyone else. Then she dies, and so does one of her friends. And lastly, the daughter of the cop mentioned earlier dies not only from the woman, but from three of her zombified friends.Okay, fine, the story sucks miserably. So instead, what the movie tries to get you to do is to ignore the story basically, but immerse you into horror after horror. This, at least, was done well since the visuals were downright creepy. Well, it can't really be properly described in words, it's one of those ""see for yourself"" kinda things. If I try to put it into words, I'll just end up sounding silly. Does ""little boy with mascara"" sound scary to you?The acting, on the part of the two ghosts, were good, but repetitive since they kinda ended people's lives the same way every time. Except for the woman at the stairs at the very end, which was probably the best scene in the whole movie. The other actors had no problem freaking out since the ghosts were seriously unsettling to see.The verdict:5 out of 8 - I'm currently sleeping with a nightlight on. That counts for something, I guess.(c) 2004 Eight Trees CineMANIA",negative
I'm just writing this to say that this movie is amazing and I would recommend it to others anytime. One thing I feel it's my duty to explain to others though is that if you are confused about the timeline of this story that you should know two things and it'll all become clear. When izumi meets her father in the house she's seeing him in the past. Secondly izumi's story is the very last one even though its not last to appear in the movie.This might be clear to a lot of people but I find for me being raised on western movies where everything is spelled out for us it was kind of difficult. Don't let this deter you though as this movie is well worth the cost.,negative
"OK i just finished this movie about ten minutes ago and i've still got shivers over my spine when i think about it. it's a good film but not nearly as good as ringu.although it did scare me more than ringu(every time i saw the boy he scared me and i had goosebumps all over)ringu had more of a story this just seems like an random killing spree of 2 ghosts and the end doesn't explain why who or what makes them do this other than they've been killed by their husband/father(OK i know this should be enough but shouldn't there be a way to stop them,well probably not cause this doesn't stop the film is just over and thats it)i still have to watch the second one maybe that one explains more and has a more satisfying ending.but all together if you like suspense this movie has got a lot of it. it was a good horror movie with some good scary moments but if you are a story man don't watch this cause there isn't any. despite the seemingly bad review i'm giving,this movie still gets a 8 out of 10 from me just for the great suspense.p.s. i like it when a movie ends and people don't live happily ever after cause thats reality but there should be an end good or bad.",negative
"(Spoiler alert! but read on because you may save money)I know why the movie was called ""The Grudge"". After seeing it, you will carry a grudge against the distributor, director, and publicity company which advertised this as a scary movie, and all the critics who claimed that it's a remarkable film. You may also hold a grudge against them for simply spending your time watching this celluloid bowel movement.Let me start off by saying that this movie has no plot. It's just a bunch of scenes of people seeing ghostly shapes, or one of the ghosts (a small boy with a cat, a woman, and a crazy man). We never learn why these ghosts are haunting the house that the film takes place in, or why these people seem to be afraid of darn near anything. At one point, a women is frightened to death of harmless, banal things like her cell phone ringing, and her teddy bear. Nothing scary happens. She just picks up her teddy bear and scream s at it, then throws it away. Her cell phone rings, and she gasps in horror. Why? Is she insane? Did she suddenly become retarded? Why does everyone in this film make great big bug-eyes at everything?There's a lot of scenes like that -- scenes where nothing scary happens at all, but the characters react as though something did. You'll be rewinding the DVD (if you were fortunate enough to not pay to see this in a theater) to see what happened, only to find that nothing happened at all.The film suffers from bad acting, lack of continuity, lack of any discernible plot, and most annoyingly, a total lack of any horrifying atmosphere. Everything is brightly lit and clean. There is no shadow. There is no substance, and anything resembling a frightening, threatening atmosphere is totally missing. There really is nothing scary in this film at all. If your idea of scary is seeing a small, naked boy, whose body is white because he's apparently dead, hide in the shadows, or seeing a white woman crawl down the stairs with blood on her face, then go for it. I found the scenes with these ghostly characters to be very unfrightening, and the reactions of the characters to these ghosts to be contrived and phoney at best. I was never convinced that these people were being scared by anything, or had anything to fear -- nobody gets killed or put in danger. We hear lots of strange noises in this film, and some say that the sound design of the film is one of it's most frightening aspects. None of the sounds are frightening, and most importantly, we never really see the connection between the sounds and what they're supposed to represent -- they just become annoying and repetitive. I am convinced that the people who are heralding this film as some kind of horror masterpiece are either crazed Japanese Animation fans who think that anything produced by Anime directors or studios must be superior to western films, or Asian cinema fans who haven't really seen a lot of actual horror films. ""The Ring"" and ""The Others"" are far superior horror films in every way. The grudge can't even compete on their level. I was upset that I wasted 90 minutes watching this over-hyped trash. This film is a waste of time for film buffs as well as horror buffs.",negative
"as opposed to the last person who complained about this film, i actually thought Ju-On was genuinely creepy and had an interesting story-line. I've seen a lot of horror films and i think the Japanese ones are usually always more creative, have more suspense and atmosphere, and tension and they aren't crammed full of whiney teens who i barely miss when they're killed off. Ju-On and the premise, ie a curse that is born when a person dies in the grip of a powerful rage, is actually more than fiction. i've read a lot of Japanese superstitions and it's in there. the parts that stood out to me were, 1. the part in the bedroom, 2. the security guard, and 3. the dead school-girls, also the part where Toshio is looking up into the elevator on every level was original effective. the only other thing i have to say is, films like this aren't gonna be made better with an Americanised remake. The originals are always better and i honestly don't see why Americans even bother doing remakes for all these films, they only end up making them look bad. to anyone who dislikes this film, don't knock it till you actually know the story and aren't gonna look like a fool by saying things that aren't correct.",negative
"I just watched this on Amazon Prime and I'm not really quite sure what I saw. The problem I had was the different stories of the different people and I have no idea where I was in the timeline of events. I swear I saw one girl as a child and next thing you know she's a teenager, but I thought the people talking to her father when she was a child were contemporaries of the current timeline.Also is it the law that every single person just falls down and waits for some really slow crawling thing to reach them and touch them?Just like the Ring, it was interesting in the build-up and then really disappointing at the end. I'm going to stick to Korean horror it's a lot more interesting.",negative
"Have to say, I didn't think this one was all that good. Although other people have commented on how it delivers loads of scares albeit with a thin plot, I found it to be thin on both. All of the fright scenes were telegraphed well before they happened and, to be honest, the whole film was basically just a collection of repetitive 'jump-scenes'. The plot made no sense & the direction was boring to say the least. It seems an obvious choice of comparison, but Ringu (even Ringu 2) was far superior than this one, and this film blatantly lifts a couple of scenes straight from them! Was interested to hear about Sam Raimi's praise for this movie, but I really can't understand why anybody (least of all him) would want to have it remade, other than to cash in on the popularity of 'The Ring'. Won't be checking out the three other movies in the series on the strength of this one. :-( 3/10",negative
"I didn't get to see all of it, 'cause I was about to go to school, but I came to the part where that lady who croaks all the time, was coming down the stairs and the girl (forgot her name....I think it was Rika) was having all the flashbacks and the girl disappeared. It was pretty good, except that I really don't think it should be rated R. It wasn't that scary, it was just seriously messed up on some parts! No offence, thats just my thought! I saw the other Grudge, the newer one and first time I saw it, I was SO freaked I had to sleep with the light on and music, otherwise I'd keep on hearing the croaking sounds. The second time, I was fine, then the third time I was like ""Why I am I here...this is so lame!"" So thats why when I saw this Japanese version, I really didn't think twice about the rating. Anyway, thats all I have to say! So...uh...Sayanora!",positive
"The first time I watched this movie, I didn't expect anything this terrifying. I had seen The Grudge and I liked it even though it really scared the jeepers out of me. So when I found out there was a Japanese version I was curious. I watched it. I don't know how, but as I watched this movie I could feel the creepy atmosphere of the house just like Rika did, when she first approached it. I didn't scream at all, unlike when I watched The Grudge, but The creepy piano theme at the beginning and end of the movie was enough to send plenty of chills up your spine.The opening scene goes something like this: Ju-On- The curse of one who dies in the grip of a powerful rage. The curse gathers and takes effect in the places where that person was alive. All who encounter the curse die and a new curse is born. Then, it shows Kayako sitting in a garbage bag. It appears she was beaten badly resulting in a broken neck. Takeo is shaking with rage and biting his nails. He then tapes back together the family portrait which he removed Kayako's face from. Meanwhile, The cat is howling noisily in the background. Takeo finally loses it, grabs the cat roughly and dispatches it. Hearing the cat being dispatched Toshio hides in the closet in fear. Takeo appears with a knife and edges towards Kayako, pointing the knife at her throat (/opening scene)and you know what happens. Takeo drags Kayako's dispatched body up into the attic. Then he taped the closet door shut with Toshio still in there. And (rumor is) the curse killed him on the street! And, that wasn't a very comforting opening scene. It was most disturbing. So the storyline follows a young volunteer(Rika) at the Social Welfare center. Her boss can't contact the man who usually looks after Ms.Sachie, the old woman who's family moved into the cursed house. So he asks Rika to check up on her, and eventually she agrees even though this is her first time working alone. Rika is then cursed, as well as many others that dare enter the house. The ending Kayako-crawling-downstairs scene is especially frightening. Watch if you dare!",positive
"This is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen. It had me frightened of the dark in a way I have not been since I was a child. I was particularly impressed by the way in which the film takes the sweet and innocent child and the schoolgirls and then transforms them into objects of terror.This film does not rely on special effects or malevolent monsters to scare you. Rather it uses the imagination of the viewer. The children are transformed in to objects of horror by altering their appearance and movements. It is as if they have metamorphosed into alien life forms, but are still recognisable as human! You are appalled by their aspect.The evil force which is preying upon them is entirely unexplained and irrational - it's purpose is to take the everyday kindness of the family, school friends and the care worker and invert it. So the neat simple Japanese house becomes dirty and untidy - horrors lurk in the cupboards and the attic. I'm sure you get the drift by now.Watch this film and be afraid, be very afraid!!",positive
"My honest opinion on The Grudge (Ju-On 2002).I like to think of myself as someone who enjoys horror, and after getting bored of modern American horror which I think a lot can agree is steadily degrading in quality, hearing so many people say such good things about this movie peaked my interest. I've heard a lot of stuff, like how Asian horror movies are the scariest, or that the Ringu and Ju-On have ruined childhoods, so I thought I'd give this movie a try, in hopes it would genuinely make me feel scared. I've been looking for a movie to scare me for the longest time, but to no avail. All I can say is after all the good words about this movie, and after watching the movie my self I don't think ""disappointed"" does justice to explain exactly how depressed I am after watching this students-project excuse of a movie.First of all, there's too many characters, all were 2D and dispensable. None of them were interesting and we weren't properly introduced to any of them. They all died, so who cares.Scares were cheap, often jump-scares or loud noises like a random orchestra hitting the drums or using the violin whacked up to 200% volume. I even fell victim and raised my volume because all these cardboard dispensable side characters are whispering to each other like they're scared the clap of their dummy thick ass cheeks will alert the ghosts to their location, and as a result had my ears drilled by a Big Black Sound effect when a women looked at a child. Can't make this stuff up.I got to the 50 minute mark of the movie, and even if I had a gun to the side of my head I wouldn't be able to tell you the events of the last 10 minutes because I genuinely can't remember. That's how bored I was.All I have to say is if this movie scared you, you're either new to horror movies or were shown at a ridiculously young age. Peace out, not recommended.",negative
"Once again the Japanese have proven that you don't need Spielberg's budget or overrated CGI to make what is probably the scariest movie of all time. This movie works with superb sound effects and background music to build tension and the final payoff at the end of each segmented but interconnected story is like the end of a bout with Mohammed Ali.  You feel beaten and exhausted from the fear but like an Ali match, the next round does it all over again.  I nearly had a heart attack from watching this.",positive
"Like so many else, I had heard this to be a scary piece of Asian cinema. I love being scared and creeped out, because it's become a feeling that's hard to stimulate in these over saturated days.Well, Ju-on is nothing more than OK. It has great cinematography, but follows the formula too much. Too many clichéd edits to build the tension and release. Too campy ghosts and not enough of a strong story. It's all too much of a letdown, but the cinematography, and some quite inventive ideas make it watchable.But, you'd have to be stupid to find this scary. It's not. If anything, it's good chuckle-ride.",negative
"I recently went to see this movie on a whim, having never seen a trailer or having heard anything about it.I had no idea it was part of a series as it all made sense to me as a stand-alone film, but now I am confused:I see references to Ju-On: The Curse, Ju-On: The Curse 2, Ju-On: The Grudge, Ju-On: The Grudge 2, and at least one other ""version"" of one of these movies.So is this Part 4? I'd like to see the ones before it, but I get the idea that some of the installments before are more like expanded ""director's cuts."" Any Ju-On fans out there who can shed some light on this?",negative
"!!!!BEWARE SPOILERS DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!!!I loved this movie! It scared me. Really frightened me
I mean a lot of people have a problem with the fact that there is not much plot, or that there is no closure or explanation.People say it dosen't make any sense. I for one thinks it makes perfect sense. People died in a gruesome way, they come back as ghosts and kill everyone that crosses their paths. They torment and kill them.
Now I know that usually it's hard to be afraid when you can't identify with the character, and you can't identify with the characters if they aren't develloped. But in this case I think they were devellopped just enough. I mean the fact is that these people did nothing wrong or stupid or sinful to bring this curse on themselves. They didn't make sinful love in the attic of a spooky gothic house, they didn't watch a video tape after they have substantial proof that it might kill them, they didn't do a seance to attract ghosts.They just walked into the house. Boom they're doomed.I can really connect with that. These were ordinary people, going about their day and then they're cursed.And about closure!! What the hell do you need closure for. I mean that ending was killer. And it was killer because of it's complete absence of closure.You don't get some bookended thing where you know that, somehow everything is gonna be alright, or worse, that everything could've been alright if only...That's what is scary. You don't have to make a mistake to get that damn kid to give you a stare. You just need to cross their path.
For my part I was scared. More than I had ever been scared by a movie before. Still have chills thinking about it.It was great!",negative
"Having read other reviews of this film, I can see that opinions are mixed. However, I found this to be an almost uncomfortably tense viewing experience. Many people have critiscised it for lack of plot and the ambiguity of the spirits motivations - but who needs that? This is a film about the inexplicable. If you don't know why something's happening, isn't it more frightening? If something is evil without explanation, isn't it more deadly? The curse can't be reasoned with, pleaded with or stopped - and that is part of the fear factor of this film. Some viewers have also said that there is no hint given to the reason for the curse, yet at one point it is clearly stated that the father doubted the child was his, and bore a grudge. This at least explains the abused condition of the child on it's first discovery. Perhaps I'm way off the mark or perhaps some people weren't paying attention. My biggest critiscism is the one scene where the three schoolgirls become 'zombies' - this completely went against the tone of the film and was utterly cliched. Talking of cliches, the director utilises many, but he utilises them well (creaking stairs, well-placed shadows etc.). Admittedly, the acting is so-so, and there are a few unintentional giggles, but overall I felt this was a well-made, if low-budget feature. The film was relentless in it's tension, and I now have a fear of going into the attic. What's that noise?!",negative
"Take all the horror movies you've ever seen....minus a plot....minus interesting characters ( or character development altogether)....minus any sort of time line or storytelling at all....minus any sort of artistically original style....you have Ju On. By far the worst Horror movie experience I have had in the last while.... Completely clones the film making style of the ring (ringu) with less plot and less weird stuff to mess with your head( which is the only thing the ring had going for it...admit it or not..you didn't get the plot to the ring either..cuz there wasn't one)I don't think special FX would have helped at all..( for all those who praise this film for the lack of FX) But plot and characters help.... Its like a really really really bad Japanese ""twin peaks""If you have ever in your life seen a movie, and I mean any movie, skip this one..... I compare it to a thunderstorm....looks scary, sounds scary, begins abruptly and ends the same...but when you use your brain, even a little...you realize that it's just a bunch of random crappy visuals with no real terror backing it up...SO like I said, If you have never ever seen a movie and find yourself scared of your own shadow....you may get a kick out of this one... But if you like cinema and have a brain, you will be angry at the end of the film when you realize that you wasted your time on thrills you could have replicated by looking in the mirror and saying ""BOO!!"" I cant even believe they are making an American version...... watch how bad it gets bashed...watch...mark my words....if they don't put a plot into it.....critics will rape it... JB.",negative
"I love horror movies, I must have seen everything from the ""good ole"" slasher, cut 'em up movies to the classics. Though my all time favorite ""horror' films are the ones that just scare you, creep you out and give you that feeling of wondering what is behind that shower curtain, or what your going to see when you finally reach that light switch and turn on that light. It has been quite awhile since I have seen a good movie like that, actually it has been almost 20 years, when I saw ""The Changling"" that movie literally had me dreading to go into my house, my friends chose not to come inside and left me to face a large dark 2 story home alone. The Grudge, gave me that exact same feeling, I have seen all the installments of Ju-On and loved it. Without splitting hairs or making comparisons(which in my opinion is just WRONG, watch the movie and accept it as it is). The characters reactions are believable. The Grudge brings in the creepiness and scares just right. This film brings in just the right combination to well, maybe make you want to take a long look up the stairs before you go up and check that hallway a little more carefully. 4 stars out of 5",negative
"A good addition to the ever growing catalogue of Japanese horror. Saying this, I can't help notice the many similarities it shares with the Ring (I find myself saying this a lot about Japanese Horror movies, do writers like to use it as a basis for all latter projects?!) notably the 'cursed girl', who, like most Japanese 'ghost girls' have very long hair, covering most or the entirety of their faces, and walk or crawl after their victims in a weird fashion. That aside, the movie was unusually fast paced for a Japanese horror in my opinion, with suspense building in almost every scene. Although relying on music too much to build up the suspense it manages to chill, scare and make you jump often enough. All in all the best Japanese horror movie I have seen in a while, ranking higher than the Tomie series and Spiral but not quite living up to the likes of Dark Water and The Ring. 7.5/10",positive
"Ju-on: The Grudge is a VERY creepy movie - the story isn't that good but it doesn't matter, because the movie itself is so DAMN scary. Ju-on delivers horror constantly and gives you no time to catch your breath. While some horror films rely on cheap shock tactics or gore to get their chills, ""Ju-On"" relies almost entirely on the unbearable sense of dread that it creates and sustains right up until the very end.After watching this movie I had my first nightmare in years - nothing compares to Ju-on: The Grudge.",positive
"What you've seen in the trailer are almost all the scary scenes of the movie, and what's annoying is the (like creaking door) when there is some scary scene, but still I like the movie even though it's not as scary as other horror movies. it's just that loud creaking door sound that makes it???",positive
"Wow!  Very freaky.  The use of sound and some of the messed up images will remain with you long after the movie's end.  It's been a week now and I can't get it out of my head.  This movie ruins every security blanket you ever had for yourself including putting your hands over your eyes and hiding under the covers.  This movie has done nothing short of affecting my daily life for a solid week now.  Especially if I'm alone for more than two seconds.I chose to see this one first out of the series and I'm not sure if that was good or bad.  As a result, I had a really hard time following the plot, but it was terrifying none-the-less.  The sounds they used were great and I was pleased with the whole production.  The way they would flash the next victim's name on the screen made for a great build up.  I would definitely recommend this one for the die hard horror watchers.  I would not recommend this to someone who thinks it's going to be a little cream puff of a movie...you'd never be the same.",positive
"What are you talking about when you say the movie was ""not that good""??I mean I've seen an awful lot of horrormovies, but this was a new level in horror genre!! I watched it at night and though a friend had already told me that i was going to die, I couldn't quite believe it. But then I was already screaming like a baby after only 10 mins....Well, I also didn't understand the Plot but that didn't matter...it still scared me to death.I'd like to know from those who didn't like the movie that much: have you seen any creepier movies than this? and which ones?",negative
"I had heard about this film awhile ago but never could find it anywhere. I colleague of mine loaned me his copy on DVD over the weekend. I like suspenseful, horror films that make you think. But I was not prepared for Ju-on. I must say I was scared out of my mind! I made the mistake of watching this alone late at night by myself. It was so creepy that I couldn't go to sleep afterwards! This is one truly, scary film. Not too gory, but suspenseful enough to keep you awake looking over your shoulder all night. At one point when one of the characters is running from a ghost in her home and seeks refuge in the comforts of her bed, this turns out to be a big mistake for her! At that point I almost lost it! I screamed so loud I'm sure my neighbors thought I was getting murder or something. If you like being scared then this is the film for you. Even though it's subtitled, there is minimal dialogue and easy to follow. The score still, dare I say it, haunts me. But whatever you do make sure you do not have a full bladder and do not watch this film alone!",negative
"Most of you who have seen ""The Ring"" (or to some its original Ringu) probably have been swallowed into the Japanese Horror movie fad (Audition, Chakushin Ari, Shikoku, etc;) after watching it. Then we have .....Ju-onThis series came about originally as a two-part TV movie in Japan.Two theatrical versions were brought to the public afterwards. In October of 2004 another Ju-on titled ""The Grudge"" (which is supposedly a pseudo-retelling of this movie) will be shown in theaters.Here the first theatrical release added depth to make the original story behind it seem stronger. Basically the plot behind this is a curse that haunts a home in Japan. Anyone who becomes involved with the house is trapped within the curse's grip, and one by one the characters (or victims) seem confused and have no idea what will happen to them until its too late at least towards the end with an unsuspected ending that leaves you asking yourself ""Why does it have to end here?""This film gets really creepy and the first couple of times I had watched this I had a little trouble sleeping. The actors really get you into their emotions so you can relate to their fears. The direction is very unique by setting the film into segments/chapters. But I'm pretty sure you are most curious of what lurks in this curse, Toshio and Kayako. The idea of creating these horrifying figures is very creative which is unusual in what you would find in most horror films of today. The sound effects and music were greatly used as well in this movie. However there are some weak points in this film but its not really noticeable.If you want gore you'll see some of it but its no slasher flick at all. This movie's intent is to psychologically warp your mind with a little bit of confusion and a ton of suspense. All in all the movie is worth giving a try since people's fears can vary with this film, meaning it could or could not be scary. Do not think of this as a cursed videotape that kills you in seven days.",positive
"The grudge is the most predictable piece of sh!t I've ever seen in my entire life,not to mention just a plain piece of Sh!t. The sequel wasn't any better either. I found Toshio too cute to find frightening in anyway. The angry spirit looked like she was covered in chalk powder, rather than looking ghostly.There was a ridiculous amount of mood music that was probably inserted to make up for all the plot holes, endless repetition and lack of gore.I don't know what the f00cking big deal is about this movie.I'm hoping it's not the best that Japanese cinema has to offer/I 've seen ""gozu"", an award winning Japanese film and I'm pretty sure that the only point of that movie was to confuse the sh!t out of viewers because all it was was a bunch of weird ass events stuck together. Believe me i tried to look deep in myself for some philosophical message to it but settled that no, maybe its just a piece of Sh!t. It was sickening. Words can't describe the extent of horridness of this movie is so I'm not gonna make nay more attempts.",negative
"Is it just me, or does the Japanese film industry make films so confusing you have to see them a hundred times to understand the plot. Perhaps its a secret ploy to make money out of people. Then again, maybe it is just me. So far i've been left totally confused at Akira, Ghost In The Shell, just about every other anime in my boyfriends collection, The Ring and most recently Ju-on: The Grudge only yesterday.What drove me to watch Ju-on: The Grudge was an advert for it's American adaptation. It looked pretty good. I initially thought it was an advert for 'The Ring 2' what with the trademark ghosty girlies with long black hair covering half of their face. Then i saw Sarah Michelle Geller and thought it pretty weird for her to take lead role in the film. Then saw it wasn't 'The Ring' - it was 'The Grudge'. It actually looked quite good. Later that day we saw the original Japanese version and bought it, thinking how clever we were. When we got home we put it in the DVD player and watched it. Just like when we watched 'The Ring', i was constantly asking who was who and trying to get my head around the plot. No matter how much i thought about it, i just couldn't understand quite what was going on. When i thought i did, something happened that totally confused me again. It reminded me of watching 'The Matrix' and 'Donnie Darko' which confused me equally (and also had a massive cult following for some reason.)At this precise moment in time, i'm searching for the plot on the internet. I'm sure that when i find it, it'll all come together nicely and i'll feel dumb for not understanding it in the first place.",negative
"the American version of 'the grudge' looks very interesting so i was rather excited to see the original Japanese movie. but, it was a big disappointment. the storyline is so hacked up that at the end, instead of being genuinely spooked, you are more likely to say, ""what the hell?"" there were too many plot holes to make the movie enjoyable. the special effects were pretty good, but it didn't make up for the fact that the rest of the movie was mediocre. 'ju-on' had definite 'ringu' feelings all over it and like it's predecessor, it did not please very well. i should have been scared by the creepy murdered mother and child who kept scratching his knees, but i spent my time laughing at how ridiculous this movie was.",negative
"this movie's main purpose is to scare you, and I think it served its purpose. It creeped me out from the beginning to end. The part I don't like was when the dead wife crawled down the stairs.... But it would have been more enjoyable if the movie revealed the origin of the curse( it does, but very vaguely.) and why the curse is affecting everyone that steps into that house. I wasn't disappointed with the movie, but kind of confused, only because I didn't understand the ending to the movie. How did Rika become the Grudge? Or was she the Grudge the whole time? I think I have to watch this movie again, and go out and buy Ju-on: The Grudge part 2. Maybe it will make sense to me then. LOL (^^)",positive
"I saw Ju-on the grudge recently and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of renting the Japanese version very soon.Why is everyone always looking for plots. A good horror movie is made to scare you. Plots help make prequels and sequels of movies (eg: the Exorcist) but the original should be terrifying enough to make people want to come back for more.Japanese directors and story makers do an excellent job with horror movies. I'm glad that Hollywood is making more movies like the Japanese ones. And needless to say, the movies are doing very well. I certainly enjoyed the Ring and Ju-on. If you get a thrill from horror movies and don't like wasting time analyzing them, then Ju-on is the movie for you.",negative
"This is an incredible horror film. Scares you without all the gore of American horror films. This Japanese masterpiece is must see. You can easily rank it up there with the likes of The Exorcist and The Ring. The Ring by the way is the American remake of Ringu. And the makers of Ringu also made Ju-on. I can also recommend the American version of Ju-on. The Grudge starring Sarah Michelle Gellar is a creepy, well made film. Don't watch Ju-on alone. Don't watch Ju-on alone in the dark. It will make you look back over your shoulder with every strange noise you hear in the dark. Chills abound with this awesome film. Check it out. I give it a rating of 10 out of 10! EXCELLENT FILM!!",positive
"i saw this movie just today because we stumbled across it at the video store. the movie was hard to follow in my opinion. it went from person to person without really saying why ""the grudge"" was going after people. it never explained how or why the people in the beginning were killed. it also really confused me when the father came in in the last scene and reached for rika. i think that it would have been scarier had they explained more things. there wasn't even anyone who figured out any way to stop it or even anyone who tried. it also seemed like they kept some characters alive for a long time, while others were killed right off the bat. also, it was confusing that sometimes that little boy looked alive and then other times he didn't, When they showed the pictures of izumi and her friends, their eyes were blacked out and they never explained that either. this movie was very unsatisfying, and i hope that the American version answers some of these questions.",negative
"I was not expecting much from this movie after hearing the reviews from the States. All I wanted was a few frights here and there, but I severely underestimated The Grudge - I got more than I bargained for! I was absolutely terrified from start to finish, then not wanting to be, was last out of the cinema due to jelly leg syndrome! The story line was fantastic and easy to follow, but the characters were what made it so real. That freaky women and stealth boy have not left my thoughts since! This will hit home to anyone who has experienced 'the other side'. I can still hear that noise in my head that gave you warning when the grudge was on approach - if you have seen it you know the one - it is unforgettable. Can't wait to see this movie again one day when the goose bumps disappear...!",positive
I enjoyed this film. It was entertaining and quite spooky in places. Despite what some people have said here I think they just didn't watch the film closely enough to understand/comprehend what was being portrayed.If you are a fan of Japanese horror movies then this is an enjoyable film and much much better than the American remake!!!SpoilersBasically a family died/were killed and there was heightened emotions at the time of death so their spirits have stayed on and the grudge so to speak is repeating itself.In regards to one persons comment that no one tried to stop it the police officer who investigated the original murders did try to but was killed by the grudge before he could burn down the house. He also had a vision of his daughter in the future visiting the house while he was attempting to burn it down.... which was taken on slightly differently for the American remake of the film.,negative
"contrary to some comment posted here, JUON was never made as a TV movie. it was a Japanese film. Made with real film, not video. the same is true for JUON 2 I don't know about JUON 3 as it was in pre-production while I was in Japan. I assure you all, these films were released in theaters in Japan well before VHS (which still often comes out well before DVD in Japan..) and long before it was ever broadcast on TV! If you don't speak and understand Japanese, you won't understand the film really. I watched it with no subtitling. The concept of JUON doesn't translate easily into English. I don't know if Shimizu's American version does it. Haven't' seen it yet. but his style is almost expressly visual and timing. dialogue doesn't form the stock of his soup in Juon. Juon 2 is different. it tries to explain Juon and expands the territory (not unlike the first sequel to any 80's American slasher film, including nightmare on elmstreet which shows some influence here) but much of the visual style and movement is based in the traditions of Japanese ghost stories as told in Japanese traditional theater and puppet shows and in illustrated stories. the original and part 2 are well worth viewing a few times.",negative
"I never seen this kind movie, actually you do not seen exact figure of the ghost. The spiritual fear of unknown factor is more create fear. You may seen few movement of the ghost which makes trigger to more fear by your imagination. When you are entering the Forrest deeply in the midnight alone, you have same factor of fear, you do not seen but, all your six senses try to catch the something in the darkness. Japanese version called Ju-on, is more fear. The Spiritual fear is existing in the nature. As you see at present, the city covered by lights and noises and yourself. When you stand alone in the nature, you bear and fill the fear of something. The tree, rocks, water, shadow, air anything in there. The grudge, this case in the house.",positive
"OK now I'm not going to rant too badly on this , but I think that Ju-on deserves more credit then most are giving it. I've seen both Ju-on and Ju-on 2 in the original Japanese format, and both are quiet good. The second one is a great deal freakier then the third, since about twice the amount of people are killed and there is a lot more shock scenes. The thing that makes these movies truly terrifying IS that the antagonists ARE REALISTIC... and NORMAL. The idea that something so gruesome and unbelievable could happen an everyday person creeps the heck out of people. Having a looming darkness follow you where ever you go, having to look over you shoulder and having the hairs rise of the back of you neck... the primal human fear of being followed by something you can't see or do anything about, this is what Ju-on incorporates and thrives on. Ju-on is an awesome horror movie, since it is an actual *horror* film, not a slasher in which nothing is believable. ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre does not count as a believable slasher.... sorry folks) On an ending note: Ju-on and it's sequel are written by the same author as Ringu and Ringu ni (2), and from what I can tell Ju-on ni (2) is the lead in for Ringu.",positive
"I beg to disagree with you dear critics, this is an excellent film for those who can fully appreciate this genre. OK,if your taste buds are tuned for straight forward American horror only, do not bother. Otherwise sit back and enjoy a creepy tale which unravels slowly but surely. All the characters and story lines merge together nicely and nothing is explained away in an easy manner. The sound effects are brilliant and really enhance this movie. You will love this movie if you appreciate films such as ' A tale of two sisters', and ' Audition'. I would recommend this for anyone who would like to see how it is done before Hollywood gets hold of these tales.",positive
"Many people frown over the order in which the Ju-on series goes in as there are so many of these films around and there are forever being remade. The first instalment in the series was Ju-on, followed up by Ju-on 2. The third in the series was Ju-on: The Grudge (the review you're reading up at the moment) and the fourth being Ju-on: The Grudge 2. The final instalment is due out some time this year and is titled Ju-on: The Grudge 3. However there was also an American remake of this film made in 2004, ""The Grudge"", with the sequel ""The Grudge 2"" due out in 2006.The story plot is about a ""JU-ON"", a curse born of a grudge held by someone who dies in the grip of powerful angers. It gathers in the places frequented by that person in life, working its spell on those who come into contact with it and thus creating itself anew.Nishina Rika is a social worker sent to a home in order to check up on its inhabitants. There she finds an old woman wrought in silent terror amongst dishevelled, stained sheets. While attempting to clean up the house, Rika hears noises coming upstairs and discovers a boy named Toshio duct taped inside one of the room closets. This starts off the chain of events that would soon be known as the JU-ON curse, passing through those who would come into contact with this mysterious, dark residence.The film follows a series of deaths of people living amongst the curse. At times the film can be quite confusing and all over the place and it can be quite hard at times to keep track of the characters due to it being in Japanese. It isn't really a film that you would immediately watch again straight after you had watched it the first time but i would recommend that you watch it twice (that is, if you enjoyed it the first time) to try and develop better understanding and knowledge of the characters featured in the film. As well as the confusion with the characters there is also a part near the end that involves a man in a wheelchair which i didn't understand the first time i saw the film.I won't say anymore but I certainly enjoyed this unique film and I would recommend it to anyone into horror films.",positive
"i think that this film is much better and more exciting than the remake. although Sarah Michelle Geller is a very good actress and plays the part well, i feel that the original version is much much better. the new grudge goes on for a bit to long and i get scared at films easily and this one this not scare me at all, the original grudge had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. i am a great fan of Japenese thriller/horror films and this one is definitely a good film to watch, there are great use of camera angles and positioning to get the angles just right. they use the right amount of closeups to see the emotion on there faces and also there is great use of props, makeup and costume. i'd recommend this film to anyone with a strong stomach.",positive
"This is the movie without horror, there is no story, no acting and even no feeling of fear in there acting. I just gave 2 stars for the acting of the boy and mother",negative
A must watch if you are looking for some adrenaline rush.,positive
"I just didn't get all of the stuff going on! K here's the deal... I've seen both The Grudge and Ju-On. I thought both were alright, but the thing with Ju-On is that i don't understand whats going on with all the school girls, and the girl who had all the newspaper all over her window! the plot is kinda confusing and i really didn't understand thoese parts! Neither did my BF and he's a pretty big movie buff and even understands some of the most confusing movies ever! Is it maybe easier to understand if you've seen all of the Ju-On series?? I would like to understand it better so if anyone could enlighten me....So does anyone else know whats going on with those parts??? Please answer if you do! it would be appriciated!",negative
