"This one started it all: the first and original Godzilla (Gojira) movie, and also serves as the beginning to a long line of sci-fi and monster (kaiju in Japan) movies from Toho Studios. We have a story where Japan is thrown into a panic after several ships explode and sink. An expedition of law enforcement officials and lead scientist Dr. Yamane (Takeshi Shimura) head to nearby Odo Island to investigate. There, a legendary mythical creature called Gojira, alleged to be responsible for the ship disasters, make his first appearance and begins a rampage on hapless Tokyo, threatening all of mankind. This dramatic film with its thrills and horror has all the monster movie elements: a fire-breathing creature, toppling buildings, wall of flames, fleeing and screaming citizens, storms and seas, tanks and the army and frantic scientists and government officials - trying to figure out how to defeat the horror they see before them. The love triangle between the character leads blends in very well with the monster plot. Godzilla, making his first attack on Tokyo, created haunting scenes of death and destruction and poignant moments of dismalness in the aftermath of his wake. Director Ishiro Honda did his finest and composer Akira Ifukube scored one of his best film music masterpieces. A compelling story by Shigeru Kayama, marvelous screenplay by Takeo Murata and superb special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Actors Takeshi Shimura, Akira Takarada, Momoko Kochi and Akihiko Hirata gave outstanding performances. And, Haruo Nakajima, Katsumi Tezuka and Ryosaku Takasugi did a terrific and realistic job on portraying Godzilla.It is clever that the grave consequences of atomic bomb testings are depicted in this film, which sends a vital message to the real world. This is a creative way to explain Godzilla's origins. Every element in this movie are throughly connected, leaving no room for loose ends and plot holes. While the plot's pace is steady, all the on-scream drama and action will grab the audience's attention. Above all, this film is not just a ""monster-on-the-loose"" movie. It's a true classic, one that stands out above many sci-fi movies in cinema history. A great movie to begin a long and successful (in most cases) line of Godzilla and other monster/sci-fi films from Toho Studios. Grade A",positive
"The original, Japanese version of ""Gojira"" is the best giant monster film I've ever seen. Some fans get carried away and call it one of the best movies ever made; I wouldn't go quite that far, but it's damn good.This film is quite different from the 20+ sequels that followed. Here, Godzilla is not so much a creature as he is a walking incarnation of the atomic bomb. His death ray, which became a rather amusing cartoon laser blast in later films, is here depicted as a sort of radioactive mist that sets its victims on fire. These ""radioactive horror"" images still resonate today - and imagine the impact they must've had on Japanese audiences fifty years ago.From a production standpoint, the film holds up well. Godzilla's costume is much more convincing than the silly monkey suits that featured in the 60s and 70s Toho films, and due to the grayscale photography, the model cityscapes look convincing in most shots - or at least respectable. Ifkube's music score is stirring (you know it has to be good, as they kept recycling it in later movies), and director Honda makes great use of camera angles and imaginative special effects to give Godzilla a genuine aura of menace. For once, the human characters don't let the side down. There's a compelling love triangle, and a dramatic sacrifice made at the end of the film that adds enormously to its emotional impact. The American version (""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"") cut out much of the character development, and is thus clearly inferior; but never fear, Rialto is apparently releasing ""Gojira,"" in all its original glory, sometime this year (2004).In the later Godzilla films, the destruction he causes is almost incidental. Here, it's the whole point - he's a force of nature. Impressive.",positive
"Finally, I had the pleasure of finally seeing the original Japanese version of this classic and I have to say that it is much better than the ""Raymond Burr"" version. This film pretty much makes one think about what we are doing to mother Earth with all the pollution and war going on. Perhaps the thing that made this film great was that not only did it have great effects, but it also had a great story that made a great social commentary on what could have happened if the arms race continued to go unchecked. Besides the story about Gojira, you also had a pretty decent love story. Akihiko Hirata, does a good job of playing Serizawa, who is really the tragic figure in this film who must decide whether or not to use his weapon, which potentially was more dangerous than the monster itself. This film is definitely one of the all time classics and fortunately the original version will be released on DVD in September 2006.",negative
"Along with the 1933-version of ""King Kong"", this original Japanese release of ""Gojira"" is THE most essential giant monster movie ever and one the very few horror movies that every film lover in general has to see at least once. Why? Because, it's so much more than just silly drive-in cinema with a cheap looking monster! This is dark and apocalyptic Sci-Fi with a nearly allegorical rant about nuclear warfare and the honest fear for new types of weaponry. But I really don't feel like going into the deeper meaning behind ""Gojira"", as it primarily is an adrenalin rushing and overpowering action classic that doesn't need intellectual defense at all. One of the many reasons why I love this film so much (and same goes for ""King Kong"") is that we don't have to wait a dreadfully long time and/or endure a large amount of tedious speeches before we see the monster we want to see! Godzilla makes his highly memorable first appearance after approximately 20 minutes (by stretching his neck over a cliff!) and, from then on, this is deliciously hectic and paranoid monster-madness! The little bugger is presumably the result of too much H-bomb radiation and lives in the depths of the ocean, near the island of Odo. But now he's heading for Tokyo with his unnameable strength, fiery breath and  oh yeah  insatiable appetite for destruction! Particularly this extended sequence in which Godzilla blasts his way through the Japanese capital, crushing buildings and setting monuments on fire, is very impressive and legendary. The actor-in-monster-costume works a lot better than any form of computer engineered effects and the carefully imitated Tokyo sets are truly enchanting. The absolute best aspect about this production is its powerful score, which makes Godzilla even more threatening. Great stuff! This milestone simultaneously meant the go-ahead for an innumerable amount of quickly shot sequels (""Son of Gozilla"", ""Godzilla vs. Mothra""), spin-offs (""Godzilla VS. King Kong""), remakes (""Godzilla 1984"", the hi-tech American version) and of course an overload of pathetic imitations (""Reptilicus"", ""Monster from a Prehistoric Planet""). I still have to see all the direct sequels but don't really know what to expect from them. I guess that even if they're only half as good as this original, I'll be very satisfied.",positive
"When one thinks of all the schlock that has come out of Japan when it comes to monster movies, many which use the Godzilla figure, one forgets that this was a pretty darn good movie. I remember as a child, watching it on late night television, in 1960. It was New Year's Eve and the adults were out doing whatever it is they did. The presence of Raymond Burr gave me a sense of comfort (Perry Mason was a staple at our house). I realize he was added for American audiences. It didn't matter to me. Unlike so many of its successors, this was nicely paced, didn't bank on Godzilla being a matinée idol (some of the films are so stupid where the thing becomes a friend to Tokyo, a form of defense). This film has the terror of ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" The sets were much better. The battle scenes truer than the cheaper things that came later. The monster was a force. I have always enjoyed that scene where one goes over a hill or a rise just before a beach, and on the other side is the monster. The scenes of him wading into the harbor. This is a striking presentation for the early days of monster movies. Of course, it's all based on radiation and the nuclear threat. This stuff enlarges things and makes them rampage. I hope to purchase the Japanese remastered version from 2004. I'd like to see it the way it was intended to be seen.",positive
"A film that works because of its campy monster and its budget-limited special effects (they couldn't afford stop motion so it's all a dude wearing a rubber suit tromping on miniatures), but is made special because of its deep meaning and the warnings and questions it has for the nuclear age.It's telling that it was the most advanced scientific breakthrough made by the most brilliant minds on the planet, the harnessing of the atom, that led to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in turn, in this movie, to the unleashing of a two million year old monster. It warns humanity that in stepping forward in its understanding of the universe, it was also taking a step backwards, and unleashing irrational, destructive violence upon the world. That's all pretty obvious I guess, but the scenes of fleeing people being incinerated by Godzilla, women and children huddling together in fear, and the destruction of Tokyo looking like an atomic bomb had gone off must have reverberated especially with the original audiences of the time. It certainly did for me. There is something deeply painful about this film.In a fascinating development, it's a Japanese scientist who has to wrestle with the morality of having developed a weapon of mass destruction called the 'Oxygen Destroyer', knowing that its use to stop Godzilla in the short term may lead to its use to further horrific destruction in the long term. It seems to put the Japanese in the same position as the Americans in 1945, one where there are no easy answers. How does one put the lid back on the box of an arms race, where one technology or act of violence leads to another in a crazy, unending spiral? The solution offered may or may not be all that realistic, but I thought just raising the question in the way the film did - and so soon after the war - was incredibly thought-provoking and brave. The film thus works on emotional and philosophical levels that one normally wouldn't get in a monster film, or at least, with this level of meaning and intensity. Definitely recommended.",positive
"When seventeen vessels blow-up and sink nearby Odo Island, Professor Kyohei Yamane (Takashi Shimura), his daughter Emiko Yamane (Momoko Kôchi), and the marine officer Hideto Ogata (Akira Takarada) head to the island to investigate. Soon they witness a giant monster called Gojira by the locals destroying the spot. Meanwhile Emiko meets her boyfriend, the secluded scientist Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), and he makes she promise to keep a secret about his research with oxygen. She agrees and he discloses the lethal weapon Oxygen Destroyer that he had developed. When Gojira threatens Tokyo and other Japanese cities and the army and the navy are incapable to stop the monster, Emiko discloses Serizawa´s secret to her lover Ogata. Now they want to convince Serizawa to use the Oxygen Destroyer to stop Gojira.""Gojira"" (1954) is a surprisingly good Godzilla film, with well-developed story, screenplay and characters. Despite the dated effects and the behavior of Emiko, the plot is engaging and holds the attention of the viewer to the last scene. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Godzilla""",positive
"Pure classic sci-fi horror monster! I don't know how they made some of it seem so real, it's a wild gritty epic gargantua. The destruction was done so well and the emotions were admirable!",positive
"Yes, I have seen the rather cheesy Americanized version of this film with the obviously inserted Raymond Burr scenes and while you do get to see Godzilla crush Tokyo you miss most the the plot from the original Japanese version. The Japanese version is very well done and has a very good story, which for some reason we felt like changing. I don't know why, there really isn't any overtly anti-American messages to be found, rather a message against Japan's own nuclear testing and the dangers of said weapon to all people. So suffice to say this movie has a giant monster who comes out of the ocean, apparently a dinosaur that was entrapped in some underwater area where it remained undetected for millions of years...a nuclear test has not only released the beast it has horribly mutated it as well to a much bigger radioactive super beast. So scientist and military and politicians must now find a way to destroy the beast before it destroys all of Japan. The movie is very good and rather sad at the same time. The sweeping march on Tokyo is very well done as there is a rather good scene of a mother with her children surrounded by flames trying to comfort her kids by saying they will be with their father soon. Also a very good ending and very sad ending. It is also an ending in the Japanese version that warns that other Godzilla's may emerge and indeed they do as the next Godzilla to emerge would actually never be killed and end up being somewhat of a hero, kind of funny they did turn one of the most effective destructive monsters scarred by radiation into a hero, however I liked those Godzilla movies as well.",positive
"Essentially a Japanese remake of Hollywood's 1953 classic 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms', 'Gojira' took the same formula and became so much more than simple giant-monster entertainment.Both films told stories about a pre-historic creature released/mutated by atomic testing. 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' followed the appearance of a dinosaur released by an atomic blast. This dinosaur proceeded to destroy some stuff, turned up in New York, and destroyed New York too. Fun, but that was it, and not much more (I'm not saying its a bad film).On the other hand, 'Gojira' used the same idea, and had a great impact in Japan. Gojira represented a real threat, a danger that Japanese of the time knew all too well. The message behind 'Gojira' was warning of the dangers of nuclear testing and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the message of 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' is one for aspiring comic-book writers: exposure to radiation is a cheap but easy way to explain your character's freaky superpowers.'Gojira' starts off with several boats going missing. One old man claims that Godzilla has returned, and in surprisingly un-Godzilla movie like fashion, no one believes him. I can understand this, Japan wasn't accustomed to giant-monster attacks yet. Anyway, Japan asks an imminent paleontologist, Dr. Yamane, to investigate the disappearances around Ohto Island. He discovers a two-million year old shellfish and lots of radiation. Oh, and a dinosaur the locals have dubbed Gojira. Back in Japan, Dr. Yamane is convinced that Gojira has been released by atomic testing, and that it should be isolated and studied. Obviously, no one else shares his view, and they all look for a way to destroy Gojira.The key to Gojira's destruction lies in the hands of Dr. Serizawa. You can tell he is mad scientist because of his eye-patch. He is arranged to be married to Emiko Yamane, but she is in love with Hideto Ogata, a naval officer. Meanwhile, Gojira is turning Tokyo into a fiery crater.Story-wise, its pretty similar to any irradiated monster movie of the 1950s. However, what all the other movies lack is the gripping images of destruction. Gojira is depicted as an evil force of nature - instead of wanting to see cities get crushed, we see Tokyo in Gojira's wake: it resembles a nuclear wasteland, and then we are treated to hospital scenes where medical staff try their best to deal with the scores of Gojira's victims. I can only imagine how terrifying scenes like those would have been so soon after World War Two. These are scenes we don't to see, in contrast to the sheer joy of watching two giant monsters have at each other in a big metropolis with no apparent consequences (see: nearly every other Godzilla movie ever made, for starters) Interestingly enough, Godzilla was only 50 metres tall in this, and he left radioactive fallout wherever he went. Somewhere along the along the line in the following movies, he got significantly taller, and lost the radioactive fallout. I guess it was a good career move seeing as he wanted to become a super-hero later on.Great film, worthy of a 10/10",positive
"American nuclear weapons testing results in the creation of a seemingly unstoppable, dinosaur-like beast.Sadly, I saw the American version of this film before I saw the Japanese. This may not be uncommon, but is incredibly unfortunate -- the monster appears slower in the original Japanese version, which builds more suspense, and the plot is much deeper. Say what you will about deeper meaning in film, but there is much more of a message in the original, which is what makes it the classic it is.This version also actually features the Japanese cast rather than trying to minimize their participation. As silly as it sounds with a story based in Tokyo, the American version tried its best to remove these characters and still tell the tale.",positive
"The original Japanese version of Godzilla is a breathtaking classic. A giant monster is awaken by the over abundance of nuclear radiation and goes on a rampage across Japan. What follows is an unforgettable experience that stands as the greatest giant monster film of all time, if one does not count King Kong that is.Japan was best fit to make a film about the effects of nuclear radiation since they had experience the atomic bomb first hand nearly a decade earlier. It was a powerful statement for the time. I really wish more people would give this movie a chance and realize how smart it is.Besides the powerful message, the film is best known for its pioneering special effects. Yes, by today's standards, the suits and miniatures are pretty archaic. But they still look great over sixty years later. The destruction that Godzilla causes is both exciting and horrifying. Few monster movies have the emotion and smarts that this one has. Of course, their is the monster himself. What a sight. The design has changed greatly over the years but this one is the most iconic of course. The menacing eyes, roar and towering size make him a sight to behold. I highly recommend checking out the behind the scenes features that talk about the making of the famous suit, it's really interesting.Then there's the most underrated part of the movie, the cast. Most Godzilla fans will recognize Akira Takarada as the lead. He's very good here and would continue to Star in the series for many years. The biggest name here is Takashi Shimura. He's of course best known for appearing in several Akira Kurosawa classics such as Seven Samurai and Ikiru.Godzilla gets a bad rep because of some mediocre to atrocious sequels with some gems here and there. But the original stands above them like a atomic breath breathing monster. Godzilla is essential cinema that can be enjoyed for many different reasons.",positive
"A freighter is sunk by an unknown force. A second ship is sent but is also sunk. Three survivors are pulled from the sea but the fishing boat also sinks. An elderly villager claims that it is the work of the legendary sea monster Godzilla. On Odo island, a giant storm swamps the village and giant footprints are found to be radioactive. Dr. Yamane postulates that Godzilla had been driven out of his underground cavern by repeated H-bomb testing. Godzilla advances on Tokyo despite the Japanese armed forces and an electric fence.The special effects are very effective especially considering the time. There is no hiding the miniatures but they are generally done well. The production is relatively big for a monster movie. And Godzilla's roar is second to none. It's great to see the model planes fire little rockets like fireworks at Godzilla. It even has a compelling message. It's a fine B-movie that deserves its iconic status.",positive
"Trying to convince somebody that isn't wholly invested in cinema, or somebody simply not willing to learn about the culture, that the first Godzilla film was actually a film littered with commentary and played nothing like the idea we all have in our heads about the towering monster is a daunting and almost thankless task in itself. Once you grasp the idea of a postwar Japan that was left demilitarized and financially and structurally battered, fearful of invaders, nuclear repercussions, and the country's future in terms of basic economic prosperity, the original, 1954 Japanese film (known as Gojira in Japanese) becomes a film ripe for thoughtful dissection and analysis by just your average cinephile or history buff.Little needs to be explained in the way of the film's story, I feel, but the basic idea concerns the awakening of a towering behemoth thanks to prolific nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese are petrified of the destruction possible with this creature lurking around, find their government is content on hiding and obscuring facts related to the issue, and see a dissenting country in the mix of deciding what to do with the monster. While a good majority of the people, understandably, want this monster extinct and destroyed as soon as possible, Dr. Yamane Emiko (Momoko Kōchi) finds the possibility for research and analysis on Godzilla invaluable and has the ambition to try and capture him alive. Dr. Emiko is in the minority on this view, but he sees the long-term value in the creature, while the townspeople, acting on impulse and responding to an immediate conception of fear, want nothing to do with the creature.This ignites an idea brought on by classic Universal monster movies of the 1930's and 1940's about humans' role in these man-made disasters, or whether or not humans have the responsibility to ""play God"" in any way. This idea, in conjunction with relativistic looks at the Japanese mindset in the 1940's and 1950's, after the repercussions of World War II, the basic elements of human fear, and what Godzilla metaphorically represents, are all relative in analyzing this particular piece, and it may indeed be the only franchise where the first film is looked at and critiqued in an entirely different light than its successors. Following the boom of the Japanese film industry in the 1950's and 1960's, American activities such as golf were beginning to become prominent in Japan, along with the ubiquity of home Television sets, which saw exponential sales from a few thousands to two million during the mid to late 1960's. As a result, Japan's successful film industry became short-lived, as less and less people flocked out to the theaters due to the lack of popularity of the establishments comparative to the United States. The company that released Gojira, Toho and its director Ishirō Honda, began catering to the lowest common-denominator, not filling their follow-up efforts to Godzilla with thought-provoking commentary on Japanese culture and topical events, but instead, loading them with the kind of cheesiness and glitz expected to attract young children or a late-night audience. The Godzilla films became more concerned with the sounds-and-lights aesthetic, ridiculous and often ludicrous monsters that were totally geared towards selling action figures, and a line of comic books and video games to license the everlasting hell out of Godzilla name.This kind of franchise and international ubiquity obscured the original film not only for its datedness but made its justifications for social commentary laughable to those uninformed about Japanese culture at the time . This is one of the many things licensing does to hurt a brand or product in the long-term sense, for it alienates consumers because they can't seem to escape it no matter which way they turn, but the reasons for the greatness of the original product become lessened or forgotten due to the constant influx of new material related to the original work.Gojira may find itself crude in parts, with its assembly of miniatures optimistically passing off as a rogue monstrosity devastating a large community, or its evident aspects showcasing overacting, but it's nonetheless enjoyable on an entertainment level and thoughtful on a commentary-level. This is one of the few films that can be so relevant and topical while playing one of the most simplistic but effective instrumental tracks, and that in its own right is uncommonly beautiful. Starring: Akira Takarada, Momoko Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata, and Takashi Shimura. Directed by: Ishirō Honda.",positive
"Gozilla has always been a figure in my childhood and was the first monster in film I've ever seen, I remember when I was 7 the concept of a big monster rolling in to destroy your hometown kinda terrified me, who the heck wouldn't be afraid of something as big as a dinosaur trying to destroy you. But at the same time couldn't help but be amazed at the same time because your seeing something big just tear down structures that over tower you, there's something strangely gratifying about that. This film was the first and in my book is still the best, it's also one of my favorite movies in general.Despite how old this version is, I still think it's holds up the best because it's doing it's own thing and back then it was never sought to be a franchise. Here this is a straight forward sci-fi horror that pretty much fits in with a long line of the sci-fi in the 50's like ""The Thing from Another World"" and many others back when there were Movie Drive Ins (damn I miss them).Everything about this film for me is great, I do love the special effects because their practical. I really liked the construction of the miniatures, you buy that their the actual buildings. Well OK, in some places you can tell one or two are miniatures, same could be said even in the latter films but I feel in a strange way that's part of the film's charm, giving it an almost a small light hearted sensibility let alone at least with the miniature they tried, much like in the effects for those amateur web series like ""Video Game High School"".However I really like the destruction effects which are very cool because like I sad practical, all those models/miniatures that you see blown away are all real pyrotechnics.But the main attraction is Godzilla himself whom doesn't disappoint and still doesn't to this day, I really like the old design of the costume, the make up affects I thought were fantastic, he looks shaped almost like and looks a bit like a T-Rex but with reptilian features to make him unique enough and stand out on his own. He's both really cool but at the same time really menacing where one look at him could make anyone almost nervous.And the features like the growl which to this day still would shake anyones boots, there is almost a strange emotional sensibility about it as it seems like a growl of angry but also immense pain which almost gives the creature a sympathetic sensibility. And just seeing him just deconstruct Tokyo is a lot of fun and a bit scary at the same time, the fun of seeing him destroy the city is almost like how any kid would play with building blocks building tall structures and then just knocking them down. And my favorite feature is the radioactive breath which is cool, much like a dragon with it's breath of fire.The human characters are solid they serve their functions, however the one that stands out is Professor Tomoe whom is a sympathetic and tragic human protagonist, whom has a weapon that can possibility destroy Godzilla but it could also do great damage to mankind whoever hands possess it. It pretty much the damned if you do, damned if you don't dilemma, either way your kinda fraked.But what I also love the most is the music, the theme song is one of my favorite theme songs of all time, it fits with the character as it has an epic and menacing tone. And the cinematography is excellent, it has a documentary style to it which really adds to the darkness of this film because it gives it almost a sense of reality. One of the series of shots that stands out was seeing the aftermath of the destruction. Unlike most super sized foe films or even comic book films, those series of shots shows how the dire consequences of that destruction. As we see the amount of casualties there are, some people even a little girl has severe burns, I'll admit seeing those images was a bit shocking and sad. It really makes you concerned about the lives of everyone in Tokyo real made you feel what's happening matters and also made you question may'be even a little ashamed at some of the joy you took from the demolition scenes, hence the reality of destruction it's never without consequences.However what makes this Gozilla to me stand apart from the rest is just the fact that this wasn't really meant to be just a fun and games monster fest like the rest in the series were but it actually had some substance and heart.The film was also meant to be a metaphor on the fear of our sick and addictive need for weponization and progress and paying the price for it in the aftermath. Or how something we don't entirely understand or control in science will eventually destroy us. But also our conflicting dynamic between savagery and civility, from the weapons that we currently create and the gratification we sometimes get from destruction shows despite how many rules and advancements we've made in time, deep down we still might be bloodthirsty savages.Godzilla has made a big impression on Tokyo and our hearts.Rating: 4 stars",positive
"So this is where it all started!Of course, as Godzilla is my all-time favorite character, I admit to being raised on the heavily edited US version starring Raymond Burr. But when viewing this film in its original form, it not only looks more like a Golden Age Toho fantasy as we all know it, but it's a very powerful masterpiece, as it stands in the history of world cinema. Here in 2004, 50 years ago today after its release, American audiences finally get to see the film in its entirety, thanks to its long-awaited subtitled theatrical release by Rialto Pictures.Technically, Japanese monster movies began with the now-lost 1934 period fantasy, KING KONG HAS ARRIVED IN EDO (EDO NI ARAWARETA KINGU KONGU), which was obviously produced upon the success of the 1933 American classic, KING KONG. But it was GODZILLA (or GOJIRA as the Japanese call him) that truly made it over. Clearly inspired by the success of the 1953 hit, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (released to Japan by Daiei early the same year), with a bit of KONG thrown in, Toho set out to make their own monster movie, not knowing that they would create a phenomenon that would last to this day!What more can I say? This movie pretty much set the standard for Japanese monster movies as we all know! Watching the Japanese version is an amazing experience, and a hauntingly epic one!The special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, as low-tech as they were, had minor flaws (notably visible wires and missiles shooting against a background), but even for a first try in the monster genre, they still looked spectacular, as is the photography! Even though the effects work improved in future films, this is still the landmark of things to come.The music by Akira Ifukube is memorable. From his stirring main title music, to Godzilla's destructive, ponderous theme music, to the poignant ending. Again, Ifukube's work for this film sets the standard for his work in the fantasy film genre.The main cast is top-notch, as you'd expect. Akira Takarada (20 at the time) stars as salvage officer Hideto Ogata, the main character. Veteran actor Takashi Shimura plays Dr. Kyouhei Yamane, the eccentric paleontologist, who serves as the Godzilla-expert. Momoko Kouchi plays Yamane's daughter Emiko, who's in love with Ogata. But the best character by far (and my all-time favorite human character in a Godzilla film) is the tormented, eyepatch-clad scientist Dr. Daisuke Serizawa, played by Akihiko Hirata. When watching the Japanese version, other supporting characters share the spotlight, especially the newspaper reporter Hagiwara (Sachio Sakai), radiologist Tanabe (Fuyuki Murakami), the Ooto Island fisherman Masaji (Ren Yamamoto) and his younger brother Shinkichi (Toyoaki Suzuki). They just come off as mere background characters in the US version, but if you watch the Japanese original, you'll be totally surprised. Their performances were really dazzling, just like you'd expect from actors in a Toho fantasy film. Some of these actors would appear in future Godzilla films, as well as other SPFX fantasies from Toho.Compared to other incarnations, this film (as well as GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN) had the creepiest Godzilla ever, and that was just the way he was supposed to be! Almost like a black silhouette with bright, white staring eyes. Godzilla was not just a mere animal, he was basically a modern god! A raging, destructive demon with the power of the hydrogen bomb that affected him. Although Godzilla is inspired by the Rhedosaurus from BEAST, he was a completely different entity. He was virtually indestructible, and had an awesome power - a white-hot atomic breath! Godzilla became the archetype for many Japanese giant monsters to follow.But exactly what is Godzilla? As explained in this film (it's explained better in the Japanese version), he's a huge amphibious bipedal dinosaur that lives in caverns under the sea, feeding off of smaller sea animals. He was feared as a ""god"" on Ooto Island, and many young virgin women were sacrificed to him to appease his hunger. Hydrogen bomb tests affected his habitat, giving him unbelievable radioactive power & strength (and a towering size of 50 meters, 164 feet). And a sleeping giant was awakened . . .Makes you think more about those nuclear tests, doesn't it?Lastly, while the Japanese original played out more smoothly, the American version starring Raymond Burr (of PERRY MASON fame) as the visiting American reporter Steve Martin (not to be confused with the famous comedian!) is still very effective. The epic scale of the original still manages to shine through what the US producers could allow, and Burr (who was hired for a whole day for filming the added scenes) still did a serviceable job. American fans of the original version can at least be thankful for this US version, without which America could not accept Godzilla.As for the movie's story, I'd rather not go into it in detail. If you haven't seen it, please do so! Be it the original Japanese version (which I recommend the most, especially subtitled), or the edited US version!Here's to 50 years of a classic movie, and a classic character I will love forever!",positive
"Director of special effects for this movie Eiji Tsuburaya, (he was the first of his kind in Japan) once commented in an interview that ever since he saw King Kong, he wanted to make a movie just like it. He got his chance in this movie made 20 years later. Tsuburaya commented on the hardship he encountered when he tried to make the first Godzilla suit when right kinds of foam and rubber materials were not yet abundantly available in Japan at the time. He mentioned that he even used concrete to make part of the suit. Eiji Tsuburaya is also the inventor of the blue screen technique which later evolved into today's green screen technique. Modern movie owes Tsuburaya a lot for his pioneering works. Many people mistakenly credit Inoshiro Honda for the fantastic action scenes in this movie but it was Tsuburaya who did the work. Tsuburaya later went on to invent other characters such as ""Rodan"" and the original ""Ultraman"" series which is still popular today.I was raised on the American version of this movie starring Raymond Burr and didn't even know that another ""original"" version of this movie existed until recently (thanks to IMDb). I ordered the video from Japan and got to see it for the first time as it was created. After seeing this movie, I can now tell the discontinuity in the American version of Godzilla where Dr. Yamane mentions about Godzilla (in Japanese) before it shows up.This was the first Godzilla movie and it still holds up after 50 years, and what's even more remarkable is the fact that it's still the most realistic rendition of the monster. The production value have never been matched in this genre until the release of ""Gamera 1999, Revenge of Iris"" in my opinion.I give it a ""9"" because acting of Momoko Kochi and other actors are bit spotty, but Kochi made good later by studying hard to become a good stage actress in Shakespearian play, and became one of the best actress in Japan. Kochi also appears in her final role before her death in 1995's ""Godzilla vs Destroiya"" reprising her role as Emiko Yamane.",positive
"""Gojira"" is the original Godzilla film although viewers outside Japan may remember ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"", which was dubbed in English and included tacked in scenes featuring Raymond Burr supposedly to make the film more palatable to Western audiences. The story is simple: an immense, unstoppable monster rises from the abyss, destroys cities while shrugging off mankind's puny weapons, only to be ultimately stopped by a revolutionary new weapon. Filmed less than 10 years after the end of the Second World War, there is much speculation that 'Gojira', born in radioactive fire, is a metaphor for American militarism. There are numerous references to the war and, in the film, much of Tokyo is destroyed by fire, as was the case in 1944/45. There is no point in discussing the history of the film as there are books on the Godzilla phenomenon, several excellent featurettes accompanying some of the DVD releases, a detailed trivia section on IMDb, and numerous informative web-sites devoted to the character and his/her/its film legacy. Suffice to say, ""Gojira"" is a great film and well worth watching, whether as stand-alone entertainment, as the initial entry into a long and constantly changing series of films, or as a key chapter in the history of Japanese cinema. IMO, best watched in Japanese (with subtitles if necessary).",positive
"Damn perfect monster chaos. It's easy to look at all the Godzilla references in popular culture and forget the social relevance of the original. It's a wonderfully constructed film, that makes the existence of this monster important. If any country knows the horror of nuclear weapons it's Japan. Here they express concerns over continuing tests, without wallowing in self pity or reverting to anti-American propaganda. This film genuinely looks at the humans as a single race, and how Godzilla's existence will impact the world. Godzilla is kept off screen for quite some time, allowing for the mystery and suspense to build. It also introduces us to a range of interesting characters and relationships, giving us that human connection essential to a monster movie. Reporters, politicians, scientists are all represented, but not in the usual clichéd ways. Hirata plays the most interesting character, a man whom develops a weapon to destroy Godzilla, which is just as destructive as the one that created him. His morals in using such a weapon are well played out and add to a beautiful finale. The final scenes are scored with such serene bittersweet sounds, it really emphasizes the emotional battle going on. Sound effects are lowered at this point, as Godzilla and his human enemies come into conflict, without resorting to a battle. It's a sad moment that begs the question ""Why must all movies be loud an obnoxious these days?"". The model work is brilliant, as is Godzilla in his suit. People would seem to prefer a CGI creation to a man in a suit these days, but this suit looks real, the threat is really destroying these buildings. It may look ridiculous sometimes, but in black and white it's hard to tell. You can criticize the science all you want, but it's much more important to this viewer to make sure you have interesting and engaging events, plus characters.",positive
"This is it; the original Japanese version of ""Gojira"" (aka ""Godzilla""), the film that introduced the now-legendary movie monster. But does the movie have anything to offer besides a man in a rubber suit stomping all over a miniature version of Tokyo? I think so.It isn't too surprising that the film is actually a thinly-veiled allegory for the threat of the escalating weapons race circa 1954. After all, other sci-fi films of the era covered similar ground. However, what I find interesting about this film is how it gives equal consideration to both sides of the argument.The script does a good job of building suspense around the creature until we get to his inevitable rampage. From that point on I find that the action flags a little but that may be due in part to the sometimes unconvincing special effects. Then again, what do you expect from a 54 year old monster movie from Japan? The miniatures often look like miniatures and Godzilla is, after all, a guy in a rubber suit. Nevertheless, while the effects aren't even as convincing as 1933's ""King Kong"" I think that they still hold a certain charm.The cast isn't bad and it does include Takashi Shimura of ""Seven Samurai"" fame. The acting didn't grab my attention much but, then again, I couldn't exactly catch every nuance while paying attention to the subtitles at the same time. Ishirô Honda's direction is solid and the Akira Ifukube score provides pretty good support to the action. I thought that the sound was a bit sub-par at times, though.Ultimately, ""Gojira"" is worth watching despite its rudimentary special effects. In my mind, it's the underlying symbolism that makes the film special. By the way, forget about the American-ized version, ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters""; it's a sometimes clumsy reworking that ignores most of the original film's complexity.",positive
"Yes it is, unlike the Jurassic Park rip that Emmerich and Devlin tried to pull off, this is a true kaiju film, the real Godzilla that we all know, that went after people, trampled houses, tore down buildings, roared so loud, and showed no fear, it was unstoppable, gigantic, and most important of all, it had fire breath weapon! Just like a giant cross between a dinosaur and dragon, it caused rampage all over Tokyo, it is born from the bombs of US, supposedly to go against the COld War, and nuclear weapons in general, it is not anti-US if that's what you're thinking, and sure it was black and white, Japanese, and the effects aren't as good as today's standards. But still, you cannot deny the terror and the film that is Godzilla! Still good after 50 years, this was the film that had the kaiju eiga started, perhaps the most recognizable and best of all of them. Watch this, this is great, even though it looks old. Give it a chance.",positive
"Gojira (not Godzilla, King of the Monsters, with Raymond Burr), stands as one of the best monster movies...and one of Japan's finest and most allegory pieces of cinema. The original version of the movie has a lot of anti-nuclear sentiment that the US editors dropped from the Raymond Burr version. A woman on a subway noting that is seemed like she survived Nagaski only to die from Godzilla is an offhand but telling comment on Japan's unique view of the use of nuclear weapons.The story itself is makes a bit more sense than the patchwork used with Raymond Burr (though that version is also quite good for the genre that it helps perpetuate). The effects are (I think) still great...the grainy, documentary feel of the movie makes it seem a lot more real.",positive
"America had to wait fifty years to see the original version of Gojira in all its terrifying glory. This is not a user-friendly, action romp giant-monster film. This is the story of an unstoppable, destructive force unleashed on a city, its aftermath, and the impossibly hard choices people must make in response. Of course, nearly every U.S. giant-monster fan has seen the recut-for-Americans version of this classic, with Raymond Burr sharing scenes with the backs of various anonymous heads standing in for members of the Japanese cast. And while we all feel affection for that version, the truth is, compared to the original, ""our"" version loses much of its impact, and stands revealed as an act of vandalism which sadly underestimates the tolerance of the American audience.Truly a cut above every other kaiju ever made, this is the one to see. Trust me, you won't miss Raymond Burr a bit.",positive
"Thanks to Classic Media, this film is finally available in its original Japanese version. ""Gojira"" has been my all-time favorite since buying the excellent 2-disc edition and is not only a good monster movie, but a true nuclear allegory that should be recoginized for its realism. It's completely different from the American version in so many, better, ways. The love triangle is a vey nice touch and you can feel each character's emotional pain as the drama excels til the moving climax. ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (Raymond Burr version) was a light-hearted typical 50s sci-fi feature, which didn't leave much of a message once the credits rolled. ""Gojira"" is much more powerful and somber. The pain of the victims is expressed in more detail, a strong reference to the carnage left by the A-bomb in 1945. This was largely thanks to Honda who witnessed the devastation firsthand as a soldier in WWII. This movie clearly illustrates the protest against nuclear weapons. Godzilla embodies this idealogoly perfectly as a maniacal and fearsome creature born from man's ignorance with no sympathy or mercy. This is also the film where Godzilla is very menacing to the human characters. Eiji Tsubaraya's SFX and Ifukube's powerful score combine to make his rampage a tragic, symbolic, yet enjoyable sequence. Honda directs the cast in a way that sets a dark mood for the audience. Radiation is not pushed aside as it is later on in the series, but shown as the deadly poision it is. Even children are not spared, as they weren't at Hiroshima or Nagasaki grimly. Besides a select few other G-films, this is the only one that visualizes the human suffering after an attack so vividly and realistically. ""Gojira"" is no doubt Toho's greatest film and one of Honda's greatest masterpieces. With this film, the ultimate franchise was born, with three series, 28 films, and lasted 50 years. And hopefully with films to come. I think a remake of this film with modern SFX, and the same emotional power, would be great. Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin tried to make their own remake in 1998, but we all know how SHITTY that came out...",positive
"GOJIRA (GODZILLA) is so different, sans the inserted Raymond Burr action / narration sequences. Telling its own story, minus an American perspective is refreshing, especially after having seen only the Burr version for so many years. It is far more clear that the titular mega-monster is a metaphor for nuclear holocaust and its aftermath.World War II was still very fresh in the Japanese mind, and Director Ishiro Honda took that darkness in the collective psyche, and unleashed it on the screen! It's also great to watch a serious film about the atomic lizard, before his entering into the realm of films geared almost exclusively toward children. Though, as a kid, I loved all of the GODZILLA movies, they were mostly fluff, and took on no deep issues. In this way, GOJIRA stands alone as a true classic of the ""giant monster"" sub-genre...",negative
"I sat down and viewed Gojira for the first time today and was very impressed with it. I must say that I haven't seen a ton of monster movies but this is my favorite so far and it sounds like a lot of people feel the same way. This movie deserves all the fame recognition it has gotten.The effects absolutely blew me away, the cities burning, the seascapes, the monster itself and just about everything else were spot on. The performances are great, as well as the story and characters. I can't tell you how awesome this movie is in words, you'll just have to find that out for yourself.CHeck this one out if you like The Host, Cloverfield, King Kong and any other monster movie. You'll enjoy it.",positive
"Dark, gripping and meaningful, this is the finest Goji film ever made. The story is classic, Goji is absolutely terrifying as a representation of the atom bomb and its effects. The music is legendary, the human characters are the best in the series and the effects are very impressive for the time.
An absolute classic of cinema!Highest possible recommendation!",positive
"First we had King Kong (1933), one of the most important and first large monster films, than we had giant insects... the point in which you thought that all large monster films are gonna die... but, no worries, Japanese are always there to save the day. Godzilla (1954), is bigger, badder, better, meaner, faster, and more artistic than any other monster films. It's the movie that sets some new standards.The film was based upon the story of Shigeru Kayama ""Gojira"" from the words ""gorilla"" and ""kujira"" (whale). It's without any doubt one of the most significant SF films in Japanese cinema, and we have a proved fact that this movie has a large number of sequels, a US remake, an animated series and we are expecting something new. This movie of Inoshiro Honda is based upon foundation of already tried stories: A large monster suddenly comes alive, and it's growing in catastrophe for human civilization. You can easily say that the story motives are the same just like in the Frankenstein (1932), for example... But Japanese view of these thing is different. Godzilla is not appearing for some purpose, he is there only for the plot, he is an unstoppable, blind force ready for destruction, and there's also a human's error of his interfere in nature, so by the looks of things, the large monster is some kind of ""payback"" from mother nature.The movie has good acting crew, excellent direction, an inspiring and brilliant music score by Akira Ifukube, who also made Godzilla roars, the special effects were also great, done by Eiiji Tsuburaya. And from this moment, this movie is a great inspiration to many more monster films... we are expecting more today.",positive
"Perhaps nobody knows the stakes of nuclear folly better than the Japanese. I mean, after all, the United States dropped atomic bombs on both Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, thus bringing a swift end to World War II. Somewhere afterward, ambitious Japanese filmmakers at Toho, headed by director Ishiro Honda, thought that the war hadn't ended yet, at least in a superstitious sense. This film had many personal touches to it. You see, atomic bomb tests in the Pacific Ocean after the end of the war awaken a 100-meter tall beast that later threatens to lay waste to civilization, civilization being Japan and its neighboring islands. I grew up watching the Big Green Guy get into all sorts of big monster brawls over the years. I've watched him grow into into the greatest movie monster I've ever seen. But those who know the lore know it well: this beast, Gojira (Godzilla in the United States), attacked Japan with a wicked, nuclear vengeance that could only be compared to the magnitude of somebody dropping a bomb once again on this tiny island. Godzilla would star in many films over the next 50 or so years, the message becoming less and less apparent in favor of a more simplistic, action-oriented approach. This first ""Godzilla"" film is relentlessly somber in its message, with the opening scenes easily bringing back memories of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Also, those familiar with ""Gojira's"" (""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" in the U.S.) know the complicated history in bringing this film stateside. Many of the anti-nuclear war themes were shed for fear of Americans becoming polarized over its message, and subtle anti-American vibes that could change the course of the Cold War, which was in its beginnings in 1954. American actor Raymond Burr was carefully inserted into the American version, while many scenes from the original Japanese film were re-edited, re-arranged, or deleted altogether; also, many new scenes were filmed to give the impression that Burr is interacting with the original Japanese cast. The end result is a controversial treatment that does away with many of the core themes of Honda's original vision. In the rocky times since its release, it seems that instead of ""Gojira"" keeping us away from nuclear trouble, we've been turned onto it in what seems to be a second arms race. To this day, ""Gojira"" or ""Godzilla"" remains the supreme movie monster epic, at least in this fan's eyes.10/10",positive
"Toho Company Ltd.'s series of Godzilla films is the longest running film series in the history of film-making, with twenty-eight films and one American remake spanning over the time of five decades. Overtime, many audiences began to refer to the Japanese Godzilla films as campy, low-budget sci-fi flicks that will only appeal to a certain range of fans and viewers who like to watch men in rubber suits bumping against each other in the middle of a cardboard city.But any Godzilla fan, and a few fortunate others who don't think much of the Japanese monster films, would know that Godzilla began as something much more than just a low-budget science-fiction flick. The very first film, titled ""Godzilla"" was, and still is, a dark allegorical anti-war epic symbolizing the horrors and tragedies that could fall upon our world if we continue to recklessly unleash our carelessness upon it. So while Godzilla is undeniably a monster movie, it delivers a message to the world and it hasn't lost its power.Like any other monster movie, Godzilla has a few commonly-seen things in it. There is a monster, of course, that causes destruction upon civilization. There is an opening catastrophe that causes panic and confusion. There is a scientist who wants to preserve the monster for scientific research, and those who simply want to kill it, and it turns out that the monster is hard to defeat. That has all been seen, and is still seen in monster movies to this day. But those films don't graphically re-enact the suffering of a nuclear attack. ""Godzilla"" was produced just nine years after World War II. Director Ishiro Honda had seen how the victims of Hiroshima suffered after the nuclear bomb was dropped upon their city. Honda used his experience to show innocents both dead and dying after the monster's destructive rampage and the emotional impact is no less than devastating.As for the special effects, Godzilla is widely known to feature men dressed up in rubber suits with wires controlling their tails. This was also used in the first Godzilla film, but to a much more realistic degree. While the staff had wanted to use the same stop-motion effects used in movies such as ""King Kong"", they could not find the money or time (it would have taken seven years to make Godzilla through stop-motion animation) to do it. The man in a rubber suit was the only alternative and it did look convincing enough for its age. Nowdays, its primitive, but back then, audiences could accept it. And as for the wire clinging to Godzilla's tail, it can only be seen in one shot. And Godzilla does not attack a city made out of crude cardboard in this film. He strikes a realistically reconstructed miniature version of Tokyo and causes realistic damage. Electric wires spark when he strikes them, power plants literally blow up, and buildings crumble in large chunks (like they would in real life).Acting was first-class, especially when compared to the acting that would be achieved in later Godzilla films. The famous Japanese actor Takashi Shimura pulled off an amazing role as Professor Kyohei Yamane, the scientist who wanted to study Godzilla. And not just because it was a monster, but because it was a creature who could survive an atomic bomb. Throughout the film, the character of Professor Yamane tries to convince others that Godzilla could be studied for the benefit of humankind. This character, and the others, are not action heroes like what we see in American movies like ""King Kong"". The heroes are made heroic by their moral decisions.When ""Godzilla"" was distributed into the United States two years later, some catastrophic changes with made to the film. It literally lost all of its allegorical power and symbolism that existed in its original version. References made to the nuclear bombs, character development, and many other aspects were either lowered tremendous or entirely eliminated and replaced with narrations and inserted shots of Raymond Burr. And while Burr pulled off a good performance, he could not compare to the great character development from the Japanese version.But now that the original, uncut and undubbed version of ""Godzilla"" can be purchased in the United States, after fifty years American audiences can finally understand how the series began. Only by the tremendous success of ""Godzilla"" would so many sequels come into existence. Overtime, the series lost its power and Godzilla changed from a allegorical horror film to a low-budget campy series.But the original film will not be forgotten, because it stands out among all of the other monster movies as a science fiction film with a purpose.",positive
"This movie is a masterpiece. I have always been a big fan of the Godzilla series when I was a child but when I discovered the original movie when I was maybe twelve years old or something, it was the first movie that truly impressed me. I already had a sense for good cinema at a time when all my friends knew about Japan was Pokemon and preferred to watch Hollywood movies. The movie has nothing lost of its intensity since then and I recently watched this film again.Everything about this movie is perfect. First of all the atmosphere. The beginning of the movie is worthy of an excellent horror flick. You see destruction, fear and pain and you are on the edges of your seats because you don't really know what's going on. When Godzilla then first appears on the back of a Japanese island you have shivers running down your spine. The ugly look of this giant is truly scary and not comparable with the sympathetic look of the same monster in the upcoming features or the mediocre American movie.Another big point is the strong acting. The strange and lonesome Doctor Serizawa that turns out to be a warm-hearted hero is simply amazing and the acting of Akihiko Hirata really touched me and almost made me cry in the end. The curious, old and stubborn Kyohe Yamane played by Takashi Shimura and his beautiful and charming daughter Emiko portrayed by Momoko Kôchi are also excellent. Add the dynamic and young Hideto Ogata that is played by Akira Takarada to this and you have four excellent characters and actors that interact very well. The emotions that connect them all go way further than just love and respect, it's about honour, knowledge, politics, responsibility, science and trust. In one hour and a half, the characters of this movie are more authentic, diversified and intense than any characters of any Hollywood movie of three or four hours at the same time. These Japanese were simply miles ahead and even today, this movie portrays Japanese culture in an extraordinary way.Let's add to this that the special effects and the camera works of the movie are highly detailed and artistic for the time the movie was created in. When Godzilla grabs the trains in the Tokyo bay, slowly disintegrates the clock tower and smashes the power lines that have all been constructed in a long work as miniature objects while a man walking around in a huge latex costume all destroys them in a few minutes, these moments have something epic, powerful and unforgettable that modern special effects can't reproduce. This is the magic of the early after war cinema. Don't forget the memorable soundtrack of the movie filled with dark and menacing but also majestic melodies that you won't forget and that have been used over and over again during the upcoming decades. The scream of the monster is also extremely haunting.The movie is somewhat divided into four parts and very well-balanced. It starts as an intense catastrophe and horror movie, than touches some serious parts dealing with sciences and politics, than turns into a stunning symphony of destruction to end on a highly human and philosophical note. This masterpiece is like four excellent movies in one and never gets boring. I could simply watch this every month. If you haven't seen it yet, go and change it now. This movie definitely is in my top twenty-five movies of all times.",positive
"""Godzilla"" is a classic monster movie by Toho. The movie kept me going and never did I got bored with it. The story is incredibly well told and it is definitely a great start for the Godzilla series just before it got campier, and then going back to its roots. I never saw that many Godzilla movies, but I wouldn't mind checking them out myself. The cast did great for what they were told to do, and really works better in Japanese than watching the English dubbed version with Raymond Burr. The costume of the monster is what it was, and never I find it laughable; it did work by suspense whenever Godzilla shows up, and destroying many buildings. The music works well in the movie, while some scenes that feature no music makes it more effective. The movie is in black and white, but I think it works than presenting it in color. I can't explain why it works, but I was fine the way it was filmed. If you enjoy monster movies like ""King Kong,"" ""Cloverfield,"" or any other monster movies, then this movie is for you. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",positive
"I'm speaking of the Japanese language (with English subtitles) version, not the Raymond Burr-added, slightly muddled, American version. Burr adds a lot to the film, being much more effective than the Japanese actor who delivers the same lines in this version. However, the heavy editing in the last half hour of the Burr version (resulting in a clumsy insertion of a flashback regarding the Japanese scientist and the ""oxygen destroyer""), marrs an otherwise entertaining version. While admittedly sluggish in the first 45 minutes, the Japanese version carefully builds the story with legends (""Gojira"" is a mythical creature of native superstition who is fed maidens to placate him), sitings (Godzilla is never seen, even in shadow, only the result of his destruction is graphically displayed), and characters who represent human concerns of species extinction, nuclear contamination and conscience over weapons development. The ""oxygen destroyer"" is much more clearly explained in this version, and seems almost plausible. However, this movie really takes off, from the time of the first real siting of Gojira to the epic destruction of Tokyo, as technically proficient an undertaking as the New York scenes in the original ""King Kong"". Seeing this magnificent version of ""Godzilla,"" I can easily understand why the only two other movie monsters who have made more screen appearances are Frankenstein and Dracula.I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy on Ebay, but I caution potential buyers to make sure their copies state ""English subtitles"". In this version, I give ""Gojira"" a ""9"". The Raymond Burr version is good for a ""7"".",positive
"American nuclear weapons testing has resulted in the creation of an almost invincible, prehistoric-looking beast that makes T-Rex seem like a cute little kitten by comparison.Ishiro Honda's Godzilla has cemented itself well and truly in film history. It is generally considered to be an allegory for the destruction and devastation unleashed on Japan by the atomic bomb, with the 400-foot-tall mutant dinosaur Gojira, serving as the visual metaphor.The compelling love triangle between Ogata, Emiko and Serizawa, together with a certain dramatic sacrifice adds to the film's emotional impact.Despite the low-tech special effects, the clever use of camera angles and city building miniatures, as well as Akira Ifukube's destructive, thumping and pounding theme music, combine to create the impression that Godzilla is an impressive and implacable force of nature or destructive demon.The original Godzilla (1954) is an absolute must-see film.",positive
"Forget the sappy 1998 remake, for this stands as the true version of GODZILLA, the way it should always be told. Shorn of the surplus Raymond Burr footage added on for the American version entitled GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS!, this is a bleak, powerful and harrowing allegory concerning the use of nuclear weaponry, made only nine years after Hiroshima was destroyed by the atomic bomb.Unlike the later films in the series, made for children, which went for all-out comedy, this has none of that. Instead, the film has a distinctly sombre tone, helped no doubt by the stark black and white footage. While the story has been diluted by the countless other 'giant monster on the rampage' film that we've seen over the years, the messages that this film contains are still as fresh as ever. Godzilla himself, as I'm sure you already know, is just an allegory for the atomic bomb, or even America itself, and the horror of nuclear weapons is the focus point for the end of the film. It involves a professor, who has created a weapon called the 'Oxygen Destroyer' which destroys all life in water when it is immersed, from fish to plankton, everything. Everyone wants him to use this weapon to destroy Godzilla, but he can't live with the knowledge of having a weapon just as powerful as the atomic bomb in his grasp.The film is helped by some good acting from the Japanese cast, with the great and underrated Takashi Shimura giving another sympathetic and understated turn. Godzilla looks more realistic than he did when he was in colour, and the special effects won awards. The only problem I had was that all the destruction scenes took place at night, this made them hard to see. I suppose the reason for this was to hide the low budget. Still, there is a lot more to this film than simple destruction, and the film succeeds due to the strength of the story and the powerful way in which it is told. A classic, and more deservedly so than the American counterparts, due to the reasoning behind it.",positive
"Monster movies have never been as hard-hitting or culturally relevant as the original Japanese behemoth known simply as Gojira, and where it spawned a lifetime of sequels and spin offs growing more and more camp and silly as time went on, the 1954 original stands head and shoulders above them all. Godzilla is more than just a man in a rubber suit stomping over a miniature city, he is a walking manifestation of the fear surrounding the atomic bomb devastating a microcosm of the arrogance of Humanity. Ishiro Honda's masterpiece drove home the devastation of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in such a way that it has taken decades for its haunting imagery to become accepted by a world at large, while its message of the need to universally turn our backs on nuclear power as yet continues to fall on deaf ears.",positive
"For more than ten years I have been a fan of Godzilla and other Kaiju movies. I have seen all the Big-G's films but this one is truly the best. The film conveys the message of man tampering with the forces of nature and nature biting back, hard.The acting is Brilliant and the characters are given a good deal of ... well character and emotion.The soundtrack is another aspect that I think should be praised. The reason for this is that it adds to the tension of the film.Throughout the franchise's fifty year history the only other giant monster movies that come close to matching it, in my opinion, are GMK, Godzilla 1984 and Gamera 3.Oh and another thing. For me the fact that it is in black and white helps to create an even darker atmosphere.",positive
This film is a truly excellent monster movie about the horrors of nuclear war,positive
"This is definitely worth seeing, even if you don't like monster movies. Gojira is the original, original Godzilla movie; you can tell if it's the original because it's in black-and-white, in Japanese, with (if you're lucky)English subtitles.Having your city trashed by a monster is an unpleasant experience, and Gojira is suitably grim and dark; the black and white photography helps this. The best scenes are those among victims and survivors at the first-aid stations; instead of just screaming in panic (as in the average scare movie), the people combine this with some attempts to maintain a few shreds of human dignity...all highly realistic and convincing. Many of these scenes were left out of the English-dubbed version with Raymond Burr inserts, so you have to see the original.The monster-scenes are pretty stupid, but there aren't all that many of them anyway. There is also a love-triangle which is fairly convincing.Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Godzilla movie deserves a chance to see the one that started it all; I can make a copy available to anyone who needs one.PS I have translated the very moving Hymn to Peace which the schoolchildren sing near the end:Peace, oh peace, return, Oh light, return ...Oh, please come back again Let there be life and bread Oh, pray for our people now On this dark and dreadful day.----------------------------------------- We stand here desolate, Peace, oh peace, return Oh light, return Oh, please come back again. Aaaaah...",positive
"I recently got to see the original GOJIRA on the big screen in Hollywood last year. Having seen GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS many times over the years, I couldn't help but notice a stark contrast between the two.GOJIRA was shown in it's original form, complete and uncut. Instead of the annoying English dubbing often common in the other Godzilla films, English subtitles were used-to great advantage. The acting was superb,(of course, the English dubbing in the Americanized version just about destroyed the effect of the performances, even though Raymond Burr was excellent).
More importantly, the scenes of Godzilla attacking Odo Island, and eventually  downtown Tokyo were extremely well done, not to mention the aftermath of the devastation. To top it off, the powerful score by Akira Ifukube complements the atmosphere of death and destruction perfectly.Having seen every Godzilla movie ever made(with the exception of the latest one released last month in Japan), GOJIRA is no doubt the first and the best.Rating: ***** out of *****",positive
"I can't add much beyond what other people have said, other than to mention that while Gojira certainly is the best of the godzilla films, and probably the best Kaiju film, it is also worthwhile (and just) to consider it outside of those confines.  If you watch a lot of Japanese cinema from this period, you will find Gojira compares very favorably even with the incredible works of Kurosawa at this time.  While other monster films (including all the rest of the Godzilla films) are at best B films and at worst nothing but camp, Gojira can be watched at a classic, a wonderful allegorical tale with enough emotion, philosophy and stark terror for two movies.  The raw, grainy black and white images of the destruction of Tokyo are as effective as they must have been when they first aired in Japanese theatres.  Why this film has not been treated as a classic and never brought over in its original, unedited form remains a mystery to me.  This film is no less poignant than Fire on the Plain in dealing with the war related horrors that Japan was to undergo, and its as visually stunning as your going to get from this period.",positive
"In its original Japanese cut, Godzilla is arguably the best monster movie ever made. It combines a dark, somber atmosphere with excellent special effects and a compelling story. It takes the giant monster paradigm established by King Kong and raises it to a whole new level, adding great actors and political relevance.The film succeeds by taking itself extremely seriously. Rather than aiming for a children's matinée audience, it is explicitly adult, stressing the human suffering and death caused by the monster's rampage. In scenes cut from the American version, children are shown mourning dead parents or dying from radiation poisoning. The tone is further darkened by the explicit connections to nuclear warfare and real life tragedies such as the Lucky Dragon incident.The film further benefits from excellent film-making at all levels. The cinematography in the scenes where Godzilla rampages through Tokyo is majestic, with the cinematographer drawing on his experiences of wartime Japan to envision a city on fire. The film also boasts a superb cast led by Takeshi Shimura.Many people will be reluctant to check out this movie due to its increasingly juvenile sequels. However, this is a true classic of world cinema that deserves more attention.",positive
"The original 1954 Japanese giant monster extravaganza continues to carry a lot of weight, as both an incredibly entertaining spectacle of destruction and a potent examination of the after effects of WWII - specifically, the idea of the atomic age. Godzilla himself is symbolic of everything horrifying and destructive about the H-bomb, and the toll that it can take on human lives. Masterfully directed by Ishiro Honda (who also co-wrote the screenplay), it's genuinely exciting in its action scenes, with special effects that are pulled off in a respectable way. Honda does begin the film with a jolt, but then takes his time building the story until the inevitable major rampage around the one hour mark. ""Godzilla"" is never more entertaining than when Big G is stomping around, but it's also very serious and sobering as well, and the aftermath of the one big set piece is very emotional.It also helps that the human stories are worth watching; the main thread is a love triangle between heroic scientist Ogata (Akira Takarada), the girl he loves, Emiko (Momoko Kochi), and another eminent scientist, Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata). When the enormous lizard of the title emerges from the ocean and annihilates everything in his wake, Emikos' father, Yamane (Takashi Shimura) is called upon to provide expert advice. What Yamane would like to do more than anything is study Godzilla, while Serizawa contrives what could be a possible means of dealing with the problem.Godzilla is truly a force of nature here; he's at his scariest and most bad ass, emitting radioactive mist from his mouth that is capable of setting people and objects on fire. His first reveal in the film is more amusing than anything else, but soon we find out what kind of horrors that he's capable of. The black & white photography gives the appropriately atmospheric touch to this tale, and the music by Akira Ifukube is simply excellent; it's no wonder that it would consistently be reused for subsequent Toho productions. The performances are engaging from the principals, with Sachio Sakai also scoring as investigative reporter Hagiwara. A brave act of self sacrifice at the end gives the proceedings a great deal of impact.Overall, it's easy to see how this character and franchise has become so iconic and influential for the past 60 years.Nine out of 10.",positive
"For those who are mildly interested in this movie, you must understand the seriousness of this movie. More than a movie about a guy in a rubber suit breaking toy buildings, Gojira is a very serious consideration about the horrors of nuclear war.A few items to watch for include:The first scenes of Tokyo after having been leveled by Gojira (Godzilla) almost mirror the photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings.The images of the injured people in the hospitals again, mirror the photographs of ""survivors"" of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.Look for references to the American nuclear tests on the Bikini atolls (they are abundant).Finally, keep in mind that Gojira is a symbol of nuclear war. The reason that tanks, planes and heavy artillery don't stop it is because once a nuclear bomb is dropped, nothing can stop the devastation. The only way to avoid it is to not be there in the first place.Gojira (Godzilla, King of the Monsters) is a definite must-see for anyone interested in film-making at its best.",positive
"Whether I really have gone for some 50 odd years of cinema going and not seen this before is pretty hard to believe but then maybe I have only seen the US version and until this DVD release been deprived of the awesome picture that it is. True, I am more in a position now to appreciate the film in the context of the film being made shortly after the end of the war and the irony (or is it intentional?) that the devastated scenes of devastated Tokyo look just like the war torn devastation itself, just a few years earlier. The movie opens very dramatically and never lets up. Some people have pointed to shortcomings in budget or animation ability, but for me the scenes of Godzilla becoming entangled in the overhead wiring, tearing into the train and rampaging with the horizon ablaze are second to none. Great sound, good dialogue and visually stunning.",positive
"Just about everyone has seen Godzilla, King of The Monsters, but not too many people have seen Gojira with English subtitles.  I had heard that the all-Japanese version was much better than the one with the scenes with Raymond Burr, and only recently was able to make that judgment for myself.
The American version includes all the monster footage from Gojira, (though the sequence of the shots sometimes varies) except for a few extra shots of the jets attacking him just before he returns to the sea after his second and most lethal attack on Tokyo.  There is a little more discussion with Dr. Yamane explaining his findings with slides at the open forum and more discussion in Serizawa's lab with Emiko and Ogata, and aside from a few additional shots here and there, thats about it.  However, what separates the two films is being informed exactly what is being said in Japanese, whether it involves a scene that is in both versions or just in Gojira. For example, we learn in Gojira that people and livestock were killed on Oto Island when the monster came ashore during a storm at night.  In the American version, it's unclear whether anyone was killed at all.  The legend of Godzilla is played up more on Oto Island, and the belief in the need to sacrifice maidens to the creature.  
At the forum, we learn that according to Dr. Yamane, Gojira is 50 meters tall, which is a considerable discrepancy from the American version where the scientist is dubbed as saying the monster is over 400 feet tall.  Very importantly, we find out what that big argument is about when some women really get into it with some government officials.  It seems the politicians want to keep Gojira's existence a secret from the general public, while the women think everyone should know about this prehistoric menace.  We also learn Yamane anticipates before any battles are fought that it is unlikely that Gojira will be able to be killed by conventional weapons.  We also obtain much more information about 'why' Dr. Yamane feels Gojira should not be destroyed. 
Gojira (and Godzilla) is probably the most successful example I've seen of a man-in-a-suit monster.  Somehow, the two night attacks on Tokyo are extremely effective.  In fact, Gojira's slow, methodical and deliberate manner of annihilating everything in his path, including people, buildings and military weapons, comes across as wanton and sadistic.  The music is a slow, hopeless, melancholy dirge that accompanies Gojira during his almost casual incineration of the city.
Overall, I'd say Gojira has the edge over Godzilla, mainly because you have so much more information about what is being said in Japanese, which of course gives you far better character development.  Gojira is a dark, gloomy film that is very unsettling to the point that even the eventual defeat of the monster is somehow not particularly reassuring.",positive
"This was the first of many Godzilla films and still is a joy to watch. The music became memorable whenever the military fights the large fire-breathing lizard. This black and white film is so much more menacing than the colors efforts of the sixties which were played for fun at times. Japan is going to be destroyed unless a secret device activated underwater is used against Godzilla. Raymond Burr plays a reporter, Steve Martin and is very descriptive as Godzilla makes his way through the city until Martin's building is toppled over. A special film for any Godzilla fan.",positive
"After repeated viewings of the American dubbed version of Godzilla(or gojira)i had never seen the original Japanese version until now.i thought it was better then the one with the Raymond Burr inserts.its darker.Godzilla is a product of our stupidity with the atom bomb,we made him.big difference between big G and King Kong.Kong was a prehistoric ape,no radioactive giant.this film paved the way for many sequels,some great,some fair,some really bad.heres a fact;Raymond burr appeared in two Godzilla films,the americanized 1954 version,released here in 1956,and Godzilla 1984,which was basically a remake/sequel. the special effects in this are very good.way too early for computer graphics.Godzilla is an actor in a rubber suit,sorry if i ruined it for anyone.but watch this and compare it to the americanized version. there is a difference.Godzilla is here to stay,he's an icon,and a reminder,be nice to mother nature,she strikes back.big G!you rule dude, i would like to see a gammera verses Godzilla movie.toho take note. 10 out of 10.awesome movie.",positive
"This is a great monster movie. Sure its not a good as King Kong (The greatest Monster movie of all time), but it is still great. First lets talk about the effects. The reason we should star here is because this was the first Japanese monster movie to use the man in a rubber suit idea. This would later become a tradition in Japanese monster films, like Gamera, Ultraman, etc. The Godzilla suit, unfortunately, does not look to impressive. I always thought that something looked wrong with the legs. They look sort of...............baggy, okay I don't really know how to describe them. The face on the suit is okay though. It kinda looks like a Chinese Dragon when viewed from the top. So now lets movie on to the plot. This movie actually has 2 versions, The Japanese version and the American Version, with Raymond Burr. The Japanese version is the Superior version because of the anti-bomb message and one certain great line. Which is what I used for the summary. Now lets talk about the acting. It's actually pretty good for a monster movie. So in the end this is not my favorite film in the Godzilla series but it is one of my favorites of the series, so it is recommended.",positive
"I remember as a kid on Saturdays watching the old Godzilla movies on TV I have been a Godzilla fan for more than 30 years but I had never seen the original 1954 movie. (the original Japanese film, not the the badly edited Raymond Burr Americanized version.) I finally got to see the Japanese version today and watching it made me realize why I am a fan. The later versions of these films were cheesy and childish, not this one. Producer Tomiyuki Tanaka wanted to make a film that was very similar to the 1930's King Kong movie, but the studio did not have the time or the budget so they went with a man in a suit. This movie came out 9 years after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki so the event was still fresh in the minds of the people of Japan. The movie depicts Godzilla as an unstoppable force of nature that was mutated by H-Bomb tests in the Pacific. Unlike the later films this movie takes a very serious take on the dangers of nuclear weapons. Godzilla's destruction of Tokyo was brilliantly film using low angles and life like minatures. The special effects are by 1954 standards pretty good and you tend to forget there is a man in a suit when Godzilla terrifies Japan. There are scenes in the movie that look like they came from World War II and the after effects of the Atomic bombing, the scenes of death are very realistic as well as the damage. The acting is first rate as it doesn't come across as too hammy and it is believable. It is a terrific monster movie that gave birth to a character I liked as a little kid. The King of the Monsters!!",positive
"Having accepted the 1956 'Raymond Burr' Godzilla as the definitive version for many decades, I'm glad I finally came across the 1954 original. At first I didn't like having so much backstory, as well as the love triangle subplot. Now I feel the original is better than the 1956 version.There is a lot of time spent on the remote island that's Godzilla's lair, but it's well-paced and includes the ship-sinkngs as well as Godzilla's appearance on the island. It seems that he appears in Tokyo Bay in no time. Intervening scenes of public meetings and consultations with scientists make sense, and add tension.Despite the incredible premise of a prehistoric creature emerging from its underwater habitat due to nuclear testing, we can suspend disbelief because of the plot's inner consistency (with an exception I'll get into later) and the palpable human scale of the drama. The various meetings show people genuinely stressed and panicked--clearly there's no blueprint for dealing with this crisis.The love triangle fits into the main plot because Serizawa, Emiko, and Ogata are all central characters. Serizawa gives us another subplot as a mad scientist type obsessed with ""a new form of energy."" He's not evil, however, as he really wants to use the ""oxygen destroyer"" for humanitarian purposes. But he has a dilemma: if it's used to kill Godzilla; he's risking its subsequent use as a weapon. As Ogata convincingly says, in effect, if we can't kill Godzilla we won't be around anyway.Emiko stands for the moral center, literally between the two men, and as the embodiment of beauty and goodness. These attributes are given form bya short scene of girls singing in church. As we switch back to Surizawa, he agrees with Emiko and Ogato to help. He realizes that the collective good is more important than individual recognition; it's actually sad when he sacrifices himself.As a result of the carefully-written subplots, we're more involved with the main characters. We're not just watching a bunch of people yelling at each other while the monster snuffs them out. The destruction scenes are definitely good; especially watching the train engineers as they face doom, and the fireman caught up in the overturning fire engine.Of course the trucks, cars, trains, ships, and buildings are obviously toys/models when viewed from the outside, but the transition from inner to outer views is smoothly done. The modelling is done to a fairly high level.My quibble aren't with the special-effects. There's a bit of a logic problem with the islanders. If they have developed a mythology for Godzilla, then presumably he's been around for a while; but certainly not for more than a few years, as the H-Bomb didn't exist until 1949. Maybe an archetypal memory of Godzilla from prehistoric times...?There's pretty much every sci-fi motif here: a remote island, disappearing ships, radioactive and nuclear testing, an emerging monster, experts unsure of how to respond, a mad scientist, an invasion/destruction of a city, and a secret weapon (courtesy of our mad scientist).To cap it all off is Godzilla himself. As many others have noted, this is the scariest of all Godzillas. He isn't as 'tricked-out' as he is in some later versions, but is somehow more animal-like, and less animated. Great viewing experience, and a more complete story than in most movies of this genre. 8/10.",positive
"Atomic bomb tests awaken a gigantic and dangerous centuries old dinosaur that threatens to destroy Japan. Director Ishiro Honda does an expert job of crafting a strong and unsettling mood of mounting panic, despair, and utter hopelessness while maintaining a steady pace and a grimly serious tone throughout. Godzilla in its debut feature comes across as a very brutal, lethal, and above all frightening behemoth beast: Godzilla's initial appearance on a mountainside, its attack on a train, and subsequent destroying of Tokyo are genuinely terrifying to behold. Indeed, the severe damage and destruction wrought by Godzilla packs a positively chilling wallop that has never been fully recaptured in any other entry in the series. Moreover, this film further benefits from sympathetic characters that one has a true emotional investment in: Akira Takarada as gallant coast guard officer Hideto Ogata, Momoko Kochi as the sweet Emiko, Takashi Shimura as wise paleontologist Professor Kyohei Yamane, and, best of all, Akihiko Hirata as bitter and reclusive scientist Daisuke Serizawa, who makes for a fascinatingly troubled and reluctant savior of mankind. The smart script by Honda and Takeo Murata offers a pertinent and provocative subtext on the perils of radiation and nuclear weapons as well as a doomed central love triangle which gives this picture a considerable amount of poignancy. The old school practical effects for the most part hold up well. Akira Ifukube's robust, yet melancholy score hits the rousing spot. Masao Tamai's sharp black and white cinematography provides a pleasingly shadowy noirish look. Dark, bleak, and excellent.",positive
"If you don't know anything about Godzilla then you must have been living in cave in the middle of Australia, because it is a massive cultural figure to come from Japan. However, if you haven't seen the film, then I doubt that you what the film is about. Godzilla is a monster film set in Japan. It starts with a number of ships sinking near Odo island and fish stocks had collapsed. After a storm that kills a lot of people and livestock the Japanese government send a team of scientists to investigate. However, the locals believe the reason behind it was a monster of folklore, the Godzilla. Adding to mystery was the the rain from the storm seems radioactive and contaminates some of the island's wells. Once it was proved that the 150 foot monster exists then the Japanese government prepares itself, because he is heading for mainland Japan. The unstoppable beasts causes massive amount of damage and its up to the scientists and military of Japan to find a solution.The film has a number of meanings behind it. The most obvious one is about the nuclear testing in the middle of Pacific ocean that was going on at the time, and saying it awoke a sleeping giant. When one of the scientists makes a weapon to stop Godzilla it raises the debate about whether it was right to use it or would it open a can of worms and be put to evil uses. It has a strong anti-nuclear mission. Another meaning that some critics have seen is that the film is a metaphor for the destruction Japan suffered during the Second World War. Within the scientific community some also wondered if it is right to kill Godzilla or to study him. In the Japanese Parliament there was also a debate about censorship, whether its right to let the public know about the monster. There is a lot in this film. Another feature in this film is the love triangle between Eriko, the daughter of leading Japanese scientist, to a Navy frogman and another scientist who she had known since childhood. It adds a personal dimension to the film.There was some decent model work, but the monster himself is really just a man in a suit, but it was made in 1954, so you have to accept that there weren't many special effects tools at the time. It's still fun seeing Godzilla attacking Tokyo. The acting isn't great, but it's good enough. I personally watched it in Japanese, and I really dislike dubbing foreign films because it looses its impact. The stand out performance was the woman who played Eriko. The film had a typical 1950s melodrama about it.Godzilla has been a very important film. It has a number of sequels, a mediocre American remake, and has influence films such as the Host and Cloverfield.",positive
"this comment here is about the real 1954 godzilla , the one before it was patheticaly slaughtered in the US . the film is a true work of art made by genius moviemaker hinoshiro honda about the fear of the japanese people of the atomic weapon and its effects after hiroshima and nagazaki . the movie contains beautifull special effects ( especialy for that time ) and has a true message which still echoes today only a decade and a half after the catastrophy of tchernobyl . the true power of this movie is mainly due to the almost documentary-like description of the events ,the masterfull directing job of honda , the incredible acting and the beautifull but haunting music which rythms perfectly the destruction of tokyo . this is a true classic , a masterpiece and a cult movie but if you have to see it , try to find the original asian version with subtitles and WITHOUT raymond burr ( who is commenting the events the way he is reading a grocery list ). a 10 out of 10",positive
"I was first introduced to Godzilla in cartoon form in the 1980′s as a child, but it wasn't until 1998, with Roland Emmerich's blockbuster reboot that I had seen the infamous beast on the pearl screen. I had also seem bits and bobs of the many original sequels as a child and they had made absolutely no impact on me what so ever! But I became aware of the significance of this, the original, only recently and it was due to this discovery that I hunted down the best copy available.I ended up with the 2005 Region 1 release, which also includes the U.S. reworking from 1956, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters!. I could not have imagined that a the 1954 version of Godzilla, or more literally, Gojira, could have been so mature, so sombre, or so tempered with its sledgehammer philosophising. Produced just nine years after the devastating nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which effectively ended the Second World War, Gojira takes up the mantle on doing what Science Fiction does best, and created the cypher in the form of Godzilla, to represent the devastation left over from the nuking of these cities.Godzilla is a nuclear beast, affected by U.S. nuclear tests and is now toxically radioactive and upon landfall on Tokyo, rains down, literally, nuclear destruction up on the city, in a manner not dissimilar too that levied upon either of the cities, Hiroshima or Nagasaki. But its not just about that. It about the creation of the next WMD which would ultimately be used against Godzilla but poses and moral dilemma that Robert Oppenheimer himself would appreciate, as to whether such a creation should be allowed to be developed. It also looks quite seriously into establishing the potential evolution of a creature such as Godzilla and uses plausible palaeontological arguments to justify his existence.The pacing was good and though Godzilla strikes from almost the opening frame, there is a sense of an ongoing crisis rather than an impending apocalypse, with news outlets reporting throughout as plans, both military and civilian are sited.All in all, this is not just the birth of the massive and largely corny and cheap Godzilla series, it is a striking, intelligent, moving and incredibly well judged masterpiece of 50′s cinema. But I should have known. Most rubbish franchises began with an inspired first movie, something to break the mould and this does the job perfectly.But it isn't without its flaws. The special effects, though not all bad, are below par even for the time, but effective as for telling the story, some were very good with ALL being well conceived and ambitious. Some were very poor though, such as the model ships, which were unnecessarily below the standards and look like bath toys. But the cinematography was wonderful, with Honda shooting this in a classically manner. Tension was built brilliantly and the action rose to several crescendos and the excellent score by Akira Ifukube was not overused but brought to perfect effect when needed.The acting was first-rate as well, proving Japanese cinemas reputation. But this was my first real foray into Japanese cinema, and what a treat it was. Many would look at this and see a cheap old film and others will see a film that whist let down by some less that brilliant visual effects and the fact that a lot of people, certainly in the U.K. find subtitles difficult, as a masterpiece not only of Eastern cinema but of cinema full stop. Truly realising its narrative and spirit, its cause and message. This was about a county in mourning not only for the hundreds of thousands lost by Fat Man and Little Boy, but for the war full stop. The 1950′s were a time of great political fear and reconstruction after WW2, and this is a film which taps into the brewing Cold War and fear of annihilation from human behemoths which once released can never be returned.HIGHLY recommended but not for children as they will bore, miss the point, get put off by the subtitles, black and white and quite frankly its a mature and bleak film and not the 1998 remake. And thank God or Godzilla for that!",positive
"I will come right out and say there are movies in the Godzilla franchise that I prefer to this original one. That might be slightly sacrilegious to say, according to some fans, but I'd also like to make clear that I love this movie for starting a franchise that has given me so much joy lately. And after watching all the films that followed this one, I do truly have more appreciation for it.When I first watched it, it simply felt like an above average, well made for its time, interesting giant monster movie. Now, it feels like a truly monumental achievement, having birthed such a diverse and engaging series of films, while also working very well on its own merits, in isolation from everything that came afterwards.It's known universally as the most serious, least campy Godzilla film, and for good reason. There are no monster fights, little in the way of traditional action, it's shot in foreboding black and white, and generally aims to be more of a horror movie than anything else. There's also the much discussed social commentary regarding Godzilla being a metaphor for the destruction the atomic bombings on Japan in WW2 caused, which just makes the film even more dark and despairing. That's not to say it's a depressing slog to get through, because the effects used to bring Godzilla to life are still quite fun, and it's engaging as a basic story because of its simplicity: 'this monster is destroying our cities and killing us, so we need to destroy the monster.'It's not as memorable as some of the campier films in the franchise, and it doesn't satisfy me as much as some of the more action-heavy later entries, but every subsequent entry in the Godzilla franchise owes its existence to this one, and for that reason alone, it deserves its status as an iconic classic. I feel like many film buffs will watch this and then not follow through on watching any others, but I'd implore them to reconsider, as while none are quite as groundbreaking or thought-provoking as this one might've been, so many have so many other great things to offer for those open-minded and patient enough to stick with the franchise.I look forward to revisiting this one soon, now that I've worked my way through the entire franchise, and could see my respect (and numerical score) for it going up even more afterwards. An iconic franchise needs an iconic start to hit the ground running, and 1954's original Godzilla proved to do just that.Long live the (arguable) king of Godzilla movies.",positive
"To criticise the original Godzilla would just be plain silly in my view. Yes everything looks so fake and yes the buildings are models and yes it's a guy in a suit but you know, so what? These are the special effects for the time and just as I complain about the latest Hollywood blockbuster these days and how in some other films the special effects are terrible, Godzilla's may look a little rough now but the un-real elements in this film do not detract from its experience nor do they ever take centre stage above the narrative or the themes within. Godzilla is a focused film; a film that is structured around an idea that is bold and outgoing whilst simultaneously making a statement about the world at the time of production. Godzilla retains a certain charm and a certain quality that never makes it uninteresting and surely that means it can only be labelled as a success.We've all seen the American remake and all had our opinions on it. I may have liked it as a child as a fast moving, good looking epic but thinking back, it makes the mistakes toward the end that its Japanese original and inspiration does not and that is allowing the special effects to take control of your picture. By the time what's-his-name and who's-it are in that subway station fending off Godzilla's young in a blatant attempt to recreate the kitchen scene out of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, you've accepted the film has gone down a certain disappointing route. But here I feel the scenes involving the special effects are really just the result of good film-making prior to it all happening. There is the introduction of the monster; the keeping the monster away from the screen; the presenting of the monster but not as a destructive creature; the dialogue building the monster up off-screen and then the carnage that is what Godzilla is capable of now that he's reached that level of destruction.I feel that despite the film being considerably large for its time, the people that made it probably never envisaged it becoming as successful as it did. The film has spawned sequels, prequels, spin-offs and even a remake forty years after the initial production. Hollywood were perhaps familiar with the concept of this big-budget, special effects extravaganza involving a giant monster following 1933's King Kong and were perhaps more used to this genre by the time they'd seen Gojira. But if the rumour that people were running from the cinemas following King Kong are true then I wonder what Ishirô Honda and Shigeru Kayama exactly had in mind before this was released. I think the emphasis was always on delivering a film with an intriguing story and one with some sort of eerie message at its centre, much unlike today's extravaganzas and perhaps a lot less than 1933's King Kong although the message nearer the end could echo along the lines of: 'Just what exactly consists of entertainment these days?' But it's not Honda and Kayama's fault this is as big as it is today and it's not their fault I saw this on a DVD disc free with a newspaper, complete with huge build up from a preceding television advert, right here in the year 2008. Godzilla may be a film that is a guy in a suit tearing down models of dodgy looking buildings whilst breathing some sort of fire rendering him more ancient, mythical dragon than deep sea lizard but it works in its own way. The film is a folklore story from ancient times, re-surfacing (no pun intended) into modern times through, what the characters deem to be, the lack of attention and acknowledgement to times gone by. It could be true that the legend that is Gojira is angry at the lack of sacrifice or food or whatever it was and he has come to wreck and nasty revenge or it could be a statement on Japan's ever growing modernity that, by now we all know, is the best in the world when it comes to stereo systems, gadgets and gizmos. I don't think the producers were threatening people with a giant lizard that will come from the sea and destroy us but the ruined Tokyo shots are probably metaphors for the falling apart of society if Japan itself looses focus of who they actually are and buckles under the immense pressures of 20th Century modernising.Then there are the plot elements that declare Godzilla the result of nuclear testing. World War Two had ended a mere nine years ago, ironically in the Pacific with the dropping of Big and Little Boy, respectively. Look what the nuclear blasts have done to us; look at the moral decision we now face: we must rebuild and get going again, but at what cost? No, a lizard won't come from the deep and destroy everything again but if we fall behind then Japan will never once again be a great nation. These are the questions and ideas I think Gojira raises given its timeframe. Then there is the lack of international support offered when Godzilla goes nuts, another statement on Japan's global position and relationship with other world powers following the war? Perhaps. The real-life images of Tokyo decimated from bombing adds to the reality Japan faced and the use of the special effects is smart: it's always model attacking model, not model attacking 'real' like America usually do it today and sometimes in 1933's King Kong. One of the reasons I thought Jackson's was better is because his is CGI fighting CGI. Gojira may borrow from Hollywood's story-telling regarding the morale choice and the 2nd Revelation but the film remains an entertaining and fascinating one all the same.",positive
"No I won't call him devil. But do remember that when he first appeared, Godzilla (or Gojira, please let's not fight over the name, whatever suits you best) was an evil creature. But not because he meant to be. That always was a byproduct of the radiation and because he got disturbed. So there are hints of King Kong here, if you want to make them.When I watched many Godzilla (and other Kaiju movies this inspired) as a kid, I was more than smitten by it. Watching it now, I can see the miniatures, though I have to admit, maybe because of the incredible work over at Criterion, I did not detect all the matte shots. And the movie is filled with those. So yeah by todays technical standards this may seem tame and even laughable to certain degrees - especially when it comes to models. Tiny cars and all that.But you would not just be missing the point, but derive yourself of so much fun you can have with the movie that kicked it all off. Fantastic extras too on the collection released earlier this year. With many interviews that make the achievement of making this movie even more impressive.It was nice rewatching this and even the US recut is on the disc I own. It looks phenomenal (never mind the framing, that's how movies were shot back then, in case you didn't know) and just hearing that trademark Godzilla roar ... shivers! So while we may smile at certain points (and it's ok to do that), the technical achievements here, both in sound and picture and the love of what they were doing, is showing on screen.Yes this is political, yes this is warning about nuclear power and what mankind is able to do and should avoid tempering in nature. There are messages here, that still resonate. And we have this animal that does not destroy just to do that - it just removes obstacles from his way.There is nostalgia for sure in my rating, but that does not take anything away from what was made here. And as we learn here, it could have gone in a completely different way. I love Harryhausen and he has done a lot for movies and beyond that. But I am happy, they decided to go with the man in a suit instead of the Harryhausen method. The (movie) world today probably would be very different ...",positive
"The Story: Atomic bomb tests revive a massive dinosaur, which proceeds to tear Tokyo a new one. Everything is used to try to defeat the monster, to no avail. Meanwhile a scientist discovers a dangerous new form of energy, which he is reluctant to use in fear it will fall into the wrong hands.This black-&-white, low-budget effort must surely rank as one of the best monster films of the 1950s. Unlike it's sequels, which are extremely cheesy & are nothing more than light-hearted fun, ""Godzilla"" treats the destruction of Tokyo as a metaphor of the atomic bomb blasts of Hiroshima & Nagasaki by the Americans. Indeed, most of the pain caused by those events are clearly on display in the film. The early scenes, with the ship being set on fire, resemble bomb explosions, while Godzilla's romp through Tokyo has a ferocity that rivals most action films, with the monster crushing train carriages, melting power lines with his radioactive breath & destroying buildings. There are poignant scenes, with the mother comforting her children, saying that they will join their father in death as Godzilla crushes their house & the reporters telling their viewers goodbye when the monster causes their tower to collapse.",positive
"Godzilla is a classic. It's undeniable. People always turn their noses up at it, probably because they associate Godzilla with some of his later films which upped the cheese factor. But this is a dark, dramatic, emotional and enthralling story about the threat of Nuclear weapons. I mean, this film comes from Japan, the only country to ever experience the trauma of a nuclear attack, an that is conveyed very well in the film. For example, the aftermath of Godzilla's rampage when people lay dead and dying in a hospital, or the haunting scene where the hall of girls sings a prayer of hope. The characters are very well drawn out and each fits in perfectly to their roles, all of which are played brilliantly by the actors. One of the best performances, or at least in my opinion, is the character Dr. Serizawa, a man who hides so much and is tortured by his secrets. Godzilla truly is an underrated film, with critics complaining about it because of its shoddy effects work and low budget. It's too bad, because they don't know what they're missing out on.",positive
"Just for the record, I was never one of the naysayers who found fault with the Matthew Broderick version of GODZILLA: I thought then and still think today that it's one of the finest depictions of a man-eating monster of all time- right up there with the John Carpenter/Rob Bottin version of THE THING and the original JAWS. While I'd always liked the Americanized version of GOJIRA, it wasn't until I saw the original that I realized just how good the movie actually is. Besides being a cautionary tale, GOJIRA also happens to be a genuinely well-crafted giant monster movie- the best at the time, perhaps, since the original KING KONG. Like the live-action GIGANTOR of just several years ago (not to mention the aforementioned GODZILLA), GOJIRA effectively conveys a GIANT in motion; that it was done and done so effectively more than half a century past (and without cgi) is just one of the many things that makes this a truly unique movie.",positive
"After H bomb testing in the pacific, ships start to go missing and a remote island is apparently under attack from a prehistoric monster. Japanese scientists hasten to find out just what is going on, what they find is Gojira, and he is mightily hell bent on destruction...next stop Tokyo.Gojira is such an influential film, it has spawned many sequels, remakes, copyists, and numerous homages, and of course there is two versions of this film for the viewer to choose from. The American version is a decent enough watch, it has integrated Raymond Burr into this original versions plot, and although it's unintentionally funny at times, it holds up pretty well as a no brainer piece of fluff. But it fails to compare to this original Ishirô Honda classic because this has a wonderful ambiance of fear at its heart, coming some 10 years after the Hiroshima bomb, the Japanese audiences of the time would surely have noted the heavy aura of destruction seaming through the picture. Watching it today, now that it's restored in all its original glory, is still a memorable and exhilarating experience, the build up is perfect, we are practically on the edge of our seats waiting to glimpse the giant atomic creature, and when he/it/she shows up for the first time, it gives us a truly memorable classic piece of cinema. Sadly the film is hampered a touch by a meandering romantic sub-plot, but the performances (notably Takeshi Shimura) are very engaging, while Akira Ifkube's score is poignantly perfect.As man in a rubber suit movies go, Gojira has no peers, it's smart, fun, and above all else, memorable. 8/10",positive
"After having watched the original Japanese version of Godzilla, a.k.a. ""Gojira"", for the first time (strangely never officially released in the US with English subtitles for over 50 years) and then watching a bit of the American studio version (aka ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" with Raymond Burr), I could only come to one minor conclusion. The original Japanese version destroys the American one. Stomps on it, breathes radioactive fire on it, and obliterates it with extreme prejudice. After this viewing, the American version is laid waste, just as Godzilla lays waste to urban Japan.The original Japanese Godzilla is in fact a cautionary tale concerning the proliferation of nuclear arms research and testing. However, the American version, which I enjoyed as a kid, purposefully left out more than the cautionary tale about the dangers of the Nuclear Age. It also cut references to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which ended the War in the Pacific, bringing a sudden and sobering end to World War II. The war was only 9 years in the past when Godzilla (aka Gojira) was released in Japan in 1954, and only two years after the end of American occupation in Japan. However, the shortcomings of the American version doesn't end with Godzilla losing much of its political and social undertones. It loses much of its teeth as compared with the Japanese version. In the original, similar to Hollywood's ""King Kong"", the film employs a much more extended arc before the terrible face of Godzilla is finally revealed. Even before the monster's head is shown, we see giant legs stomping a village on an island. Much like ""King Kong"" in 1933 and later ""Jaws"" in 1975, the monster in the Japanese version reeks havoc on unsuspecting and innocent victims long before the audience actually sees the thing itself. There is much less build-up in the American version. (In Spielberg's ""Jaws"", the director had insisted the shark shouldn't be shown until nearly half-way into the film.) The other aspects of the Japanese original missing from the American version concern the extended political debates. The characters are dealing with moral dilemmas which are even greater than the monster itself. The story involves, at first, the destruction of fishing boats and fisherman off the coast of Japan. Eventually the large reptilian creature, a cross between a t-rex and stegosaurus with the destructive and malevolent demeanor of Adolph Hitler is finally revealed crushing and annihilating everything in site. Four characters emerge who become the focus of the film: Hideto Ogata, a kind of coast guard/naval officer, his girlfriend, Emiko, Emiko's father, Professor Tanabe, and Dr. Serizawa, a reclusive scientist and inventor.Professor Tanabe and the young Ogata clash, because the older scientist wishes to study Godzilla while Ogata believes it needs to be destroyed before it destroys Japan and possibly the rest of the world. The young lovers have a mutual friend, Serizawa, who sports a patch over his eye which was lost during World War II. The scientist has a secret which he reveals to Emiko but insists she swears she will never reveal it. Eventually, Ogata learns of the secret, but the secret itself presents a moral dilemma which fits in with the rhetoric of the rest of the film.A brilliant film, which is as much a cautionary tale as a monster movie. The political overtones which permeate as much as Godzilla's destructive power play a large part in what the original version is really about but sadly lacking from the Americanized version. The large hulking creature which demolishes civilization may represent the potential horrors of the nuclear age as it does simply as a roller-coaster scary monster. Unlike American monster films, in which the monsters are very separate and deserve destruction, Godzilla appears to be something not from without but from within. The real horror of the original is that Godzilla may have been created by the human race, albeit inadvertently.",positive
"With the newest Godzilla opening tonight, I though I would revisit the one that started it all.The devastating bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima still a fresh memory, and Godzilla served as a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear weapons. In fact, the opening scene where the monster attacks a shipping vessel was a direct reference to a real-life incident: a Japanese tuna fishing boat, the Lucky Dragon 5, was accidentally contaminated by the fallout of an American atomic bomb test in the Bikini Atoll.The film was good enough to be nominated for Best Picture by the Japan Movie Association, though it ultimately lost to Seven Samurai.A remarkably humane and melancholy drama. Its rampaging radioactive beast, the poignant embodiment of an entire population's fears, became a beloved international icon of destruction, spawning almost thirty sequels. A thrilling, tactile spectacle that continues to be a cult phenomenon.",positive
"Godzilla (1954) marks the start of a whole new film industry for Japan and years of films for cult junkies and generations of youngster who have fell in love with the radioactive monster. The first film was made nine years after the near destruction of Japan during the aftermath of World War II. A new monster was created for the silver screen (based entirely on the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Years of meddling around splitting atoms and trying to harness radioactive energy has caused the earth to create a new type of natural disaster. It's name is Godzilla and it resembles a giant mutated dinosaur that's nearly indestructible. What has created Godzilla and what can stop him? People flee in horror as the rampaging beast levels cities and flattens the Japanese islands. At a loss for any practical answers, the government decides to use and experimental weapon on Godzilla. The weapon's creator takes the device himself and faces the homicidal behemoth. The two adversaries face-off and KA-BOOM!!! no one is left standing, the world is safe......for now!Don't fret none because Godzilla will be back for many more film installments, cartoons, comic-books and toys! A few years later, Godzilla would fight America's own monster King Kong in a free-fer-all battle royale. But seriously, Godzilla was a metaphor for America's wanton use of a deadly weapon that no one has ever seen before. The deployment of said device on Japan only adds fuel to the fire. Keep in mind the horror the citizens of Japan must have felt when intense heat, fall-out and death rained up those two ill fated cities.Highly recommended, it's one of the essentials.",positive
"The first Godzilla/Gojira film stands head-and-shoulders above the others because it is such a serious motion picture  both in its stark depiction of the devastation caused by Godzilla (which evokes the effects of the Hiroshima blast) and in the morally complex performances by a brilliant ensemble cast.  And, oddly enough, the oldest Godzilla film has the best visuals, thanks to a fortuitous combination of inventive photography, moody lighting, wondrous miniature sets, and one of the best-looking Godzilla costumes ever.  Therefore, I feel quite strongly that the first film, Gojira, is not only the best Godzilla film ever, but one of the best movies ever made.  Period.  (And it is not out on Region 1 DVD in its original format!!!!!)  The other Godzilla films, in comparison, are all just fun action movies (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Still, the best sequels make some attempt to continue the first film's tradition of making important social and political statements with the human storyline.  For example, GMK (2001) has a fascinating perspective on contemporary Japan's view of WWII, while Godzilla versus King Ghidora (1991) is a wonderfully wicked skewering of 1990s America (which hated and feared Japan's economic power).The American version of Gojira (1954) currently out on DVD has been dubbed into English and features new footage of Raymond Burr inserted into the original.  While this English-language version helped make the film accessible to me as a child, and helped open me up to the joys of foreign-make films, I do think that the original, subtitled version should be made available to the general public on DVD. After all, the dubbing is characterized by often inept translating and acting, and Raymond Burr - while offering a fine performance as far as it goes - is not operating on the same level as the original cast. And, even though I have a childhood affection for Raymond Burr's character, I must be forced to admit that, from the perspective of a modern-day film buff, the American reworking of the original is a terrible violation of a Japanese classic and should not be the only version of the movie out on DVD.  A nice 3-disc DVD set with both versions of the film and commentaries on the alterations (a la the Criterion Collection Brazil set) is in order.",positive
"A ship explodes and sinks near the coast of Japan. Soon more mysterious catastrophes occur. Navy officer Ogata gets involved in the cases surrounding these incidents. Meanwhile a village on Odo island near Japan is attacked at night during a rainstorm by a mysterious, giant creature. One of the elders tells a scary story from his youth about ""Gojira"", a giant, horrible monster from the seas. Then scientists, led by Dr. Yamane, arrive in the village to investigate what happened. Based on Dr. Yamane's discoverings, Japanese media start to report about the giant monster. Dr. Yamane and Ogata, who is in love with Emiko, Yamane's daughter, watch in horror as Gojira/Godzilla appears in mainland Japan and attacks Tokyo. Every measure taken by scientists and the army fails, as the giant, dinosaur-like creature attacks Japan's largest city two times, destroying everything with his radioactive breath. Yes, Gojira is the consequence of the A-bombs that hit Japan during the recent war, come back to life because of them. When the monster leaves the burning city, panic and tragedy is everywhere, the hospitals are filled with wounded and dying people and crying children. Hopelessness once again fills people's heart, and shocked Emiko breaks a promise: She tells Ogata of her cousin, scientist Daisuke Serizawa (who loves Emiko too), and his well-protected secret. It's called the oxygen-destroyer, and it is the most horrible weapon ever created by mankind. Now it's the last and only hope against Godzilla, and it's use will seal Dr. Serizawa's fate...So goes the story of ""Gojira"", one of the two greatest classics of Japanese cinema (the other being ""Shichinin no samurai"", made the same year by the same film studios and even featuring some of the same actors - like Takashi Shimura). There are still some people thinking of this as a ""B"" movie - they are as wrong as one can be. Made by Tôhô Eiga Company, Japan's largest movie company, that had to stop two other big projects in order to finish work on ""Gojira"", it became the most expensive Asian movie ever made at the time of it's release, costing 62'893'455 Yen. Back then, this was around US-$ 1'000'000. Surrounded by a tragic case in which a fisherman died because of radioactivity, the film became a gigantic success in Japan (and later in the US, too). Otherwise, Tôhô studios would have collapsed because of the film's costs, if it's true what I heard. Fortunately, this never happened! Instead, it became one of the most popular Japanese films ever, and rightly so, because the film is a timeless masterpiece. Cut to shreds in every version seen outside of Japan, this refers to the original Japanese version only!! The Americanized version is one of the worst: Removing half of the original footage, it includes senseless new scenes (shot in one day!) and still runs 16 mins shorter than the original version at 96 mins.! But the original film, being one of the most anti-American movies ever made with it's metaphoric message, was impossible to release in the USA... The one and only version to see is the Japanese one. It's, without a doubt, one of the best SF/horror films ever.",positive
"I should start this off stating that growing up, I loved Godzilla series. I obviously grew up watching the films where he would battle other monsters and was a defender of the human race. It wasn't until I got a little bit older and talked to my father who really only likes this one and some of the newer ones, especially the ones where Godzilla is a villain. To get into this review, American nuclear weapons testing results in the creation of a seemingly unstoppable, dinosaur-like beast.This film doesn't waste any time getting into it. We see a shipping vessel be destroyed in the middle of the ocean. A distress call was sent out and Hideto Ogata (Akira Takarada) takes the call. He apologizes to Emiko Yamane (Momoko Kôchi) as he has to cancel plans with her. His ship is then destroyed as well. Others try to rescue the survivors, but any ship that goes there is destroyed.On a nearby island, they see a raft coming toward them. On it is Ogata. There is a local legend of a sea creature called Godzilla. Some of the elders think that the bad fishing is caused by it and that it will come ashore soon. That night a typhoon hits, but there seems to be something bigger inside of it. A professor is called in, the father of Emiko, Kyohei (Takashi Shimura). It is during there investigation they learn there are giant footprints that are radioactive. In one of the prints, they find a creature that was supposed to be long extinct. They also get a glimpse of the giant lizard as well.Kyohei believes that the creature was in an underwater cave and that underwater H-bomb testing released it. He also thinks that it has a natural defense to radiation. There is a scientist that the local reporter wants to talk to as they think he might have a way to stop it. He asks to speak with Emiko who was engaged to be married to him. The scientist is Daisuke Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata). He refuses to talk to the reporter, but shows something to Emiko. He swears her to secrecy though.Things get much worse when Godzilla comes on to the mainland and destroys cities. Everything they try to do fail and it just leaves a path of destruction. It crushes them underfoot, with his tail and using his fire-breath. The only reprieve is that it goes back into the ocean to rest. Is there a way to stop this monster before he destroys Tokyo and all of Japan?Now I hadn't watched this film since college. I actually decided in a short time to watch the Japanese version as well as the American version where they add random scenes of Raymond Burr. For this, I saw in my local theater as part of their Horror 101 series the Japanese version again. The biggest take away from this film is how bleak it is.I want to start with this film isn't too long after the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan. There is actually a woman who states that she survived one of the attacks by fleeing before it happened. I think it's important to bring up, because I think the country is still in a state of depressing and shock. The film really speaks out against the use of these types of weapons. It is actually stating we need to stop using them as the final line. Going with that, it frees Godzilla from its underwater cavern and has immunity to the radioactivity as well. It doesn't really shy away from being an anti-war and anti-bomb film even being anti-American since they feel these are two things that are associated with the country. There is even a reluctance to use the weapon that could destroy Godzilla, because the scientist doesn't trust humanity to not pursue using it against their fellow man. This gives it a feel of the scientists who developed the atomic bomb and their reluctance toward they created.To get to some of the realism of this one, I do think that there's a possibility that there could be underwater caves in the ocean that could house creatures like this. I also could just see them living down there since it goes so deep that we haven't gotten close to exploring down there. Do I think the creature could do the things that Godzilla can? Not necessarily, but this could be a creature this size for sure. I think the abilities go back to making Godzilla an almost unstoppable monster and make it to where we don't think he can be stopped.I did have a slight issue with the pacing. I thought it started off well and it builds tension as Godzilla gets closer and closer to mainland. It does well in building that bleak feel as well when everything they try to stop it fails. There is a section though in the latter second act, early third act that it hit a lull. We get a lot of the aftermath of the attacks and trying to convince Serizawa to help that I lost some interest. I do feel that the ending is a bit forced and gets explained a bit too much as well. It doesn't ruin the film, but I think it hurts the pacing a bit.Acting though is something that I found to be good. Takarada is pretty good as our hero. What is interesting about him is that he works for a shipping company. He is a good guy, but he does get a bit rude to the man he wants to be his father-in-law. Takarada wants to destroy Godzilla where Kyohei wants to study it. I do like Shimura and can see where he is coming from for his role. This is a monster that hasn't been seen for millions of years and we could learn a lot from it. The problem though is that it is odd, because I don't know how he proposes to actually do it. I like this is anti-war, pro-science and animal film though. Kôchi was solid in her role and I like Hirata as well. The rest of the cast round out the film pretty well also.The effects for this film are quite interesting. They did a great job of using models and toys to bring these things to life. When the film was made, everything had to be pretty much be done practically or tricks with the film. There are times you can see that they aren't real, but I really didn't mind it. It looks better than some things done with CGI in my opinion. I love seeing Godzilla destroy these things and even though I know it is a guy in a suit, I think there is more of realism to it. I thought the look of the monster as also solid and the film was shot well.Last thing to touch on before wrapping this up is the score and sound design. I do think they go a bit heavy handed with the thudding of Godzilla walking and there are even times when he's in the water that it wouldn't be heard like it is. I do let that slide, because it gives a feeling of foreboding with each one. The roar of the monster is great and it seems like how it would sound. I do think there are some good musical selections that enhance the scenes as well, contributing at times to that bleak feel of the film for sure.Now with that said, I really enjoy this film. I don't think it is perfect, but it does a lot of things right and the underlying message is one that is still relevant today. There are some slight pacing issues for me, but I think the acting, effects and score of the film make up for that. The effects don't always look real, but I will prefer the man in a suit, models and toys over CGI any day. I will warn you that this version was in Japanese, but there is the American version that is out there. I have seen that before and it is just as solid. It is in black and white though, so keep that in mind. I find this to be a really good movie.",positive
"This film is an amazing and brilliant production even if it had been made today. The fact that it was made in '54 and not too long after the dropping of the A-Bombs on Japan; makes it that even more amazing, interesting and emotionally touching.You can see how it has served as a blueprint and a template for so many films of this genre. Many have followed in its footprints but they have come up short.One make think that on the surface it is a frivolous superficial monster flick but they would be horribly wrong. The story line, the symbolism, the acting, the technical aspects and the general production of this masterpiece is A-PLUS.",negative
"I thought that I was a Godzilla (Gojira) fan until I saw this film in the original Japanese. The U.S. re-edit, which was good, left out a whole section of the story and an entire anti-nuclear testing subtext. In the American version, Raymond Burr is obviously the main character, with a Japanese policeman as a kind of side kick which actually detracts much from the original story line without adding much except a (then) somewhat familiar American face to the cast.The original storyline is much richer, with better interaction amongst the main characters, namely Professor Yamane, his daughter, Emiko, and her arranged fiancé Dr. Serizawa, as well as her true love interest, Salvage Officer Ogata. the above named characters have a much more fully developed relationship than in the heavily edited American version. One reason for the loss of story and subtext was the running time, 74 minutes in the U.S. and about 97 in the original Japanese.Another element missing from the American version was the whole radiation angle, it was barely mentioned, almost as an afterthought, while in the original Japanese, it was a central and recurring theme. Even two films later in the Japanese version of KING KONG vs. GODZILLA, it is pointed out that Gojira is a true monster born of radiation.This film is a very rewarding find if you watch it in the original Japanese, with subtitles of course. It is also the best of a long line of kaiju films that I've seen. All in all a very good film. If you must see it and cannot find the Japanese version, the American one does keep much of the epic scope of the original and is quite good in its own right, but the original, in my opinion, is far superior.",positive
"The very first, and in many ways the best, of all GODZILLA films. If you've never seen the original Japanese version or have only been familiar with the more juvenile sequels out of the 1960s, you're missing a very good and serious horror film with a message.Godzilla (Gojira) is an ancient creature who is awakened as a result of scientific experimentation with atom bombs. He destroys ships at sea with radioactive breath and ultimately sets foot on Tokyo ground, destroying the whole city and tragically altering the lives of human beings forever in the wake of his rampage. Only one cautious scientist, equipped with his own highly secret weapon of ending this creature's reign of destruction, can either help or hurt mankind by intervening with his invention. The movie is starkly filmed in gloomy black and white; it's very depressing, non-humorous and grimly despairing. The subject matter is taken very seriously and includes the element of human suffering, such as in a very moving scene where a desperate mother embraces her crying daughter amidst all the devastation and whispers that mother and child will ""soon join daddy"".GOJIRA is not a ""perfect"" film; it can occasionally drag just a bit, but it's still well considerable as a truly ""great monster movie"" and is required viewing for all fans of this genre. It is preferable to the Americanized edition with Raymond Burr, which is widely known as GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS. ***1/2 out of ****",positive
"I have had the good fortune to have seen this film. This is the original version. No Raymond Burr, no crystal clear miss-matched scenes, even more destruction. This is a much darker, cynical film than the one I grew up with. It has yet to be equalled for the sheer wonder it evokes and the dead on documentary look to each frame. It is played absolutely straight by some fine actors. The actor playing the older professor also played the lead samurai in ""The Seven Samurai"" the same year. Not for a single second does anyone doubt that this is happening to the characters. It was not until the 1989 Godzilla film that the special effects were equalled. It runs over 15 minutes longer than the Burr version. This is 15 more minutes of menace to savour. A must for any SF film fan. Hard to find, but well worth it. I give this a ""7"" out of ""10.""",positive
"The original Japanese version. Without a doubt, the best movie ever made. Filmed in glorious black and white, this first Godzilla film has a somber feel which heightens a very real sense of suspense and terror. The terror is palpable throughout, as one attack follows another and the death toll begins to rise almost exponentially. The anguish of the survivors is realistically portrayed and very believable, and the entire film stands as a credible allegory for the horror of nuclear war.The movie itself is not about godzilla but about the oxygen destroyer. The oxygen destroyer is the key to this movie. The oxygen destroyer is the only way to kill godzilla but the fact that mankind will use it as a weapon of mass destruction as a scientists stuck between whats right and wrong and it leads us to the emotional climax between man vs monster.The best thing about this movie is the music by Akira Ifukube. Its the best musical score i have ever heard. It gives you an eerie sense of whats going on. If i had to choose between gojira and the original king kong i have to go with gojira. Gojira gives a message that no other film has ever done before or after is that godzilla is the metaphor of the aftermath of using nuclear weapons.And thats my gut feelingGreg Gutfeld",positive
Pay your respects to the original movie that started it all.,positive
"Inspired by the huge success of Warner Bros' The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Toho set out to make its own monster movie - with a creature that manifested a deep concern among the Japanese. While it is easy to laugh at the tongue-in-cheek sequels of the 1960s and 1970s, the original Godzilla is actually a pretty somber film. Shot in stark black and white, Godzilla's first rampage is dark and brooding - a sincere attempt to deal with the serious issues of the period, mainly the nuclear arms race in the aftermath of World War II. Before he became a beloved icon, Godzilla was a colossal nightmare - a physical manifestation of a nuclear bomb. The solemn and thought-provoking Japanese original version is offered here in this set, along with the 1956 American version starring Raymond Burr. Also included are informative audio commentaries and featurettes. This is the perfect movie to start your Godzilla collection.",positive
"It's been fifty years since Ishiro Honda and the gang at Toho made the first Godzilla movie, and looking back on it, it's plain to see why this film has become more than just a cult sensation. It's mix of raw human emotion, fantastical story, and menacing precautionary messages help to deliver one of the silver screens greatest films. Akira Ifkube's foreboding score adds just the right amount of dark edge to Honda's masterpiece,as does Akihiko Hirata's performance as jaded scientist, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa. The suitmation and set designs used in this classic are superb as well, giving a certain level of realism missing from many later monster films. And, of course, veteran actor Takashi Shimura exceeds all expectations as Dr. Yamane.Looking back on this film, taken in it's entirety and without the added American scenes, Godzilla (Gojira) truly is a film that will last the ages.",positive
"A great movie that is a bit underrated it should be at least at the Top 250. I love this film, the effects are brilliant for the time it was mede. It makes it's sequels look silly and goofy in front of it. It has dark atmosphere and a bit of terror. I want to watch it again and again. Showa gamera's nothing in front of this film only Gamera 3 passes it because it has directed in a better way. It's one of my favorite kaiju films. ShodaiGoji is one of the best Godzilla designs ever. It should have been number #2 after Gamera 3. One of my favorite Godzilla films. Legendary's Godzilla is nothing in front of the original Japanese Masterpiece! I hope in the future one film like this will be released again!",positive
"4/4One of the best monster films out there,but my favorite personally. This movie not only changed Japanese pop culture but also American. I have always loved Godzilla but none of the 27 sequels have ever come close to how haunting this film is. This is because how seriously they take the film. It not just a film where there is a creature that pops up. It adds a story behind it which makes the film antiwar. Even though the film only has a guy in a rubber suit they do the shots as to make the creature seem big in size. They do this by using different camera angles.Gojira is to me a masterpiece because Toho has done something unique with a monster movie and used a good size budget, well it was at the time.",positive
"Gojira is definitely better than ""Godzilla."" I was completely naive to the fact that Godzilla was not the original version of this film and I have to say, seeing Gojira really changed my mind on the whole reputation of the Godzilla series. First of all, to me, this version is not cheesy at all, in fact I found it to be quite sad. This is a form of the horror/thriller genre that hits close to home. In this generation, natural disasters are all too familiar for people around the globe. Obviously, the monster is not ""natural"" but it creates a metaphor that really pinches a never in viewers. I viewed this film right before the devastating earthquake in Japan so I can't help but think this film was foreshadowing in some way. Now, do not expect stunning special effects or CGI creatures. I actually thought that Ishiro Honda did a great job at not making the monster sequences look too cheesy. I never felt like I was watching a poorly made, outdated film. Now, I can see why the U.S version ""Godzilla"" was so cheesy seeing as Raymond Burr wasn't even there at the original shoot! I would not go as far as to say that this is the best movie of all time (as some super-fans might say_ but I definitely think this is the best giant monster film. Besides being a great monster movie, the film also manages to make a social statement on the atomic bomb era and show the possible effects of an outbreak. The humans become sick, some of them die and this for me was the most frightening part because it really could happen. Although a monster coming to life from the atomic radiation is highly unlikely, the effects that Ishiro Honda shows are quite realistic and quite terrifying.",positive
"Among the kaiju diaspora, there is constant disagreement worthy of a Star Trek convention (not necessarily a compliment) on every minor detail of a film, running the gamut from aesthetics in cinematography to monster originality to th ""realness"" or ""fakeness"" of the godzilla suit in this or that film. The general conversation on Kaiju rarely simmers above that appropriate in a sandbox. However, almost instinctively, each kaiju fan when asked will rank this at the top of the list the genre has produced, glowing remarks follow about its tone, its somber atmosphere, the general sad feeling one felt and of course the importance of the subtext of the whole screenplay. I always find it odd how uniformly they all take their hats off at the mention of this film, like a Casablanca or Citizen Kane of the giant monster movie.The plot is well known and so I wont detail it. Borrowing much from its inspiration ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" and to a lesser extent ""King Kong"", it begins with mysterious happenings at sea, reports by islanders are muddled with ancient mysticism and the government goes to check out the evidence. In the midst of this is a love triangle, all linked to apposing sides on the matter of the devastation. The film is above all an anti-war film, the inspiration for much of the film was director Ishiro Honda's journey through Hiroshima in 1945. Godzilla is a symbol, the incarnation really of unstoppable, unreasonable death. Towering over Tokyo and moving slowly across he is war at its core=war against civilians. There are subtle notes scattered all over, the scene where parliament erupts into a shouting match for example, the scientists, men of reason are heard and quickly forgotten, the politicians go on bickering (note also that Serizawa is also a scientist), it is obvious Honda placed little hope on politicians.I think the general appeal of the film is partly warranted, partly nominal, and partly unavoidable. The warranted aspect is present to anyone who has taken the time to see it more than twice. The writing has been derided by many a critic, for example Roger Ebert (I originally intended to make this review a rebuttal to his) but I found it eloquent, the characters have a sense of restraint, they always seemed urged to say more than they do. I also like the cinematography, the vast number of shots of the beast are from below, from afar, in the distance within a corner like a silhouette figure shining in dark black waters and sky. Sadly its a form never again taken up by the genre, preferring a bland approach, mid sized shots on the center of action so as to not miss out on the tumbling creatures, and even more recently is to ape what Hollywood generally finds to work (the simple angle shots which I think come standard on every camera by this point).The nominal aspect is the general tendency of people to treat the older movie as above criticism, to be stashed in shrink wrap and on ice. It is sacrilege to speak ill of the original, the ""Masterpiece"", the serious toned grandfather of all that is rubbery and rampaging. Quick example, I remember noting in passing how I felt Akira Ifukube's score sounded hoarse and almost amateurish in the film, and that the themes took life with Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964). Immediately he defended the score, calling it the best in the whole series from what I gather for no better reason then that it was the original, and the masters work cannot be challenged. Many a film fan will be quick to defend ""Phantom of the Opera"" or ""Nosferatu"", and with justified historical and technical reasons, which would be much more entertaining than watching those films again, I may be schooled on the context of them but the context can do little to bring it back from the depths of anachronism.Finally black and white just looks glorious. As many know color dates a film, but black & white always looks classy and supersedes any particular era, it looks as good in 1932 as it does in 2008, violence is given meaning by simply moving through the contrast, a man walking down an empty street is a non literal expression of his life and thoughts, in color its an extended scene editing mistake. For ""Gojira"" a monster crushing a city in B & W is a commentary on violence, in color a summer popcorn romp at a multiplex, many-a-time color has no patience for subtext.In my view, it is the greatest kaiju film, and one of the best films of a golden age of Japanese cinema.10/10",positive
"The movie that started it all rightfully deserves to be called a classic. The characters have great development and the special effects, for the time, are really well done. Critics, unfortunately, look at the special effects when watching the Rialto re-release and expect SPFX up to the standards of the 1953 version of War of the Worlds. This movie had a limited budget because at the very same time, they were shooting Seven Samurai. I thought the American version was good, but when I saw the Japanese version at last, it was a completely different experience. The characters were more alive and the extra footage made the film make more sense. After this, 27 sequels followed. Some good, some bad. All of them would not have been possible without this milestone in movie monster cinema. It's not my personal favorite, but whenever I get my next chance, I will see it again.",positive
"There are many people who look at this movie, even in its original, uncut, undubbed form, ignore what it's saying and take it for nothing more than a standard 1950s monster movie. I will admit that on the outside it does seem very much like one of the many monster-on-the-loose films which were common at the time, and the theme of mankind's misuse of atomic weapons was overdone in many such films. Here, however, there are major differences which set this movie apart from the others.The prolonged scenes of Godzilla's victims in the hospitals are disturbingly reminiscent of what really happened in the aftermaths of the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki not even ten years before the film's release. The memory of such tragedies was still relatively fresh in the minds of many Japanese moviegoers and thus the message was conveyed more eloquently than the usual route of a scientist and his monologue on the misuse of atomic weapons commonly found in American monster movies at the time. Most of the serious portrayal of this theme was removed from the Americanized version of the film, as American audiences would likely be confused by such a seriously conveyed message.Aside from its deep allegorical meaning, it is also a well-made film. Too many critics put down Tsuburaya's special effects, referring to them as cheap and quickly done. While not convincing by today's standards, the effects are exceptional for the time period and should be regarded with more respect. Another factor to be recognized is Ifukube's wonderful music, which enhances the film's emotional impact. There is also a great cast, made up almost entirely of actors who would return for many other monster outings from Toho (including Kurosawa veteran Takashi Shimura). Also to be noted is Haruo Nakajima's masterful performance of the titular beast. The characters, especially the tragic hero Serizawa, are very memorable. Honda achieves some incredible work here with his direction, creating a wonderfully dark, tense atmosphere.All these factors are combined to create what happens to be my all-time favorite film. A monster movie with as much meaning as this one you'll never find.",positive
"Ever since I was a child, the Godzilla character was one of my favorites. I have seen many Godzilla films but today I have been privileged to have seen where it all began. Godzilla did not begin as a character in a kid's movie. This movie, I must say is NOT for young children. It is very much a mature film, an allegory for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As a movie, it is a very dark and tragic one, with numerous references to Japan's suffering during the Second World War. The acting was top-notch as were the special effects (for the time). The music seemed to underscore the ominous nature of the film. I can only imagine what the reaction of the Japanese people was when they first saw this movie 64 years ago. The rest of the world should watch this to see what nuclear power can really do and to see what Japan went through during World War II.9/10. The first and the best (and should have been the only) Godzilla movie that has ever been released.",positive
"Gojira is much more than I had previously imagined. Having never seen the original version of the film I envisioned the film to be a cheesy and entirely not serious film, the subject of many parodies and jokes. What was presented, however, was a commentary of the fears of the effects of radiation in Japan. The film is shot from a lower height than most, Ishiro Honda's intention of it appearing to the audience from the position of someone sitting down with the characters. This technique is effective at placing the audience within the context of Japanese culture and customs. The film is really more of a drama or a love story at times, while an adventure at others, than a film simply about a sea monster taking over the country. Gojira will surprise you with its stunning visuals and ability to pull you in. Despite my first impression of what the film would be like, I found myself quite enjoying every aspect of it. The image of Gojira (Godzilla) will make you laugh when standing away from the film, however in the context of the film the audience find's themselves actually ignoring the majority of the monster's primitive image. The film approaches the character gently, not over introducing the creature, and for the most part using clever techniques to make it seem less like a comical or cartoon-like dinosaur. The acting throughout the film is well done, and from it arises a love triangle between the female lead and two men, a scientist who loves her, and a man who wants to marry her. In the backdrop of the film, Gojira's damage to the country shows the devastating effects of radiation as the injured and dead are gathered and many mourn losses of family. Gojira perhaps represents the possible problems arising from atomic development and usage. The creature is ruthless, however the professor in the film wishes that the people would let Gojira live, and at times you begin to feel sympathy for the professor's wishes, given the amount of dedicated work that is done on other dangerous species of animal, as well as the rarity of such a creature existing. Overall, the film was exciting, surprising, and quite entertaining.",positive
I think that this movie is really good it has a very dark tone to it and I think it's just really dark and depressing at the same time is very sad tale and it shows us the ways of nuclear what happened in 1945 the bombing of Hiroshima in about the nuclear attacks and I save this movie shows a really good example that it's just it's very dark in the pressing and it shows the ways of nuclear could cause into very bad problems a really good movie last words 10 out of 10,positive
"(Flash Review)This was what started the Godzilla legacy, spin-offs and parodies. Probably influenced from the atomic bomb blasts and wondering what effect could come from the depths of the waters that surround Japan. This was also the first large scale spectacle movie created by Japan. Kicking off the Godzilla story, we learn that Godzilla was created from or exposures to Hydrogen Bomb tests. Once he emerges from the sea, how to kill him is the objective. There is one weapon known only to that a single scientist that he created but he is reluctant to use it as he feels it cannot trusted to be known to the world as the fear is it will be used for politically motivated massive human destruction. How will Japan defeat Godzilla? This was pure 50s fun with tons realistic model sets destroyed by Godzilla and some footage of real bombs exploding under water. See history and how this monster was born!",positive
"I recently attended a screening of ""Gojira"" at a local theater. I have seen it many times on DVD and Bluray, but this was my first opportunity to see it on the big screen. The film was just beautiful - the print itself cleaned up and the soundtrack sounding much better than I had expected it to. The film is a real treat to see on the big screen, as one can see greater attention to detail. There are some gorgeously framed and filmed compositions of the characters and the emotional context of the film - the triangular love story set against a very strong anti-war statement - was actually quite palpable and had a greater impact. The acting was all first-rate (some of the cast had already worked with Akira Kurosawa), the nighttime attacks actually nightmarish and the musical score by Akira Ifukube is, in my opinion, one of the greatest scores ever written for cinema. The film is, at times, very uncomfortable to watch: the radiation burns of the survivors in triage, the mother clutching her children as they are about to die, the heroic death of one of the major characters, the camera pan of a devastated Tokyo mimicking film footage of the burned and shattered remains of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The only things that didn't work on the big screen were the jet fighters - one could easily see the wires. Other than that, I truly feel the film is a masterpiece and one to treasure.",positive
"** Spoiler alert** One of the best action, horror films of all time. I greatly enjoyed Gojira and I highly recommend this film over any remakes. Ishiro Honda captures everything from suspense to fear and displays good quality props. Gojira begins with suspense as a Japanese vessel mysteriously encounters a mechanical failure and disappears. Another Japanese vessel is deployed with hopes of finding the other ship, but it also disappears. The suspense builds with one of the worst storms hitting the island, but many islanders are skeptical that what they experienced was not a storm. The town is soon confronted with the great island monster, Gojira, the cause of the previous storm. Fear is quickly spread throughout the island while monster continues to destruct the cities. I found the destruction and mayhem during this time very realistic. In addition, a great deal of time and effort was put into the props especially since the monster is not as cheesy as one would imagine. The movie thickens as one of the main characters is torn between two loves. She is challenged with telling the other love of her life that she plans to marry their friend, but is unable to under the circumstances caused by Gojira. She soon becomes challenged by keeping her past love's invention a secret knowing that it could save the cities and many lives. Meanwhile, the military is attempting to put the monster out of service through any method. It is almost comedic the way the military attempts to kill Gorjia with electric lines and gun fire, but it also captures the struggles and disbelief the citizens are facing with their failed attempts of eliminating the monster. The frustration is very apparent of the people. In fact many of them give up in out running the monster and pray with their families as he kills them. The movie comes to an epic finale with the inevitable death of the island monster. This is one of the best movies I have seen of this time and period. It is worth watching more than once.",positive
"Godzilla or otherwise known a Gojira was the debut of the legendary titular character and arguably one of the most high profile pieces of Japanese cinema to date.It tells the story of this gigantic creature coming out of the ocean and going on the warpath after being woken by nuclear explosions. The humans argue as to what to do with the situation, kill or study. But how do you kill something that big and that has already withstood massive radioactive blasts?Godzilla is very ahead of its time and though the sfx are badly dated they look great for something made in the 1950's. For the most part it looks and is acted really quite well, though our leading lady was seven shades of awful.One of the movies biggest flaws is its pacing. The movie doesn't have a traditional beginning, middle and end in fact the finale really creeps on you and isn't all that great itself.Regardless of its flaws Godzilla has to be considered a classic that launched a franchise that is still ongoing over 6 decades later.The Good:Visually ahead of its timeThe Bad:Godzilla logistics make no senseOdd moments of literally no audioSome ropey editingWeak finaleThings I Learnt From This Movie:If nukes don't work on something, try bullets, if that doesn't get a pitchfork?Japan makes strong bridges!Japanese women are renound for overacting to fish sufferingPrayer accomplishes nothing, oh wait I already knew that",negative
"The DARKEST, MOST EMOTIONAL, and TRAGIC MOVIE EVER!!!! not to mention THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! I've always wanted to see the original Gojira, and now that i've seen it, i am in total AWE. It makes me look at the king of the monsters in a completely different way. What sets this movie apart is the fact that Godzilla is a metaphor/stand in for the atomic bomb. Not another monster movie with a hero that slays the monster at the end, but a movie where the one who defeats (or according to Dr. Yamane MAY have defeated) has a huge decision and responsibility to make, not only that but actually shows the weight on his shoulders, instead of just being like ""hmmmm we got the one hand i can do this, but on the other hand i could do that, i think i'll do that"" instead in the moment of decision he is pulling his hair out, sweating and it looked like he was about to cry too. Then the innocent people caught in the rampage, they show more emotion then running and screaming like having scenes where they are caught in claustrophobic tight spots watching in horror while trying to hide, and instead of most giant monster movies, shows what happens to some of them like people being torched by Godzilla's fiery breath, and shows the aftermath of what happened to the injured and dieing. Without a doubt an on-screen spectacle.",positive
"Godzilla. It's a common household name in America, but in Japan, it's the equivalent of cultural icons like Superman and Batman. Godzilla is a franchise more than 60 years in the making, with 29 films to it's credit and a whole world of spin offs, imitators, merchandise, and a massive fan base across the globe. But where did this sensation get it's start? We travel back to 1954, to see this film's big release day in Japan. At the time, nothing like it had ever been attempted in Japan. It struck people to their cores with it's nuclear allegorical storytelling and it's innovative special effects. It was such a hit it was released all across the world with overwhelming box office rates. It kicked off the tokusatsu rage in Japan and the countless imitators and cash ins flooded the market everywhere. The film itself is fantastic. Yes, it is dated, but all people should have an open mind when watching films. Mysterious ship disappearances akin to the Lucky Dragon incident occur, and scientists are sent to investigate an island which has been recently ravaged by a storm for survivors and answers. The natives, tell another story. The great monster known as Gojira destroyed their island. And thus, he appears. Rising over the hill, the great beast roars and sends the locals into a panic. We focus throughout the movie on four characters, Hideto Ogato, Emiko Yamane, Daisuke Serizawa, and Doctor Yamane. The relationship between these people and other people around them steadily grows more dramatic throughout the film as the situation gets more and more grim, making the characters believable and well thought out. The special effects certainly aren't very special today, but in japan, nobody had even tried something of that magnitude, and for a first try, they did a great job. Haruo Nakajima must be given credit for suffering inside the Godzilla suit. Serizawa's story is the most interesting of all to myself personally. He is caught in the love triangle with Hideto and Emiko, and is terrified to reveal a weapon more powerful than a nuclear bomb to stop Godzilla. This film is an absolute must see for all. It's an incredible achievement that stands the test of time and shall be remembered for generations to come.",positive
"Gojira (Godzilla) is a cautionary tale involving the Terrors of Nuclear warfare. In the original version this message is intact and left audiences in awe with its tale. While the American version, however did not silence the message but definitely muted it. Gojira is the best of all the Gojira movies, because it showed the raw power and devastation of our ways. It showed us the destruction of our own power. That is what makes Gojira so powerful and unyielding. With the images of a Devastated Tokyo and the suffering of the people after the first attack by the monster reminds us of the people who have suffered because of War. The Director Ishiro Honda in 1991, two years before his death, said that he always hoped Gojira (Godzilla) could help bring an end to nuclear testing and arms proliferation, but has continually lamented that he failed in his mission. And Gojira's messages is not more evident than it is now, in today's world. In 1954 a monster made form nuclear weapons arose and warned man-kind to extinguish the fire of war and weapons, but now in the year 2006 he just might awaken and devastate man-kind once again",positive
"This is the film, that inspired me to work in film... It was the first ever movie I ever watched. I found myself watching it over and over again. Terrified, yet amazed at the towering behemoth, I felt so much emotion, fear, intensity, depression, heat...it gave me nightmares, and I loved every second of it all! After learning that there was an entire series of Godzilla, I instantly got hooked...now I will always love what Big G puts on the screen...
 But of course I was too young to understand the true moral of this pop culture icon. As I grew wiser, I saw that there was more than just an atomic fire breathing beast, focusing on one thing...to flatten anything in it's way. No, I realized that it's a message, a reminder of war...that we are creating monsters, that we are destroying ourselves. That's what truly made this movie a masterpiece.",positive
"The 1954 Gorjira film is a master piece, with some effects that hold up pretty well. And an amazing mediator for Nuclear bombs that where used on Japan in the time. This truly is a great film and one I would greatly recommend veiwing in its original Japanese language with subtitles.",positive
"I adored the original version. It was suspenseful and the music was riveting. However, the Raymond Burr version, while I admit Raymond Burr was a great actor, was terrible. They took out one third of the movie (about thirty minutes shorter). The American version also started with a scene nearly an hour into this version! Please, give the original version a chance. It is a totally different movie. Even the starring actors are different. And the Japanese version had a plot. Not just any plot, a magnificent plot complete with a leading lady who I thought was just a nurse based on the other version. The American version was a crime against film-making. The Japanese was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen(and I have seen many, many great movies).",positive
"This is the first Gojira film. If you wish to watch it, only watch the original Japanese version. The ""Americanized"" version known as Godzilla: King of the Monsters, ruins it and adds disrupting scenes of an English-speaking news reporter in the middle of a Japanese movie. In it's original form, Gojira is a beautiful film. The soundtrack, the sound effects, the special effects, Godzilla's costume, the acting, it's so convincing that even 64 years later, it is still thrilling.
It is a surprisingly dark story, especially for a 1950's movie that has a guy in a big dinosaur-looking costume as the villain. The story, from the beginning, can pull you in. You can suspend your disbelief just enough to understand how terrifying the situation of the JSDF's (Japanese Self Defense Force) when fighting Godzilla. Here's this colossal being that came out of the ocean and stomped and breathed radioactive fire on Tokyo. What can you do against something like that?
Dr. Serizawa may have the answer to that but is very against using this answer for good reason.
If you want to see what all the hubbub is about Godzilla, start with this film and an open mind.",positive
"This is THE film. One of the best films you'll ever see. And it shows. It's one of the most popular films to come out of Japan this side of Seven Samuari. This film is not like its followers. It's not cheesy or kitchy. It's a serious political film that introduced one of the worlds biggest icons to the screen.THE SFX: The best of the times, and it still stands the test of time. The SFX in this film make you believe that a giant dinosaur is attacking Tokyo. He destroys the Diet Building, he does all these things that are realized grandly. I give the SFX 10/10.ACTING: Great acting, leveled only by the years earlier release, Seven Samuari. Most of all, one of the stars from that film returns to the screen to portray Dr. Yamane. 10/10 STORY: This is one of the most allegorical films you'll ever see, and it's got an ending that really makes you think as Serizawa kills himself along with Godzilla at the end of the film. It's a very sad ending that WILL tear you up. 10/10 See? This is a great film. Told ya. Back to the boards.",positive

"Ishiro Honda's Gojira is the original Japanese version of a film which would later be introduced to American audiences as the fully Americanized Gojira: King of the Monsters. Much was cut out and added to the American version - including Raymond Burr. http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0197521/usercommentsThe Americanization of the original film reduced the story to a standard Kaiju (fictional monster) film, and in some ways, was more profoundly influential on later Toho projects and other giant monster movies. But Gojira is much more than a big green lizard with radioactive halitosis and much more than a film about a big green lizard with radioactive halitosis stomping all over Tokyo. The film is dark, serious, frightening, and mythic. Something is burning ships off the coast of southeast Asia. A group of Ainu-like natives of a nearby island have myths which speak of a giant monster named Gojira, and though the creature which will eventually emerge from the sea is something entirely new and much more disturbing, the name sticks. When the creature first ventures onto the land, destroying a few of the villagers' huts, a paleontologist is brought to the scene to study the phenomenon. He discovers an enormous highly radioactive footprint - eventually leading him to believe that nuclear tests have caused a holdover from prehistoric times to become a major problem in the modern day. Of course, by the time all of this is figured out, Gojira is on his way to Tokyo, and a scientist who might have the ability to solve the problem permanently is too terrified to do what needs to be done - perhaps because he remembers Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many have discussed the metaphoric and symbolic aspects of this film, and certainly there is good reason to consider these elements. However, I am more concerned with the fact that, unlike so many of its descendants, Gojira demands interpretation and thought. The film's artistic integrity is just one of many reasons it remains solidly entertaining today. Suffice to say that the film is more of a social statement about the psychological state of Japan around 1954 than it is a political piece. The director and writer should be credited with providing an excellent build-up for the action scenes which, unusually, do not take place until more than half-way through the film. The characters are all believable, consistent, and nicely developed. And the acting is professionally accomplished. I was especially impressed with Momoko Kôchi. Also legendary for its special effects, the imagery of Gojira is so well done that it is still viable today - without CGI, a lot blue or green-screen work etc. Slow motion, great camera angles and miniatures - Toho trademarks - comprise the bulk of the special effects. Recommended",positive
"Gojira, or as we westerners (and fanboys) call him, Godzilla, is the epitome of mankinds worst mistake and, as shown later in Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, complete anhilator.  With a perfect cast (even when Raymond Burr scenes are put here and there, which are great for Americans messing with someone elses movie), and the continuously haunting score, and the Godzilla roar that still lives today.  Everything about this movie gives the feel of horror to all that Godzilla is.  The grainy sound  and filming give it the perfect documentary look, that films such as Platoon, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan use to win awards, and the dark grainy static that seem to cover all sounds, making human screams, burninb buildings, the perfect score (which sounds the best in the first), and ESPECIAlLY Godzilla's Roar, could not have been done any better except in the style they are in.  This explains why in the first one (and maybe Godzilla 1985) are the only films where Godzilla, his seeming innocence and anger born personality, and all of the things japan and the world suffered, truly shine out to our eyes.",positive
"***User-reviewer Emideon (""A legacy not dependant on platitudes, but well earned"", Emideon from Los Angeles, U.S.A., 13 July 2008) has an interesting commentary that he says began as a reply to Roger Ebert. Also, Brian Washington (""Why in God's Green Earth Isn't This Version Shown More?"", Brian Washington (Sargebri@att.net) from Los Angeles, California, 28 October 2003) adds insight to the film's anti-militarism message.*** Godzilla (""Gojira"", 1954, Japan, Ishiro Honda's), concerning the return of everyone's favorite amphibian monster, is very dark and emotionally complex. It is not the escapist, ""B-movie"" as suggested by the advertising for it. Ishiro Honda is said to have been inspired by a memorable visit to Hiroshima. The film's allegorical connection to the atomic bombs dropped by the US is barely concealed. (""Godzilla"" frequently refers to the H-bomb ""testing"" being conducted by the US in the Pacific. However, before the monster makes its appearance we see an investigation being conducted of a radioactive crater. It seems obvious that the crater refers to Hiroshima/Nagasaki. The trauma-filled hospital scenes also contribute to this idea.)One can continue drawing historical parallels. When the enraged Godzilla destroys Tokyo, Japan and leaves what remains of it aflame (all of which is awfully good fun), this resembles the WWII fire-bombing of the same city (again by the US). The fire-bombing of Tokyo in the film appears to be commenting on the horror of waging war against the civilians of an enemy country. Perhaps the electrified fence that the Japanese erect in order to electrocute Godzilla (haha, like that idea had a chance) symbolizes the critical US embargo of Japan in place before the attack on Pearl Harbor. (The Japanese perspective is that Pearl Harbor was attacked because the economic embargo was killing it economically. The fence-as-embargo idea makes sense if Godzilla now represents the Japanese breaking free of their confinement.)The cast is solid, with many regulars of Yasujirô Ozu's films aboard. There is a nice love triangle between Emiko (Momoko Kôchi), her beloved salvage officer Hideto (Akira Takarada) and the brilliant scientist Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), Emiko's arranged-fiancé who she will reject. Serizawa is an emotional center; he simultaneously loses at love, is the only person who figures out how to stop Godzilla and also introduces the guilt associated with introducing a new super-weapon to the world. (Years later, the original Star Trek coins the term, ""Doomsday Machine"".)Gojira is terrifying at first but as we observe first the accepted monster-expert Professor Tanabe (Fuyuki Murakami) and then Serizawa grappling with the guilt associated with its extermination, Godzilla becomes more sympathetic. Godzilla offers the film's greatest pleasures when it survives (and destroys) the electrified fence, survives repeated tank fire, survives machine gun fire and then retaliates by destroying no small number of obviously miniature trains, buildings and other structures that are supposed to be Tokyo. (Godzilla's vaporizing, death-ray vision is a very effective addition to an already formidable skill set, which includes the ability to destroy buildings with a single wag of his tail.) When fleeing humans appear in the same frame as the relentless, virtually inextinguishable beast, this is movie magic.Reviewers are split about Akira Ifukube's music; I like it. However, the most distinguishing characteristic of the production is the direction. Ishiro Honda's Black and White imagery ranges between somber and gloomy. Nearly every scene with humans feels claustrophobic and conveys the feeling of a suffocating weight holding everyone down. This is true even at the film's conclusion when Serizawa has removed the threat posed by Godzilla, as the characters are all hanging their heads and looking down at the sea.Godzilla is a superb monster movie that raises healthy moral concerns. Cinephiles should dash over to the revival theater that is showing it, dodging giant, lizard-like feet from above.",positive
"Well, this is the one that started it all. This is by far the most serious(and one of the best) of the Godzilla movies. Spoiler Alert: There will be spoilers ahead. A fishing ship mysteriously disappears, and then another one. Eventually, after several sightings, a giant, radioactive monster rises from Tokyo Bay and levels Tokyo. The monster is eventually killed by the Oxygen Destroyer, a weapon created by Dr. Serizawa. This movie succeeds in being entertaining and delivering a very serious message.The scenes where Godzilla is destroying Tokyo are very entertaining ( i couldn't take my eyes off of the screen) and very sad(at one point, there is a family in the wreckage of Tokyo, and the mother says something like""Hold on, children. We'll be with father soon.""). Plus, we've also got the whole 'love triangle' thing going on, but it ends very sadly, with Dr. Serizawa ( he loved Emiko, but she loved Ogata) killing himself when he kills Godzilla with the 'oxygen destroyer'. Overall, Uber thumbs-up. Sure, some of the dialog is cheesy, and some of the special effects are... interesting, but it was made in 1954. A true classic.",positive
"Gojira is a 1954 kaiju (giant monster) film produced by Toho studios, originally released in Japanese with English subtitles the film was re released in America with English dubbing and additional scenes. Directed by Ishirō Honda and starring Momoko Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata and Takashi Shimura the film follows the rampage of a giant radioactive lizard and the effects it has on the city of Tokyo. The film spawned a whopping 27 sequels spanning a 50 year period and remains one of the most iconic characters in Japanese culture.The film opens (as many Godzilla films do) with a small fishing boat being attacked whilst out at sea, after another ship is sunk mainland authorities and scientists soon flock to the small island of Odo to investigate. Amongst the investigators is Dr Yamane (Shimura) his daughter Emiko (Kochi) and her fiancé, and fellow scientist, Dr Serizawa (Hirata). Not long after the arrival of our protagonists, Odo island experiences a massive storm at which point Godzilla reveals himself to the characters and the viewer. After some quick research the official scientific opinion reached is that Godzilla is a giant lizard that has been mutated by nuclear radiation.Comparitively the folklore angle is that Japan is being punished by the Gods for meddling with nature and experimenting with nuclear bombs. Either way Godzilla makes a break straight for Tokyo and ,over the course of 2 nights, lays waste to the city (despite an ingenious pylon electric fence). Luckily Dr Serizawa has developed the deadly ""oxygen bomb"", an aquatic weapon designed to destroy the oxygen atoms in water and suffocate any nearby creatures. After seeing the destruction caused by the monster all three characters head out to sea to confront a submerged Godzilla and put an end to the destruction.A lot of people's impression of the Godzilla franchise is the inherent silliness of watching two men in rubber suits wrestle each other whilst smashing tiny buildings. The tone of the original film couldn't be further from that. A bleak and poignant allegory of nuclear technology, a mere 9 years after the events of the events of Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Godzilla is punishment for man inflicting suffering on his fellow man. A particularly sombre moment occurs when Dr Serizawa is refusing to use his oxygen destroyer for fear of more repercussions, however is convinced by seeing a news report on the television documenting Tokyo's devastation set to an eerie children's choir. When he uses the oxygen destroyer he insists that all knowledge be erased and Dr Yamane's final anti-nuclear monologue chills the viewer to the bone.The design of the monster is absolutely timeless. The look of the suit, the atomic breath and the iconic roar all contribute to the impact of the film and the franchise's longevity. The action sequences are as impressive now as I'm sure they were in 1954, sure you can see that the buildings and vehicles are miniatures but the grainy black and white style and epic classical score are more than enough to suspend your disbelief. The film also paces itself well and firmly establishes the moral of the story by the time Godzilla unleashes his fury on the city, which makes it all the more dramatic. As with most foreign films it is advisable to watch it subtitled to get the most engaging experience as dubbing only has the ability to make the film seem like a parody of the genre.I've only seen around a third of the 28 Godzilla films, and only in the last few years which makes me somewhat of novice with the franchise, but I started with the original and it's still one of the best of the series and of the 50s science fiction era. Whilst the other films can be a lot of fun none were able to deliver such a harrowing fable whilst simultaneously featuring a giant monster smashing up the landscape. Most of the Godzilla films have never gotten a DVD release in the UK but this one has, so go check it out and see where the legend began.5 Stars ***** How many Godzilla films have you seen?

"Ever since King Kong was shot down from the top of the Empire State Building in 1933, giant monsters have become a staying addition amongst the movie monsters. Though I consider myself as a very big fan and admirer of horror movies, my preference is usually the more classic sort like vampires and mad scientists. The ""huge monsters attack and destroy cities"" is not truly my thing. That said, there are still some movies of this genre that I adore. The already said original King Kong is a definite classic, but it is the 1954 original Gojira, commonly Godzilla, that is closest to my heart. The opening of the film alone is memorable. Just the bold title ""Gojira"" on the screen, with the sound of the famous roar in the background. Cut to a peaceful shipping boat on a sunny day, that is suddenly attacked and destroyed by something mysterious. More ships follow the same path, and government of Japan is facing a crisis. Meantime, on a nearby island all the fishes seem to have disappeared from the sea. Old superstitious people tell it is Gojira, legendary monster from their myths. The said island is soon attacked by a huge dinosaur like monster that breathes fire and is radioactive. It's an unseen creature from pre-historic era, awakened and mutated by atomic bombs, and it's heading towards Tokyo. Unlike its 30 or so sequels, the original Gojira was never meant as cheap entertainment movie. There are no aliens, super vehicles or other monsters fighting Godzilla here. This film was meant as a very direct objection against nuclear tests and wars in general, warning men that nothing good will come out of them. The shots of destroyed Tokyo, injured people being treated and the girl chore singing in the background, must have had a pretty strong effect on Japanese people, who were still recovering from the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The black and white cinematography gives a nightmarish, almost apocalyptic feeling, and it helps hiding some of the out-dated special effects. Thanks to it most of the miniatures and Godzilla's rubber suit do not bother in the film. Also worth mentioning is the music score, one of the greatest I've heard, and that was still used as Godzilla's theme music in many of the later films. The final scene, where Godzilla gives his dying roar before sinking to the depths of the ocean, is strangely melancholic and sad. Godzilla itself still deserves the title ""king of the monsters"". A gigantic fire breathing mutant dinosaur that destroys everything from its way, like a force of nature, is astonishing to say the least. Not to mention that unlike King Kong, army can't do anything to this guy. Godzilla is shot with tanks, missiles, airplanes, high-voltage electricity fences and what else, nothing works. In the end it is brilliant Dr. Serizawa's kamikaze-attack with his life work that stops the monster. The original Japanese ""Gojira""(1954) remains as one of the best monster movies of all time, as well as a great anti-war film.",positive
"This is the one. The truly best version of the Godzilla story. Now available on DVD in a special box set, a must for all Godzilla fans and a treat for those who have never seen the original or only have the truncated American version to go by. Not to take away from the Raymond Burr version,(which, by the way is still great entertainment)but this version brings the dark and scary story full on...and you will find yourself almost believing a monster created by atomic testing.I highly recommend this, because not only have I been a ""G"" fan for forever...but for many years this version was out of the public eye and available primarily as a bootleg with subtitles, in some cases, very badly scratched in. Now this scary masterpiece can be viewed in a well restored print but with a re-mixed score and bonus material.",positive
"It's hard to believe it's now been more than six decades since Godzilla was first unleashed upon the world. First released in 1954, Godzilla became the film that both launched a genre and became the benchmark by which it would be judged by. It's a film that, even after all the years that have passed since, continues to resonate with a sense of being a rare film that is at once of its time and yet is timeless as well.The film is best remembered for introducing Godzilla to cinema screens. In an interesting move, the film spends quite a bit of time before revealing the titular beast, a move that pre-echoes what Spielberg would do with Jaws two decades later. It's something that, even with the iconic nature of Godzilla, is still immensely effective today in building both tension and audience expectations. The first appearance comes as a genuine surprise after quite a bit of build-up and subsequent appearances are quite sparse when one realizes that the film runs less than 100 minutes. It's an interesting way of treating the soon to be iconic monster to be sure.The film is also remembered for its, at the time, impressive special effects. Watching the film today, the special effects have of course dated. Godzilla is clearly a man in a suit and the miniature effects are unlikely to convince anyone though are impressive pieces of work for their time. The effects though do what they set out to do: they present a series of images for the viewer's imagination to latch onto. The images, the effect of the effects as it were, create a series of indelible images which have become iconic. More importantly they serve the story which makes it possible to overlook some of their deficiencies. Because, as important and iconic as though effects are, they aren't what really matters. Godzilla, though it shares its name with the rampaging monster, is a film about science run amok and its consequences. The film shows us the aftermath of each of Godzilla's appearances from families worried about missing crew members of lost ships to a devastated Tokyo and of course the final scene. It's a film that is of its time in a way, coming in the aftermath of massive American conventional bombing as well as the dropping of two atomic bombs at the end of the Second World War, as the filmmakers use so much of its iconography and the fear of early Cold War nuclear testing to create their world. The results give the film a sense of time, place, and indeed emotional power that so many other films of the genre it spawned would lack. It's also something that, for all the looking down that is done on Godzilla and the films it spawned, helps make it a surprisingly intelligent film. The writing and plotting of Godzilla is comparable to Nigel Kneale's Quatermass serials being made by the BBC on the other side of the world during the same decade. While I sincerely doubt any obvious connection between the two, they're both quite similar in terms of taking real world fears and exploring them in a science fiction context. The basic idea of Godzilla, that is of an ancient force coming back to wreck terror on the modern world in part thanks to our technological development, is very much in keeping with Kneale's writing. That there's a scientist trying to understand the threat while butting heads with the establishment also reminds one of Kneale's Quatermass serials as well. While these are perhaps elements present in so much of 1950s science fiction worldwide, rarely are they as thoughtfully examined or portrayed as this film presented it.Yet for all of its sense of being of its time, it's all a timeless piece. The central premise of the past coming back to haunt us never gets old and the potential dangers of nuclear energy has continued to be highlighted over the years from nuclear accidents (including the meltdown at Chernobyl and more recently at Fukushima in Japan) along with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The debate over how to deal with Godzilla, whether the use of one terrible weapon to stop a threat is justified, speaks not just to the arms race of the Cold War but to modern concerns about the nature of drone warfare and mass surveillance with the question of 'do the ends justify the means?'. All of this has helped to make the original 1954 Godzilla film as watchable today as it was then. It's combination of tense pacing, effects, and thoughtful storytelling make it a film that continues to be unique despite numerous sequels and remakes. It's a thoughtful, well made piece of science fiction and one that I suspect will continue to be watched for decades to come.",positive
"I can see why the first and original Godzilla movie started a hit mega-franchise that has spawned so many great monsters in film. In Japan, the film is ""Gojira"", a dark and somber storyline symbolizing what the Japanese felt during the ends of WWII. The movie is way past its time creating visual effects that seem parallel to modern day filmmaking. No, there isn't a ton of action but the animations seemed realistic and far from the cheesiness of future Godzilla movies. The plot and characters were also very humanizing compared to many monster films during this decade. It's clear that Ishiro Honda hit a home run with this terrifying and classic monster movie Gojira!",positive
"This original 1954 version was not released in the USA until its 50th anniversary in 2004. Yes, the special effects are crude and dated, but this dark and poignant film expresses the Japanese view of nuclear war, nine years after World War Two ended.",positive
"I saw this movie two years ago in Cambridge Mass. There was only 1 empty seat, and all watching it were attentive. I don't think I ever saw a group of people more interested in a film! I ""grew up"" never knowing a masterpiece ever existed. Many thanks to Rialto for the theatrical version, and a special ""thank you"" to Classic Mediaa for the release on DVD. My copy will come in Sptember. The film is well acted, well directed, wonderful music, and a most important message. Never knowing that it would be released, I did obtain a European version, but to have the movie all ""filtered""is important. I always thought the ""butchered"" version made no sense, and there was no plot. that made any sense. To this day, I always hated the American version, and always will! You are in for a well deserved treat in buying this film on DVD; I have mine coming when it is released. A question! Can anyone reading this please translate the ""Prayer for peace"" There are no subtitles as the young are singing. A superb movie! Lastly, the American version has Momoko Kochi telling some of the plot (or a translator) Did she speak English? She played Emiko An A++ Movie",positive
"Godzilla, was a movie, that even my grandfather enjoyed. Until now, Godzilla films begin to stun us with amazing stories and effects.But this, out of 28 Japanese Godzilla films, is my favorite. Good story to put up a radioactive monster. This is, for me, the best monster movie of the 1950's. The acting of the Japanese-well, It'll do good. After this movie is Godzilla Raids Again, which is a great film, but then again, not better than this original. ""The Original Japanese Masterpiece"". It might be a 50-year old movie, but I think there has been no good giant monster films lately, and this movie is still being remembered in us. And Professor Yamane also explains here how Godzilla came to be. There might be a few laughs on the faces of the actors, but that doesn't mean this movie isn't good anymore. I strongly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan.This is a long movie, but at least I enjoyed it. And the music of the film was great, and I enjoyed the roar of the original Godzilla, too. Over all, I'll give this movie a 10/10. A must watch.",positive
"Inarguably, one of the most influential giant monsters films out there, as much for the incredibly destructive nature of the film and iconic monster design as for its social and political commentary towards nuclear bombs and their ecological impact on mankind.",positive
"Growing up Godzilla was the ultimate King of monsters to me. I remember my dad recording the Goadzilla dubbed colour movies which were on really late at night and I used to come down entuastically watching Godzilla and his friends tear down Tokyo or save the humans from an outer space monster or aliens. I never did see the original 1954 version but last Saturday , they were giving away a free copy within the Guardian Newspaper so I thought to my-self -YESSSS ! I finally got round to paying my homage last night to it and its easy to understand why the Big G is the King of the Monster and why the American remake although entertaining is just plain inferior compared to this. Okay the story builds people up to it and we are anxious for the mayhem to begin , the affects may seem very dated but it is all part of the magic that made Godzilla so special for all of us. The performance are all brilliant and really give us that sci-fi feel to it which paved the way for future nerds in monster movies. Although the film might drag in place a little to long and might also have an unwanted romance plot , the real star of the show is Godzilla , any movie goer should pay homage to this and understand that this was the movie that paved the way for future movies.GODZILLA 8.1 OUT OF 10THE LEGEND BEGINS...",positive
"Gojira -- a jumbo fire-breathing monster -- is set loose by an atomic bomb and does a terrifying number on Tokyo before being driven off by Mitsubishi Zeros, I mean American-built F-86 Sabres. A scientist has the device that will destroy the monster but is reluctant to use it because the device could be weaponized. He uses it anyway, at the willing cost of his own life.I kept trying to compare this original Japanese version with the export version made for the American market, the one with a somber Raymond Burr describing the destruction. It wasn't easy because I hadn't seen the Burr version for years.The isomorph we've been exposed to is almost funny. Burr is wide-eyed and awed. The monster is a man in a ridiculous rubber suit. The visual effects are based on models and give away their true size because of their texture. A rocket hitting Tokyo Bay sends up splashes with drops as big as basketballs.Yet, though the skeleton of the story and its associated effects are the same, this is a far more serious story. There's nothing much laughable about it. There are extended scenes of the suffering of Tokyo's residents after the raid by Gojira. The hospitals are jammed. Babies wail. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out what memories, only nine years old, were being redintegrated in the collective consciousness of the Japanese viewers. (Kids, we dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese cities, three days apart, at the end of World War II. PS: That would be 1945.) The movie is deliberately invested with moral weight. The scientist who destroys Gojira kills himself so that the secret of his device will never be revealed and used in war. He's already destroyed his notes, but the knowledge is inside his head.That spirit of self sacrifice is built into Japanese culture and I have no idea whether it's easy or not for most Westerners to grasp that and other subtleties. It's a matter of national character. And not just something as simple as young ladies hiding their giggles behind their hands. When the scientist tells his assistant never to reveal the existence of the secret oxygen destroyer, she promises. Later, when she breaks her promise, she and the man to whom she revealed the secret hang their heads in shame before the scientist and beg his forgiveness. The device may save the world, but they're still ashamed because they've broken a moral code. When I was in the service, a colleague told me wonderingly about his leaving a Japanese cat house and being chased down the street by one of the staff who wanted to return the wallet he'd left behind.Well -- so much for cultural relativity. In case we might overlook the fact that this story is really about something other than a destructive monster who is a man in a rubber suit, one of the scientists launches into an obiter dictum about how much he hopes no more nuclear bombs will be exploded so they can avoid more Gojiras.It's a sobering movie.",positive
"Godzilla 1954 is just an amazing film and it's what started the kaiju genre! As being a die-hard Godzilla fan I would say this is probably my favorite movie of all time. If not, it is definitely in my top 10. This film, directed by Ishiro Honda is everything a classic monster film needs; darkness, depression, destruction, fear, iconic roar and last but not least, great character development! I absolutely love this film! There is no other giant monster flick that could beat it. This film is actually pretty scary (especially for its time). When you see Godzilla destroying building and people lying half dead on the street crying for help it is actually pretty haunting. Especially his roar! Godzilla's roar in this is very haunting and scary. Godzilla is a big metaphor for nuclear destruction and man's arrogance. Anyway, this movie is AWESOME and I think everyone has to check it out. A MUST WATCH!",positive
"Japan is thrown into a panic after several ships are sunk. The authorities think its either underwater mines or volcanic activity, so they head to Odo Island, close to where several of the ships were sunk. Something comes onshore and destroys several houses and kills several people. A later expedition to the island soon discovers something more devastating than imagined in the form of a colossus monster whom the natives call Gojira. Now, the monster begins a rampage that threatens to destroy not only Japan but the rest of the world as well.......Having grown up with seeing the Godzilla Vs. ............., movies, the silly cartoon featuring Godzooky, the Raymond Burr one from 1985, and Ultimately Godzilla 98', the connotations about Nuclear weapons and chemical warfare being bad were getting across to me.So after seeing the 2014 version, I wanted to seek the film that started it all, the film that garnered such a cult following, and again, being spoiled with the effects laden, character driven movie Edwards has just given us, the movie was a little disappointing for me.It's still a wonderful feat, back in 1954, this must have been groundbreaking stuff, the effects and the titular creature are wonderful, but the acting is a little chucklesome.I know I shouldn't have let the new movie influence my thoughts on this, but hey, I'm only human.Its a dark film, much more serious in tone than other movies in the genre, and the fact that Godzilla is a metaphor for the aftermath of a Nuclear war is rife, so all in all, its a very good film, just don't watch the new one before this.",positive
"This is what a giant monster movie should be like: no sympathy, no questions answered, no reason, no rhyme. Gojira comes, he sees, and dies by that which created him. A great and tested formula. Having seen both the Japanese and American versions I can tell you one thing, if you need more explanation as you're watching, go with the American version. The inclusion of Raymond Burr will help you immerse yourself in what is a contrast to the dropping of the A-Bomb. I scored it a 10 because you wont have a dull moment, even for those not into Sci Fi. The acting is top notch, Gojira is well done, and you'll enjoy from beginning to end.",positive
"This is easily the best of the Godzilla series, the most masterfully plotted and executed, and one of the only ones where the Big Guy ends up looking ridiculous instead of fearsome.  The original Japanese cut is definitely the way to go if you really want to see the way the movie was meant to be.  A lot of scenes not present in the American version help connect and deepen the characters, and original dialogue is always preferable to dubbing. However, surprisingly, the Americanized Godzilla, King of the Monsters stands it's ground as well.  While not quite as powerful as the original on the point of nuclear allegory, Raymond Burr is, unlike in Godzilla 1985, edited convincingly into the film.  Terry Morse actually took some time to think up ways to incorporate Burr, and so this version, thankfully, is not a total disaster.  Even if you aren't really a huge fan of Japanese monster flicks, rent this or watch it on TV if it's on; if you are, you must watch this movie.",positive
"As I started to watch Godzilla, I thought it was going to be a film overflowing with Special effects, and lack a complex story. I could not have been more wrong, it is more the other way around. There is a great build-up to seeing Godzilla, but around 30 minutes in, when you finally see him, it is both frightening and spectacular. He then disappears back into the ocean, for another 30 minutes. It is here the film gets much more intelligent, with political conversations, and mass panic. Then Godzilla strikes Tokyo. This scene shows the power of Godzilla, as he destroys everything. It is a much Darker film than you may expect, and completely different to later Showa era Godzilla films. The way the manage to destroy Godzilla, did seem to be a little ham fisted, it was a very contrived way to kill Godzilla. Finally, the film does not really centre around a handful of characters (though there are some recurring characters) rather the overall effect Godzilla has made to Japan. You should probably watch this before you watch Godzilla 2014, and do not bother with Godzilla 1998.",positive
"The film is no doubt dated. We know its a man in a suit, we know he's destroying miniatures and we know how implausible all this is. But if you can put all that aside you will find a great film with some good things to say.The performances in this film hold up for the most part. The scene stealer(aside from Godzilla) is Akihiko Hirata. Whose character you could almost swear is based on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the original atomic bomb. His portrayal of such a tortured soul is very believable and definitely leaves an impression. Ishiro Honda's direction of this film is great as well. Now onto the star of this movie. Godzilla in this film is not a cute green lizard that is friend to children and defender of the planet earth. He is a force of nature. Just as unstoppable and just as unforgiving. If the rain falls on the just and unjust, then Godzilla is that rain. Scenes in this film the depict the effects of his rampage do not depict them the way a film like The Avengers or Man of Steel would. Scenes that show people being crushed under rubble or people in emergency medical centers give this film a dark and almost realistic tone. The way officials react to the devastation feels like the way they would really react to a catastrophe like the world has never seen before.Akira Ifukube's score is great as well and not just of all the scenes where Godzilla is wrecking buildings and melting down metal with his atomic breath. But its great in the quiet moments as well. The music that plays during climax of the film is a very somber and beautiful piece.This film was released in 1954, only nine years after the atomic bomb devastated Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Some have said that Godzilla was Japan's way of coping with what had happened to them. The films anti- nuclear weapons message isn't very subtle, but it is told well. Overall this is a great film that should not just be judged by its cover or name. With a strong message about the consequences that can be brought on by mankind's need to destroy each other. Now let's hope the remake coming soon follows in this one's footsteps well.",positive
"""Gojira"" or ""Godzilla"" is more or less a joke by now. The 'character', not the film. Those who have actually seen this original Japanese version of the film are minimal in number when compared to those who have seen the much weaker 1956 Americanized version with Raymond Burr, which besides featuring the rather lame and unnecessary scenes with Mr. Burr, in addition to annoying narration, cuts a massive chunk of scenes from the film, rendering it a passable, but really just mediocre and typical monster movie. ""Gojira"" is much more.The typical comparison will of course be with ""King Kong"", and while my personal preference lies with the giant ape's original 1933 adventure, there is no denying that ""Gojira"" takes far more care in developing its characters, plot, setting, and ideas than King Kong does. This film is well thought-out with sympathetic characters, an interesting sci-fi plot, non-preachy social and political commentary, and some actual drama and nice surprise moments.That's not to say this film isn't problematic at all, because it is a bit rough around the edges and its special effects aren't honestly much more impressive than monster films made a good 10-20 years before it. That said, the film is surprisingly well-directed by Ishiro Honda, king of the Kaiju films. The use of music adds to the atmosphere as does the surprisingly effective acting.""Gojira"" may be flawed, but it stands the test of time as a fine film in general and a very entertaining monster movie. I'm of the minority opinion that it may not be truly the best Godzilla movie, as I'm partial to some of the later ones made through the 80's and 90's, but it's just about the only one that is an engaging and entertaining drama as well as a dumb monster movie.8/10",negative
"Nothing beats seeing an icon in prototype form, right? That's the feeling I thought I would get, and did for a good lot of the time, in watching Ishiro Honda's original version of 1954's Godzilla. It's also a 'prototype' (almost an experiment to see if a big monster movie could work) that shows both credibility as an allegorical entertainment and as a goofy horror movie. I haven't seen the American version, King of the Monsters, in quite a number of years so it's hard for me to compare, but on a first viewing of the Japanese version I was pleased on a level that is, in it's own right, comparable to when I re-watched the original King Kong recently. There shouldn't be that much to the story, and when one looks deep enough there isn't really (though I could argue that Godzilla has a little more human depth with the main love triangle and the resentment at the methods used by the government against Godzilla by Takashi Shimura' Yamane), but there is enough to keep just the right spot of interest alongside the 'message' built into the framework of the picture.For one thing, even looking on it now from 2006, it's still got some things to marvel at technically. For the first time Japanese filmmakers used the kinds of storyboards used by Disney and his people for animated films to construct the main centerpiece of Godzilla's attack of Tokyo. And like looking back on Elvis's swinging hips in America in the 1950s, what could (and probably is) dated still doesn't lose it's appeal as a kind of extravagant, unique export. It's not that this Godzilla- err, Gojira- is very convincing; matter of fact it's almost like watching kids playing with toys only blown up to scale. But I have rarely seen such a display of 'kids playing toys' type special effects done to such great an effect. I ended up believing much more in the Godzilla made of rubber and with totally unmovable, plastic eyes and facial expressions, than I did in the overly computer-designed Godzilla of the 1998 remake, or even of the sequels that followed this. What ends up happening in this big Tokyo attack, no doubt, is pretty silly at times, with a laugh-out-loud moment from seeing the reporters still on the roof of the broadcast building always reporting live even up until Godzilla comes up, to which the broadcaster says ""Ok, Goodbye, everyone, Goodbye."" But the film-making behind it is always of a professional caliber via Honda and special effects team led by the master Eiji Tsuburya, who became a legend in his own right with how he created Godzilla and designed the attacks on the cities and destruction.Then behind the monster and the action-film technical side is the story, and there is at least some good effort put into making it convincing, if only on the simplest of levels. But this simplicity is amplified when looking back on the period, of the utmost paranoia and fear about what could happen not only if another atomic explosion happened, but from what ALREADY happened via 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man'. It's explicitly cautionary, to be sure, as Shimura's last lines indicate in a not too subtle way (""we need to stop the radiation, or another Godzilla will come""), but one does care about the characters presented, and how representative they are put up as being of 'the types' in Japan. Shimura, who filmed this around the same time as Seven Samurai, is always in fine form, sometimes with the same sullen, horrified-by-the-humanity-of-it-all look he had in Ikiru, as the one man who wants to study the monster, not destroy it. Then there's the love triangle set up between Emiko (Kochi), Serizawa (Hirata), and Hideo (Takarada). It's set up actually in a subtle way, and never quite gets payed off, but there ends up being at least a couple of great scenes showing Serizawa (with Hirata wonderfully decked out in an eye-patch and an always sincerely serious look) in complete doubt about using his Oxygyn Disintegration machine to destroy Godzilla. While it doesn't help that Kochi is not that good of an actress (straddling that unfortunate line between laughing, smiling and crying), there's always a good tension set-up in these moments with the actors, particularly when Emiko has to keep a certain promise to Serizawa. Meanwhile, Tokyo's about to go up in flames! Luckily, it's social message does have some strength to it, particularly by an ending that I found credible all the more so because the filmmakers didn't try to top what had already happened in the Tokyo destruction at night (and hard to top that in one movie anyway) but took a sort of somber approach in those last underwater scenes. It might've been blunt, but those were blunt times as well. Not that this doesn't mean the picture doesn't have it's idiotic points, as in every Godzilla movie they could be found (some of the cuts with Godzilla being seen and coming out of the water are awkward and stilted, and one's tempted to laugh at the suit on first sight), yet like Night of the Living Dead it's notions of making a statement also comes intact with the knowledge that the movie's there to really 'move' and be a crowd-pleaser/shocker as the first of its kind. It might even have been some kind of weird landmark if it were the only one produced; as it stands it still marks a highpoint in the careers of Honda and Tsuburaya, as well as a great ""popcorn"" film for Toho studios.

"Synopsis: Well I don't know where to start, I should probably written this in 1954 but I was not born yet so. And I think it is better to write reviews after you have watched many many movies before. This is the mother of all monster movies, I guess that the majority of movie fans have seen this so the review is more like a fan review from my side. And it is for the audience that have seen it and want to rate the review I make or by those who want to become a big movie fan. This is where the Kaiju genre started and in English it is giant monster. It starts with a roar from the monster of all monsters and if you listen closely you will recognize this sound from Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg's T-Rex. The sound is taken from him. The movie itself is about Gojira (Godzilla) and it is one of the best out there. And if you think about what year this came out you understand what an amazing movie this was in 1954 when it came to theaters in Asia or mainly Japan. It is a mystery what all this is about from the beginning. A ship gets attacked by something and one of the survivors say it looked like the sea exploded. Hilarious quote by the way. They start to research this mysterious thing after some boats are getting attacked. They soon find out it is a sea monster from the Jura era. When the dinosaurs lived. They think it is woken up by atomic radiation. I will come to that in my summary of this review because it has a lot to do with the morale in this movie. You guessed right it is Godzilla that comes up from that sea and make the best movie monster of all time. Acting: Well what should we say here the acting of Godzilla or the actors. The monster part is excellent enough said. But the actors I can say something about. He actually played in a lot of these Toho movies with monsters, like King Kong Escapes (1967), Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965), Mothra vs Godzilla (1964), Godzilla King of the Monsters. He did a good job in this movie actually and that is why he appears in other movies outside of this I guess. Momoko Kochi also became a little Toho icon after this movie. Half Human (1955), she also appears in Godzilla King of the Monsters, The Mysterians (1957), Godzilla vs. Destroyah. Did a good job in this movie, nothing very big to mention but still good. Takashi Shimura the biggest actor of them all in this movie. He acted in over 200 movies and some were very big titles from Japan. This guy plays in so many big movies from Japan it would be to much to mention my favorites but to name some of the big ones, it would be the Akira Kurosawa movies he played in many of the samurai movies from him and also played in 4 of the well known Kaiju movies from Toho. He is always a good watch and did a good job in this one. Last of them I wanted to talk about is Akihiko Hirata also represented in other Godzilla movies. And one of my favorite monsters. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974), Terror of Mechgodzilla (1975), also a little heads up he was in Ultraman: Monster big Battle (1976). He also did a great job here. Cinematography: Well the setting is in Japan and some places in Tokyo mostly in the studio in Tokyo. And it is really great. Very good use of the camera angles by far from this era in the 50's. Sound/Music: I already did say something about this but the sound of this monster is the best in history. It shivers down your spine and Jurassic Park made its own version of this sound. Try to compare them. The music is known even today by the movie industry. And will be there for all time. Costumes/Make-up: The only thing to mention here is the Godzilla costume and it is absolutely amazing for its time. The way his body moves and the way his mouth moves at times is very good. Summary: The director Ishiro Honda is one favorite to remember for all time. The man who created the monster genre like we know it today. I can't write up all of the movies I like about him but look him up on IMDb. I would recommend this to all but I can't promise that all will like it. If you like monster movies check out all the Toho movies like Gamera, Mothra, Ultraman, and Godzilla movie. You have many other monster movies by them to if you really like them. Some of them are really hard to come by but search on ebay and maybe you get lucky. But this movie is a masterpiece and everybody who love movies should watch this one time. And hopefully you get your mind in the direction to check out all of the Toho movies. I will review all of the Gamera and Godzilla movies very soon as I see them and take notes. So if you want more reviews keep up to date about my reviews. I am thinking of making video reviews on my youtube channel to if someone want to see my collection and have more fun with watching then reading reviews. As I was talking about earlier this movies morale is actually a bit of a propaganda movie. They still had a big grudge on the US for the Hiroshima bombing. And this goes on in this movie, I will not spoil anything big but have this in mind when watching it.",positive
"Now I'll talk about Gojira, the Japanese uncut version of Godzilla: King of Monsters which is still pretty good after all these years. It's mostly an allegory against nuclear war and Godzilla is a symbol of what might happen out of nuclear fallout. It takes place in 1954 less than a decade after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A boat goes missing and when the search leads up to Godzilla and it's amazing to see and hear Godzilla's roar for the first time.All the Japanese treat this disaster like a real event as well and all the people dying the hospital when he attacks the city are disturbing. Godzilla also looks scary in black and white and it really makes the mood sad. Also when you get the part about the oxygen destroyer, you'll be shocked. This movie also made it in the criterion collection as well and has gotten the Blu-ray treatment too. Give this start of the giant monster movies, or kaiju movies, a watch when you can.",positive
"When I was a little kid, I remember renting the Americanized version ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" at a Blockbuster. The American version was really cool. However, because I was only 8, it made me wonder. All the Japanese actor's voices were out of sync with the mouth movements. and some of the actors didn't sound all that Japanese. It was'nt until I went online to tohokingdom.com when I discovered that this movie is not American: it is a re-edit of a flick that was made in Japan in 1954. On Saturday, September 9, 2006, I went to Best Buy and got the original Japanese version on DVD. It was AWESOME! ¡EXELANTE! ¡MUY BIEN! I noticed a lot of scenes that were taken out such as the beginning scene when Ogata talks on the phone in his office and the scenes showing workers talking to families of survivors, and especially the scene showing the power station people preparing to electrocute Gojira. Those who haven't seen the original:In the original version, when Emiko tells Ogata she could'nt tell Serizawa about their affair, when he tugs her arm, originally, he did'nt say anything. Just made made an angry look.",positive
"I'd seen the naff but watchable 1998 Roland Emmerich version, and the fairly good 2014 Gareth Edwards version, but I'd never seen the original Japanese film featuring the pop culture icon known as ""King of the Monsters"". This 1954 classic is the one that started it all, I found it through the BFI, and I was looking forward to watching it. Basically in Japan, a number of freighters and ships are destroyed in mysterious circumstances, with few survivors, and fishing catches are reduced to zero, these incidents are blamed on an ancient sea creature known as ""Godzilla"". Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate, that night a large storm strikes, and an unseen force destroys many homes, and kills nine people and twenty villagers' livestock. Odo residents travel to Tokyo demanding disaster relief, villagers and reporters have evidence that something large is crushing the village, palaeontologist Kyohei Yamane (Ikiru's Takashi Shimura) is sent by the government to lead the investigation to the island. Giant radioactive footprints and a trilobite (extinct creature fossils) are discovered, and soon enough the creature Godzilla appears, it is a gigantic dinosaur that crashes around and roars, before returning to the sea. Yamane estimates Godzilla to be 50 metres (164 ft) tall, evolved from an ancient sea creature becoming a terrestrial animal, and came from deep underwater, it was disturbed by underwater hydrogen bomb testing. Yamane wants to study Godzilla, but ten frigates are dispatched in an attempt to kill the monster, this fails, Yamane says Godzilla is unkillable, having survived H-bomb testing. The monster next appears in Tokyo Bay and enters the city, destroying everything in its path with its large feet, body and atomic breath, before once again returning to the ocean. While the Japanese Self-Defense Forces construct a 30 metres (98 ft) tall, 50,000 volt electrified fence along the coast, Yamane is devastated there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation, the creature resurfaces in Tokyo, unleashing a more destructive rampage across the city, with increased loss of life. Yamane's colleague, Daisuke Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), who was engaged to Yamane's daughter, Emiko (Momoko Kôchi), has researched and developed a weapon called the ""Oxygen Destroyer"", which disintegrates oxygen atoms and the organisms die of a rotting asphyxiation, Serizawa eventually agrees to use the weapon in an attempt to destroy Godzilla, having seen the devastation. Salvage ship captain Hideto Ogata (Akira Takarada), who Emiko now loves, and Serizawa take a navy ship out of Tokyo Bay to plant a device, they find Godzilla using its radiation as detection, Serizawa sacrifices his life to activate the Oxygen Destroyer, the mission proves t be successful, Godzilla is destroyed, many mourn the death of Serizawa, and Yamane believes if nuclear weapons testing continues, another Godzilla may rise in the future. Also starring Sachio Sakai as Newspaper Reporter Hagiwara, Fuyuki Murakami as Professor Tanabe and Ren Yamamoto as Masaji Sieji. It obviously looks dated by today's standards, including the special effects, with cardboard style buildings being destroyed, a man in a dinosaur suit stomping around, and the creature's atomic breath, but that is part of the charm, unlike the many sequels and the American remakes, and there are moments that genuinely grip you, I can imagine it would have been pretty scary in the day, a great old-fashioned science-fiction horror monster movie. Good!",negative
"More than straight monster-movie fare, Gojira offers potent, sobering postwar commentary.(1954) When a Japanese steamer sinks in flames after the sea seems to erupt, survivors talk of a legendary monster...Godzilla! The picture that started it all .
There is no topping the original. The original Godzilla is a perfect monster movie. It is a simple story that channels a country's fear of atomic destruction in the form of a giant monster. Every scene of destruction carries with it a weight. In later films, when Godzilla comes rumbling through a city, it's presented as a loving, fun way of showing the monsters have come to town. Here, it's a solemn affair, full of dread and tension. People die, and their deaths are felt.",positive
"For a long time I watched the Raymond Burr version, and I thought it was rather overrated. But in 2008, when I checked this out at my library, I was blown away at the Japanese version.The story, the characters, the effects, everything is amazing about this movie. This has got the best Godzilla movie of all time, if not one of the best movies of all time period.And the fact that the effects were made in 1954, and some of them still hold up today is amazing. The acting is amazing as well. This movie makes me want to see the new one so bad. I hope Gareth Edwards stays true to this movie.That's all I have to say.",positive
"With the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still fresh in the minds of Japanese society, the original Godzilla film was designed to be an allegory for nuclear destruction. Godzilla himself is a product of nuclear testing, a prehistoric monster that was mutated by the radiation of bomb tests and goes on a rampage throughout Tokyo. This movie presents Godzilla as a destructive force of nature, a violent beast that destroys everything in its path. Despite being merely an actor in a rubber suit, Godzilla looks very good, particularly for the time it was filmed. Obviously, the highlight of the film is the all the scenes with Godzilla, but the human characters here are sympathetic and interesting, particularly the tormented Dr. Serizawa, creator of the one thing that could potentially defeat Godzilla. The film is dark and eerie in tone, and it carries a very heavy message with it. Overall, it's an entertaining and thought-provoking monster movie and despite it's slow pace, it's still everything you could want from it. It is definitely a classic, and of course it introduced the world to Godzilla, the real King of the Monsters.",positive
"This isn't just Godzilla. It is Godzilla: Uncut! Uncensored! Undubbed! Unparalleled! Rialto restored it from the American version, which cut 1/3 of the original to make this what they wanted: a cheap monster flick put in theaters to make a few bucks.  So you can imagine my surprise when I saw the actual film. Sure, I'd seen the 1998 version featuring shallow character actors who somehow manage to single-handedly destroy The King of the Monsters! Sure, my father had seen the Raymond Burr version years back as part of a double feature matinee. But what I found in Godzilla was a movie which took its time, allowed tension to build and reputations to be deserved, and unfortunately lulled the two men next me into occasional sleeping fits. But that can be excused, because you've never seen a monster movie quite like this one. Godzilla haunts the streets of Japan. Well, he rampages and shoots some sort of steam out of his mouth that sets whole buildings on fire, but I've never seen a 150-foot lizard rampage so quietly and eloquently, or come so late into the movie. Perhaps what you will take away most from this movie is the insight into Japan, which was recovering from the World War II bombings. They simultaneously parody the new `science as warfare' phenomena (a scientist with an eye patch invents a weapon called The Oxygen Destroyer!), and show us that if they had that kind of power, they would make it an honorable opportunity, a sort of kamikaze attack on evil. Godzilla, though rubber, is an evil awaken from his rocky slumber underwater and has become extremely radioactive. He hungrily comes onto land to teach man a thing or two. You don't sympathize with this monster as much as, say, King Kong, but there's a pervasive sense of apprehension behind this whole film. This Godzilla has a quiet, almost elegiac ending, and the last underwater sequence is a marvel in which all of the themes of the movie come full circle.
My grade: 8/10",positive
"Gojira (the version minus Perry Mason a.k.a. Raymond Burr), is by far superior to both its American Release version and the other Godzilla knock-offs that followed.   In the American Release, the story is reduced to little more than a narrative by Raymond Burr, with most of the dialogue either badly dubbed, or completely cut out of the film all together. However, in the original release, you get a better feel of the story and the characters, as well as a better sense of the movies message on the evils of atomic power, and the consequences of tampering with nature.In the original version, you also get a much better sense of Dr. Serizawa's frustration and the dilemma he must face in giving the world the weapon that he had invented that could defeat Gojira (a dilemma that was probably shared by the scientists that helped develop the atomic bomb).Robot Ranchers rating: 8 out of 10.   Gojira is by far darker, and not as much fun as the later Godzilla movies featuring Jet Jaguar and the pantheon of other crazy giant creatures, but it is a much stronger film and shares little with the kiddie orientated nature of the other films that followed in the genera that it created.",positive
"Surprisingly a very good movie and for it's time pretty scary. The opening music is highly atmospheric and creepy, plus makes you wonder what-the-hell has happened exactly, to brilliant film scores over the last 20 years. Legendary stuff from 'The Land of the Rising Sun'. A true block buster of its day and still a real social comment of the post Hiroshima, nuclear age. Dark, serious, though the duration is a bit too long.",positive
"If you want to know how I feel about most Godzilla movies, try reading my review of King Kong Versus Godzilla. Saying I HATE THEM would be very charitable to say the least! However, because of the intensity of my hatred of this genre, I must in good conscience say that the original Godzilla flick is pretty good. At this point, the franchise had not yet been ruined by pointless repetition and the crappy special effects were just fine for the 1950s. However, even in the most recent incarnations, the special effects have NOT improved. What was acceptable in the 1950s is unforgivable going into the 21st century! So, going back to the original. The Japanese decided to intersperse some new material integrating Raymond Burr into the flick to make it more understandable and more palatable to Western audiences. This was a good decision, though a few of the Burr scenes do look VERY much like an afterthought. This was parodied hilariously in a Pinky and the Brain episode where every few minutes, the exact same scene with Raymond Burr is spliced into it--""yes,...yes,...I see"" was repeated each time! Despite this, it is still original, interesting and worth a look. However, DON'T assume that this gets better with repetition. Not every movie deserves a sequel!!PLEASE NOTE: Do not confuse this review of the American version of Godzilla with the Japanese version. Due to MASSIVE editing, they are far different films.UPDATE: I watched ""Gojira"" (the Japanese version) and it is a better film. The interruptions by Raymond Burr's character were distracting and I'd score it a 9 in the original form.",positive
"I truly enjoy this film. I grew up watching every Kaiju film I could, and have always enjoyed this film particularly. The American release starring Raymond Burr, under the title ""Godzilla, King of Monsters"", was all I had seen for many years. The original Japanese version is far superior. The original is nearly twenty minutes longer, and has a much more complex storyline. The love triangle is explored more fully, and more is explained about Gojira's appearance. This is a stand alone film, all the others in the original series are sequels to the second film ""Godzilla Raids Again"", aka ""Gigantis, The Fire Monster"". The second series starting with ""Godzilla 1985"" (""Gojira Returns"" in Japanese), until ""Godzilla vs. Destroyah"" in 1996, are sequels to the first film.",positive
"In a long series of monster movies that have become frankly unoriginal and mundane, the one that started it all typically stands in an elite category that elevates it from its successors, and Godzilla is no exception. All the ones that came after this pale in comparison to the original king of the monsters. What makes the movie so unique is that it is much different from the others in the series, since this was the first of its kind so toho had no idea if it would even be popular. The film focuses on a dinosaur like monster that terrorizes the japanese mainland that is deduced to have been created by nuclear radiation, which is fitting because this is a terror that japan experienced firsthand. Less than a decade had passed since the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, so this event was still in the minds of many citizens. Godzilla himself obviously steals the show, and the audience will probably have a perverted sense of satisfaction seeing him obliterate and crush everything in his path. The movie does a commendable effort of conveying the fact that the public think he is unstoppable and that there are no weapons that can kill this thing, and they show a lot of genuinely disturbing things that wouldn't be shown in any other godzilla film. The people dying of radiation poisoning and choir of girls singing in hopelessness toward the end of the movie kind of bother me, and even to this day they are quite disturbing. Still, the original godzilla is without a doubt one of the best monster films ever made and will continue to both amaze and terrify audiences with his theater-jolting roar.",positive
"GODZILLA's chances for American distribution were nil until a savvy Hollywood company snapped up the rights, chopped out a chunk, and replaced the edited footage with new scenes starring Raymond Burr. The resulting film was a mix of bad acting, static cinematography, and expensive but essentially ""B"" level special effects--but when Godzilla stomped up from Tokyo Bay with the worst breath this side of Osaka, the American public took him to heart, and he's been a cult icon ever since.In theory, the film is a serious and subtle commentary on the dangers of nuclear warfare--and it might actually read that way in the original Japanese version, which is not (unfortunately) widely available. In practice, at least where the American version is concerned, it doesn't quite work out that way. The Japanese and American scenes blend very badly; the Japanese cast either overplays or underplays to a ridiculous degree; and Raymond Burr is about as expressive as Mount Rushmore. What with fainting lab assistants, boiling fish, hysterical sailors, and Burr's clenched lips, ""serious and subtle"" don't stand a chance.Then there's the monster. This was actually one of the most expensive films made in Japan up to that time--but even so, Japan was light years away from Hollywood when it came to special effects. Godzilla is very clearly a man in a rubber suit. Tokyo is very clearly a miniature set. But the surprising thing about this is that it's a darned good rubber suit and a darned good miniature set. And it proves extremely entertaining.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive
"This is one of my favourite Kaiju films(the second being The Great Monster, Yongary) and stars one of the best monsters ever devised. However, so few people seem to think this is a good movie where I live because it's not all CGI (yeah, kill me now). Stupid small towns. Never mind that though.Actually, I want to talk about the origins of Godzilla. For some reason people assume he was created from nuclear energy (and according to Monsters from the Movies, killed by it too) and thus have never actually watched the Japanese cut. Gojira was always there, a species of aquatic dinosaur that has been living on the sea floor for millions of years (they have the dates funny in the movie though, saying 1000's of years...). In fact, it makes sense that he could be a real animal. The spikes could be used like gills! His rough hide was caused from radiation burns though. He was driven up from the sea from his wounds and attacked Japan only in confusion. So, can we just have people stop claiming he was a mutant?",positive
"cgfoster9885,I would suggest that as a film student you formulate your own opinions of the movie rather than paraphrasing Roger Ebert's (sub-par) review.For a response to both your and Ebert's criticism's of Gojira, you may refer to my article 'A Crtitical Issue' which appears G-Fan #69.Both of you are entitled to your opinions, but you should be a little more aware of the subject matter you are criticizing (i.e. - do a little research, look at it from a global view rather than just an American one) before painting it as a 'bad' film. One wonders what the reaction of American film critics would be should their Japanese peers declare Citizen Kane as a terrible movie... probably the same as the one Japanese critics would view Ebert's review in....and if you happen to actually be Roger Ebert posting under a pseudonym, then shame on you.",positive
"Godzilla, or in Japanese Gojira the original giant Japanese monster in his debut in 1956 in the USA,with added scenes with Raymond burr (perry mason,ironside)i only seen the American version,but i would very much like to see the unedited Japanese version,the special effects are very good and Godzilla is a very big mean fire atomic breath firing monster to be reckoned with,filmed in black and white,Godzilla is no corny monster on the loose flick,its serious destructive stuff,if you recall all the other Godzilla movies in the mid sixties Godzilla was portrayed as a hero fighting baddies like Megalon and such.not this one.its the Japanese answer to beast from 20,000 fathoms which was also good.Raymond burr plays American reporter Steve martin(no not that Steve martin)who's in japan to visit an old friend.the dubbing is from good to bad,but who cares Godzilla stomps and stomps and the army and navy is useless with their weapons.this was directed by Inoshiro Honda,who went on to do many of the sequels.8 out of 10 a good movie.",positive
"Thanks to a fellow HTF member, I finally managed to catch the Godzilla film that started it all  after having already checked out 4 terrible later installments; I had virtually begun to despair of ever finding one of these that I liked, and I was afraid that the enduring appeal of this popular monster series would elude me completely! Interestingly, the opening segment  virtually a catalogue of the monster's preliminary attacks  proved awfully similar to the corresponding one in THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE (1959), which had actually preceded this viewing of GODZILLA! Anyway, the film basically plays like an updated version of the New York section of KING KONG (1933)  like the legendary ape, Godzilla is treated as a mythical creature  though, stretched to 96 minutes, it tends to drag in spots (especially when focusing on human relationships). That said, the mad scientist involved (a young man, for once, though following tradition by being a physically and emotionally scarred loner) is an intriguing enough character, while Takashi Shimura  an Akira Kurosawa regular featured mainly for marquee value, since he actually gets to do very little!  appears as a zoologist intent on studying the radioactive dinosaur and who also gets to deliver the concluding somber warning about the danger of nuclear experiments.The frequent Godzilla rampages are reasonably well-staged (though the aerial attacks are disappointingly ineffectual  while the monster itself seems totally impervious to every form of human resistance!); the underwater climax, then, involves a fanciful lethal weapon referred to as ""Oxygen Destroyer"" (I always find it amusing when English terminology is adopted in Asian films). The upbeat theme created for the monster  retained for subsequent outings  is, at once, stirring and infectious. The film unexpectedly displays crisp black-and-white cinematography (director Honda had been an assistant of Kurosawa!) and, similarly incongruous with the later kiddie-oriented offerings, are the sober devastation/hospital scenes  clearly inspired by the all-too-real impact of the fall-out, still fresh in the minds of the Japanese people.The only complaint I have about the edition I watched concerns the subtitles, which were written in too small a font. At this stage, I don't know if I'll eventually spring for the SE DVD  which is accompanied by the alternate U.S. version of the film (with additional footage featuring Raymond Burr inserted into the narrative) and a full-length Audio Commentary  but I was sufficiently impressed with the film (not that I'm prepared to re-evaluate the ones I'd seen previously, or that I actively look forward to other Godzilla efforts) to consider it a minor classic of the monster/sci-fi genre. Incidentally, my next Honda title should be DOGORA (1964)  which is being broadcast on late-night Italian TV this coming week-end...",positive
"Clearly more of an outcry against war, nuclear weapons, and violence, GOJIRA really packs an emotional wallop I never saw coming. It gets dead serious when, as Gojira attacks Tokyo, leaving buildings in rubble and the entire city ablaze, this mother nestles her three children in tight proclaiming that they will meet their father soon. If that doesn't grab you, nothing will. But, more importantly, it exposes the lingering effects of the dropped bomb and how that day still carries in the minds of many. With a bomb awakening a prehistoric beast from the Jurassic period, Gojira terrorizes a fishing island village. Soon, Tokyo itself, despite a well-equipped Japanese army blasting away at Gojira, will suffer the monster's wrath in a jaw-dropping rampage which impressed me a lot more than I expected. I was expecting a hokey, fun exercise of mayhem, but never realized that a powerful story lied in wait for me. The Japanese cast is surprisingly good with Akira Kurasawa vet Takashi Shimura(as paleontologist Kyohei Yamane who wishes not for Gojira's death, but for us, since this is a rare find in the field of science, to examine it..to test it)heading it with Akira Takarada and Momoko Kôchi as lovers wishing for Yamane's permission to marry. Akihiko Hirata comes out with the finest performance as a scarred, eye-patched scientist Serizawa who represents the horrifying example of the anguish derived from war..he is the creator of a potent ""Oxygen Destroyer"" that can separate oxygen from the atom resulting in the fish in his tank turning into mere skeletal bones. Emiko begs for Serizawa to use his invention to destroy Gojira because after the destruction of much of Tokyo, they need a savior to rid themselves of the seemingly indestructible behemoth. But, understanding the world(or more importantly, other warring countries seeking the ultimate weapon to hold global power)he wishes to keep his weapon secret..he wants good from his work not evil and has lost all faith in mankind.The film really has a loud message against the cruelty of war and I believe Gojira represents that ultimate monster in mankind constantly warring one with another using the atomic bomb as the weapon of choice to expose. As Kyohei says at the end, if we don't stop using the nuclear bombs, what Gojira monsters will be awakened.",positive
"This movie is an instant classic. It's full of everything; action, drama, sadness, and more! How is this movie not in the top 250? A lot of people say it looks fake but, it was made in the early 1950's and Japan didn't have a lot of effects. The only part in the movie that made me tear up, was when Godzilla died. Now, I know that the movie had two versions, one with Raymond Burr and one without. Both are very good. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes sci-fi films. It also made a big impact in filmmaking. It made a man in a rubber suit look scary! The characters are also developed very well. It's almost like you're with them. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",positive
Godzilla is awesome with or without special effects. That's always been the case. But my friend and I recently discovered that Godzilla is also cool with or without sound. Set the first Godzilla or Godzilla vs Biolante to Sepultura or Strapping Young Lad. Amazingly it fits like a glove. Scenes of destruction=loud crashing music. People scenes=emotional slower music.,negative
"Ishiro Honda directed this groundbreaking, heavily influential and immensely popular film that sees Japan attacked for the first time by Godzilla, a gigantic prehistoric lizard who has reawakened mutated and angry after radiation exposure from the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of WWII. The Japanese military seems helpless to stop him, since all their weapons prove useless, until troubled Dr. Serizawa discovers the perfect weapon to destroy the monster...if he can bring himself to use it. Though the F/X are primitive by today's standards, the script is unusually adult and sober-minded, with effective direction and music.First in a long-running(and disjointed) series that is still going today...",negative
"There is more to this movie than just a protest against nuclear weapons.There is definitely a lot of spoilers here so beware.Serizawa forgives his best friend and fiancé at the end when he says live happily together. Many secrets were kept by the main characters but somehow the main protagonist knew of his close friend's betrayal. His actions make him very much like a modern day Christ. Godzilla was an unstoppable killing machine that only grew stronger when hit with missiles and bullets. He was the oncoming apocalypse but Serizawa stopped it through his sacrifice.Knowing well that his weapon would create more problems for humanity he destroyed all knowledge of it along with himself when he defeated Godzilla. This movie was meant to be more than just a message for nuclear proliferation but about religious morality.The story of Christ is seen in many cultures, throughout many ages with different names but whether they use astronomical figures or earthly figures the message is still the same. Whether the writers wanted to or not they made a modern day Christ for the nuclear age. That's why a movie that I would normally view as a B movie would get a 9/10.The choir scene was particularly moving. Combined with the protagonist's affirmation this movie while not perfect created a powerful message.So in conclusion, don't let this little gem pass by I'd recommend you watch it.",positive
"Godzilla 1954.I thought I had purchased the 2014 version, when i realized it was the 1954 version.I was going to eject the movie and watch something else but I thought i give it a try. I don't regret watching it one bit. It was a very nice put together film even for its time. It flowed real good, despite not much English dialogue it was a great entertaining flick to watch.Do i wish I still watched the 2014 version sure, Am i disappointed not one bit.Acting, effects, visuals were awesome even for its time. This movie is truly great art.",positive
"What more can you ask for, hmm? I saw trailers for Godzilla movies in a special features section of some movie but I can't remember which. Needless to say, what I saw introduced me to the greatest monster of them all, and it was perfect that the first movie I got to see was this one. Of course it's just a guy in a rubber suit, but the low camera angles and the slowed down motion make the thought disappear. The fact that the movie is in black and white along with the music adds a more ominous feeling to the film. The movie has a very serious tone about nuclear weapons, and Godzilla himself is treated as a natural disaster. This is definitely one of my favorite movies in the franchise and it goes for just about everyone else who is a fan. This is a perfect introduction to the series, one that anyone who is looking to get started on should watched. Yes, Godzilla doesn't fight any other monsters in this one, but it doesn't take away what this film is about. A giant fire breathing monster that destroys everything in his path and is completely impervious to all human weapons, it just doesn't get any better. Not my favorite, but defiantly on the top ten list, and one that should not under any circumstances be passed up. Plus it makes for a pretty good film to watch on Halloween. You just can't beat him!",positive
"This film is not like many others Godzilla movies. It is dark and depressing. It has a more realistic Godzilla than later ones would have. The story is great too. It is also a surprisingly progressive film. It has the nuclear message, as well as a message about arranged marriages in Japan(which was a thing at the time.)",positive
"Most American moviegoers are used to Godzilla's film debut as featuring Raymond Burr as a reporter who is badly injured while covering the giant monster's attack on Tokyo.  Very few, and lucky stateside viewers were able to see GOJIRA, as it was released in Japan in 1954.  (You probably already heard that Raymond Burr's scenes was spliced into the film for American release.  The resulting film was released here as GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS.)In it's unaltered form, GOJIRA moves very rapidly as it tells of myserious ship disasters, followed by sightings of a fearsome 150 foot tall monster (the American dubbed version credits him as 400 feet tall) The performances by the cast is perfection in the acting craft.  Takeshi Shimura, one of the biggets draws in japanese film at the time leads the cast, followed by newcomers like Akira Takarada, Ahikio Hirata, Momoko Kochi and Kenji Sahara.  These actors would find steady employment in Toho's monster films for the next 20 years.And the scenes where Godzilla attacks Tokyo, still some of the creepiest moments found in a monster film.  A 100% must see!",negative
"After introducing myself to the Godzilla series with a couple of the crazy 90's films where he battled the likes of Mechagodzilla and Space Godzilla, I figured it was time I see where it all began: the 1954 Japanese film GOJIRA. I sat down to watch this movie expecting more of what I'd seen so far from other Godzilla films, including massive battles and melodramatic performances, except on a smaller budget. I couldn't have been more wrong. The original 1954 film not only carried itself with the utmost dignity but it also came with a message that resonated socially with the Japanese population following the end of World War II. It begins with the mysterious destruction of some Japanese fishing boats at sea. The Japanese are terrified and an investigation is started, led by lead scientist Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura). The case brings them to Odo Island where they first come face to face with the menace that is Gojira/Godzilla, a 160-ft. tall dinosaur beast infused with atomic radiation and an enormous thirst for destruction. When he begins to lumber his way to the capitol of Tokyo, the Japanese buckle down and muster what forces they can to defend themselves but nothing appears to faze him. Japan's only hope lies with Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) and his research, if he can bring himself to share his terrifying new discovery with the world. And personally, I found myself let down by the whole thing so, Godzilla fans, please don't hate me.It's not that I demand mindless monster battle action from a Godzilla film. I can see the franchise took a major detour at some point and veered into some weird territory by the time it got around to psychic space moths and giant transforming robots. I love that the original GOJIRA is a more deliberately paced story with a message to share with its audience. My problem is that the movie was just too boring. At 100 minutes, it's just too slow to keep my interest. Maybe it's because I grew up with modern Hollywood and it's screwed with my attention span, but I doubt it because there are plenty of other movies from that era that I can still enjoy. The limited budget is quaint and I've got no problem with the production value. We can see the strings on the planes and there are obvious differences between the man in the suit and the puppet used for close up shots of the monster. It's cool. I just wish the movie had moved along at a better pace. Everything is very tense and over dramatic, and everyone seems to speak with a glassy-eyed stare and a lowered voice to emphasize the weight of the situation. GOJIRA is not your average monster movie. It doesn't revel in the mindless destruction of the monster stomping through town. It mourns it and gives pause to consider what brought them to this point and how it should have been avoided. Don't misconstrue it to seem that I have a problem with the movie's message. I actually really respect it for that and, as a result, it's got more going for it than any of the previous Godzilla movie's I've seen.But let's face it, if this wasn't the first movie of its kind (a Japanese giant monster movie), GOJIRA probably wouldn't be as fondly remembered as it is. I might respect it for what it is, but that doesn't make it an awesome movie. It plods along at a snail's pace and the film's pseudoscience is laughable (setting the precedent for all it's future sequels, I guess). Suspension of disbelief is an absolute must when you're talking about a giant mutant dinosaur with atomic breath but, come on, I'm pretty sure the film's ""secret weapon"" developed by Dr. Serizawa isn't fooling anyone. You don't have to be a chemist to see it and think to yourself, ""You know, I don't think that's right."" I don't know. It just reeks of laziness to take advantage of your audience's (at that time) assumed ignorance and come up with a ""science-y"" sounding name for a weapon to explain your deus ex machina plot device to wrap up your monster movie. You can't have it both ways. You can't be a super-serious metaphor for your nation's fear of atomic weapons while at the same time feeding us corny science schlock. Your vibes conflict and it helps to kill my interest. GOJIRA is mildly enjoyable to this modern viewer and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves the giant monster genre. It's got a massive fan base so obviously there's something I'm missing here. It's got some real strong performances from its cast, the themes are intriguing, and the retro effects are fun but it's just a real drag with a third act that fizzles.",negative
"Of all the kaiju classics that have surfaced on the cinematic canvas over the years, Godzilla (also called Gojira) remains the greatest & most influential of them all. Far more human than most monster films ever aspire to be, it is an emotionally riveting, thematically rich & technically groundbreaking achievement that not only delivers a spectacle-laden extravaganza but also doubles as a sobering examination of post-war Japan still reeling from the nuclear devastation.Directed by Ishiro Honda, the first entry in what would become the longest running film franchise in history plays out like a straightforward horror movie with tension & terror engulfing the screen whenever its giant monster makes an appearance. The best surprise however is the poignant human drama unfolding at its centre and the care & sincerity with which these characters are scripted & rendered. Godzilla itself serves as a metaphor for nuclear weapons, and Honda is rather unsubtle about it.The special effects may look dated today but the human drama still holds up and retains its potency & relevance. And on the strength of its plot & characters alone, the film has miraculously stood the test of time. From miniatures to suitmation, all the technical wizardry on display is pioneering work of its time, and the distraction from it is minimal as the dark mood & grim aura never leaves the scene & setting. On top of that, the honest performances, timeless cinematography, strong score & brutal imagery only elevate the experience.Overall, Godzilla is a powerhouse of ambition & artistry and an enduring classic for the ages that's more than capable of leaving the newcomers in a dazzled state with its profoundly human & allegorically layered treatment of a monster movie template. Bringing on screen a fictional creation that would go on to become a worldwide pop culture icon in the subsequent years and spawn a franchise that still breathes today, Godzilla is every bit deserving of the legacy it has garnered and is much better than what I was anticipating. Definitely worth your time. Highly recommended.",negative
"Shortly after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, inspired by the release of the 1933 American classic ""King Kong"", Ishiro Honda transposed the nuclear trauma of an entire nation through this film. This ""classic"" Godzilla embodies all the suffering and horror of a nuclear weapon and the rich black and white aesthetic as well as the unforgettable main theme (soundtrack) only reinforces the blackness of the storyline.In contrast with its multiple sequels, this first ""Godzilla"" is unique by the standards of its time, and rich in metaphors and innuendos that denounce the use of nuclear power and the selfishness of man.A classic piece.",positive
"November 3 1954 marked the release of a film that was unlike anything else seen before in Japanese cinema. This was the original Godzilla. It's success was unprecedented and paved the way for Japanese popular culture to enter the world stage. It's a classic that, while may have its flaws and seem dated the modern viewer, nonetheless delivers a message and moral that stands the test of time. The origins of Godzilla lie not within film, but in the terrifying reality that Japan, and the rest of the world face in a post war era.On August 6, 1945 the first atomic weapon was used against human lives in the city of Hiroshima. Three day later Nagasaki would suffer the same fate. Over 200,000 lives would be lost, and thousands more would suffer the consequences for the rest of their lives. Nine years later a small Japanese fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, bore witness to the first Hydrogen bomb test. When the crew made it back to shore they quickly became sick of radiation poising. A few months later a film was released to Japanese theaters. In its opening scene a small vessel is engulfed by a flash of light, and all of its crew perishes shortly there after. This is the original Godzilla, one of many atomic age monster films that took the world by storm in the 1950s. The plot shares many similarities with various other monster films of the age, but among them all Godzilla stands out as the most sincere and potent. This mainly has to do with it's uniquely Japanese perspective. The images that you see in this film are not just of a monster destroying a city, rather they are the manifestations of a nation's fears. Both of its people and the individuals who made this film.Director Ishiro Honda was in a unique position to make this film. He had served as a solider in WWII and upon his return to Japan walked through the devastation of Hiroshima. For Honda, the idea that humanity could create such terrible weapons and impart such suffering onto their fellow human beings was a horrifying thought. In the film a weapon is introduced that is able to destroy Godzilla. And our characters are hesitant, they face the turmoil and conflict of their decision. They can unleash this weapon and destroy Godzilla, but in doing so might create a nightmare far worst than the monster. This is the strength of the film, and of Godzilla as a character. It's not just about the monster, but what that monster represents.Godzilla is indeed a man (Haruo Nakajima) is a suit among miniatures. But the sheer struggle and effort that went into making the effects and bringing the monster to life cannot be understated. That Godzilla is a man in a suit gives the monster a unique humanity, almost as if it's a distorted reflection of ourselves. Add to this the wonderful black & white cinematography along with a powerful score from composer Akira Ifukube, and you have a film that rises above its limitations.To say Godzilla is a metaphor for the atomic bomb is an oversimplification, he is the manifestation of it, a representation of the terrible things human beings are capable of doing to one another. Of course the character of Godzilla evolved, but the original remains as a classic that has earned its place in film history. It birthed an entire genre and left an undeniable legacy that has inspired fans and filmmakers for decades. This is the original Godzilla, a monster movie with a heart and a message quite unlike any other.",positive
"This 1954 ""Gojira"" movie is the movie that kickstarted the franchise. But oddly so, since the movie hardly was all that fantastic.Granted, we need to keep in mind that the movie was made in 1954, but still, it wasn't a particularly thrilling or exciting movie. I found the storyline to be slow, dull and rather mundane actually, and I started to drift towards dreamland more than once throughout the course of the 1 hour and 36 minutes that the movie ran for, because it felt like a 3 or 4 hour long movie.It was interesting, though, that they opted to kill Godzilla off in this movie. But I guess they weren't counting on it sparking a massive franchise.The special effects were actually fair enough, again taking into consideration that the movie was from 1954. Some scenes though were just so poorly made that you could see it was toys and miniature models being used, and I doubt it would even pass for being realistic back in 1954.For me the movie was way too lacking on kaiju action, and all the human drama was just too stupid and tedious to witness on the screen. Hence, it was severely dragging down the movie in terms of enjoyment and entertainment value for me. My rating of ""Gojira"" (aka ""Godzilla"") is a mere four out of ten stars. This was hardly a memorable addition to the ""Godzilla"" franchise for me.",negative
"NOTE: when referring to this film I'm only talking about the original version, not the one with Raymond Burr (which wasn't bad, by the way).GOJIRA is one dark, depressing mamma-jamma, simply a film that American monster movie makers would have been incapable of making. With the horrors of the atomic bomb still painfully fresh in the Japanese national memory, Gojira was the perfect embodiment of a death beyond imaginging, translated from a culture whose mythology is steeped in ogre-like death-bringers. Usually seen at night, Gojira is a dark, implacable shape that proceeds with no point or purpose, leaving agonizing tragedy in its wake.What really sets this apart from its many spinoffs and sequels is the clearly addressed danger of atomic energy as a force that man can never control. One important point made in this film that has been glossed over by the later films (and indeed by most Gojira fans) is that the 1954 appearance of this creature is NOT the first time that it showed up. As illustrated in centuries-old woodprints, the monster that was later irradiated and reawakened as Gojira attacked Japan centuries ago and was driven back into the sea by a group of brave (and probably insane!!!) samurai. Spears and balls may have driven Big ""G"" away back in the days, but the bomb rewrote the rules, big time.The other very interesting thing in this film is Dr. Serizawa, a brilliant scientist who has the means to destroy Gojira, but has serious reasons for not wanting to do so. Rent the flick and see what I mean. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",negative
"I continue to be impressed at how the original ""Godzilla"" still holds up very well as an eerie horror/monster flick today, and praise must be given to all elements of the technical crew who worked on it.   Comparing it to the American movie that directly inspired it, Ray Harryhausen's ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" makes you see why ""Godzilla"" can still seem scary today while Harryhausen's is just fun without being menacing.  The documentary style filming, the black and white photography, effective Akira Ifukube score and fluid motion of the monster jells together in a way that no other Godzilla movie, straight or campy ever matches.It is fashionable to call the American added scenes with Raymond Burr an annoying intrusion, but compared to other intrusive American elements in later Japanese sci-fi movies, it's remarkable how Burr actually manages to fit in quite seamlessly with less bad dubbing than we later saw in other Godzilla films. He also handles the material a lot better than any other American actor who tried a hand at these films years later like Nick Adams or Russ Tamblyn.As for the anti-nuclear allegory of Godzilla, I tend to ignore this point when enjoying this film because I'm one of those who think the Japanese could use a little reminder that their firsthand experience of nuclear terror only happened because of some bigger terrors that took place first at places like Nanking and Pearl Harbor.Forget the bloated misfire of last year's American effort and enjoy the original (Godzilla's roar can still induce nightmares among the grown-ups). It's still the king!",negative
"The original version of Godzilla has finally been released in the USA.  I just saw it last weekend at a movie theater in San Francisco.  I was quite excited by the prospect of finally seeing the film in its uncut glory, but was just a tad bit underwhelmed by the experience.Basically I would rank Godzilla with the short list of 1950s monster movies that are surprisingly watchable -- Them, Invasion of Body Snatchers, The Day the Earth Stood Still -- because they do a good job commenting on a current social malady.Like many of the films of the era, though, Godzilla, even in its original language, is still filled with too many corny conversations and phony plot points to remain something that could be called a masterpiece of filmmaking as some here are suggesting it is.  It will probably be better than what you are expecting from a Godzilla film, but remember, it still basically boils down to a guy in a monster suit stepping on miniature houses and knocking over toy trains. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but 'one of the greatest films ever made' this is not.",negative
"Really well done movie, good plot, decent acting, amazing special effects (for 1954) a fantastic and scary battle scene as Godzilla rampages and destroys, stomps on and burns down, with his fiery breath a city after they try to electrocute him. Hundreds of extras used; reporters, fishermen, townsfolk. A bit of a romance. This must have been terrifying for Japanese audiences in the 50's, so many similarities to the bombings they'd just faced during WW2 including radiation sickness.The ending is as expected, sad, Godzilla is just minding his business, sleeping at he bottom of the sea when they come to kill him. The music is fantastic for this sequence Its meant to be sad, not just me feeling sorry for the monster as I always do. Sacrifice on the part of the scientist, maybe suicide? A message in closing, dire warning about nuclear testing.",negative
"In the early part of 1954 the crew of a Japanese tuna-fishing boat with the tragically ironic name of 'Lucky Dragon' was affected by radiation fallout from an immensely powerful nuclear test carried out by the Americans. This required that all twenty-three crew members be hospitalised for fourteen months. There arose a strong anti-nuclear movement and the following year millions of Japanese signed petitions protesting against continued American testing in the Pacific, to no avail.
During this period Toho productions released two films that caught the prevailing mood.
In 1955 came Akira Kurosawa's brilliant and aptly named 'I Live in Fear' which failed commercially, was effectively consigned to oblivion for a number of years and even now remains a neglected masterpiece.
A year earlier Kurosawa's friend and sometime collaborator Ishiro Honda filmed 'Gojira' which was a box office smash and in which the opening scene is inspired by the Lucky Dragon incident.
Dear old Hollywood, no doubt encouraged by the success of the recently re-released 'King Kong' and 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms', purchased the rights to 'Gojira' and proceeded to cut, re-edit and re-shoot so as to remove any 'contentious' elements. Added 'gravitas' is provided by the insertion of an American reporter played by Raymond Burr. His is a solid presence but he is required to do little more than look glum and smoke a pipe.
Ishiro Honda made no secret of the fact that his film was designed to shock and in this he succeeds admirably! The horrific carnage and destuction caused by the rampaging monster is intended to replicate the effects of atomic warfare and the images of burning cities and maimed victims in overcrowded hospitals could not fail to have had a deeply painful and terrifying resonance.
Unsurprisingly the entire cast performs with conviction and mention must be made of Takashi Shimura who plays a paleontologist. He worked extensively with Kurosawa and here Honda utilses his rather dour and sorrowful demeanour to great effect.
Undeniably indebted to 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms', Honda's mise-en scene, the films striking relevance and its moral overtones make this a far superior piece. The special effects are stunning and the score iconic.
Apologies to devotees of 'King Kong' but in the humble opinion of this viewer, 'Gojira' remains the greatest 'creature feature' of them all.",positive
"I have never been a big fan of giant monster movies. I find that there is some emotional disconnect when the creature is as big as a multitude of humans. There's no direct interaction between the creature and those who are dealing with it, so it takes some careful execution to make a compelling story from that standpoint. The original Godzilla might do the best job I've seen from one of these movies, because it spends large chunks of time introducing us to a small handful of people that are trying to figure out how to save their country from this creature that threatens to destroy them all. I suspect if they had targeted it even more on that part of the story, and only had Godzilla show up for brief moments throughout, I might have really liked this movie.Instead, there are some long scenes where the entire movie stops in its tracks so that we can revel in a guy tromping around on miniatures while in a rubber suit. We all know that's what is really going on, but I still found the effect good enough so you could get lost in it all. The miniatures were well-crafted, so it rarely looked like some kid playing with his toys. Also, the black-and-white cinematography does the monster a lot of favors. A ton can be hidden by merely shooting at night without having to worry about the colors giving away what they're doing. I think the other thing that makes Godzilla work is the fact that it isn't completely about a rampaging lizard, but it speaks more to the nuclear threat and general fear of what mankind is doing to nature. I do wish they had leaned further into that aspect of the story, but the film is still decent and one I'm glad I've seen.",negative
"You know, it is very hard to visualize a good, serious review that can truly do justice to a movie like Gojira. I have thought many days on how i can somehow create an analysis that will help viewers try to understand this masterpiece, and this is my hardest effort.Gojira tells the story of a prehistoric creature mutated by nuclear testing and radiation. This beast, called Gojira by superstitious islanders, is the very incarnation of pure, merciless, deadly evil that will kill and destroy purely for the reason that this monster is, literally, a living atomic bomb. Unfortunately, it is not America that the beast attacks, but Japan, the only country ever to have suffered the horrors of a nuclear bomb. Indestructible, pure evil, and completely oblivious to feelings such as sympathy, happiness, and pain, Gojira is a nightmare that will suck out your hope, and slaughter every single human in its path.Evil incarnate.But this is probably not the Godzilla you know and love. You are probably thinking of the silly, comical Japanese Barney that fights aliens and dances like a four-year-old, complete with a cute appearance and cheesy monster fights. Not the evil, purely destructive demon called Gojira.I have not much time to finish this review, so I must, must let you understand the extreme importance of this film. When the creature was dubbed and released in America under the butchered name Godzilla, he was meant to be a typical 50's monster dude that destroyed cities, and that was pretty much it. The flawed yet extremely underrated American remake in 1998 didn't help the reputation of this saurian devil.But watch the original, uncut, and undubbed Japanese ""Gojira."" Watch it, and try to truly understand the very important messages and meanings in the film. There may be a mad, scientist and fake-looking monster action, but there is a serious heart to the film. If we, mankind, continue to invent weapons of terrible power and use them on our brothers, the entire planet and our species will surely be utterly destroyed. Watch ""Gojira"" again, and understand the meaning, the power, and the horror of the murderous creature that Americans call Godzilla. The message is very much there, and must be heard and understood by all, if our kind is to have any hope of survival against our own destructive power.Watch ""Gojira"" again. And again. And again. And again. It may just teach mankind (and you) a few lessons.",positive
"The Japanese version of this TOHO scifi classic is the one that many people should see.  Much more serious with less of the camp value the American version had.  Gojira/Godzilla(1954) also benefits from having more footage of Akira Kurosawa actor, Takeshi Shiumra.  Engrossing as a social commentary and entertaining as a Scifi thriller.
The American version known as Godzilla:King of the Monsters(1956) is a complete travesty.  Suffers from extensive cuts of fifteen to twenty minutes.  The inserts of Raymond Burr are awkward and add nothing to the film.  Godzilla:King of the Monsters(1956) had been badly dubbed and is an example of how a gem such as Gojira(1954) can be mutilated once released in the USA.
Released almost ten years after the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagaski.  The creature Gojira is symbolic of the atomic bomb and its consequences.  An insightful film of the fear that people felt during the nuclear age.  Gives Gojira(1954) a grim and serious tone that many of the films in the long running series lack.
The other inspiration for Gojira(1954) comes from Ray Bradbury's short story called THE FOG HORN(Beast From 20000 Fathoms{1953} was also inspired by the short story).  THE FOG HORN deals with a dinosaur who is living in modern times and goes off to the nearest lighthouse whenever a foghorn sounds off. Faithful to the short story in the idea of showing little of the big creature in the first half.  The whole sense of dread found in THE FOG HORN can also be seen in Gojira(1954).
Special Effects of Gojira are very good for the 1950s.  Some of the effects are amazing and breathtaking to watch especially in the fall of the city scenes.  Its amazing that the effects are this good without the use of CGI. They are the best in a low budget Japanese B movie.
A touching part of Gojira(1954) is the tragic love triangle of Ogata, Emiko, and Dr. Serizawa.  This element is downplayed in the American version.  One of the most crucial sub plots of the movie because of what happens in the end.  The relationship of Emiko and Dr. Serizawa is very cold but respectful.
The scene involving the destruction of the city is powerful and realistic. The image of Godzilla standing over a burning city is quite jaw dropping. The most powerful image in a Godzilla film.  The aftermath of the city's destruction echos the aftermath of the tragedies at Hiroshima and Nagaski.
Dr. Serizawa is a tragic figure because he sacrifices himself so his work would not be used for anything involving war.  Its heartbreaking to see him make his decision near the end of Gojira.  He is a complex man as well as a three deminsional character.  The sacrifice motif is an important part of the motion picture.
An intellengent Science Fiction thriller that gives some food for thought with the dangers of the nuclear age.  A much more intellegent movie than most people give credit.  Dr. Yamane is someone who wants to keep Gojira alive in order to know how a dinosaur could live in the modern era. Intellgence is a major plus for Gojira/Godzilla(1954).
The Godzilla theme song is one of the most popular and recognizable film songs of all time.  The acting is deep and very satisfying.  The huge success of this motion picture ensured the beginning of an enduring and popular Science Fiction series.  Gojira/Godzilla(1954) has not been surpassed as a masterful Japanese SCIFI feature.",negative
Well recently I have been watching all the Godzilla movies. I loved this series as a young kid. I'm going to be reviewing all of these movies on this subreddit. Well are first episode is going to be Gojira 1954. I love this movie. It is probably the only Godzilla movie that gave me nightmares as a child. It scared me so much. Now that I watch it again I realize that this one is not only the scariest but the most well done. Yeah you heard me. A movie made in 1954 is better than the 2014 one. So sue me. Now is this my favorite Godzilla movie. No that honor goes to Son of Godzilla (So sue me). Now if I were to give this movie a rating as a child I would give it a 3/4. Yes I rate movies out of 4. So sue me. I now have more experience with film and I understand it more. I would give it a 3.5/4.,positive
"Godzilla would go on to become a huge cult success with many films being based around the giant lizard; but all this never really inspired much enthusiasm from me, and after seeing the original Japanese film; my opinion of it all hasn't really improved much. The obvious film to compare this one to would be the 1933 masterpiece 'King Kong', and indeed the two monsters shared a film together in 1962 (which I've not seen). There really is no competition as to which is the better individual film, however, with King Kong taking all the honours. The basic story here is obvious to anyone who knows anything about Godzilla and, of course, it focuses on a giant dinosaur that emerges from the sea. The film was released during the cold war, so naturally its nuclear weapons that are to blame and pretty soon a small fishing island is being torn apart by the blood-thirsty monster. Some time later, an expedition is lead to the island, which leads to the rediscovery of Godzilla, who then threatens to provide a much bigger problem for the whole of Japan...My main problem with this film is the lack of entertainment value. The director appears to be making some point about nuclear weapons (the film was made just nine years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), and the point, which is is made through a giant rampaging, does carry a bit more weight than it maybe should. The film deserves kudos for the special effects; while no more impressive than the 21 year old effects seen in King Kong, it's always good to see a film where effort has gone into bringing the action to life. This is all good, but for me the film didn't deliver what I wanted. I really just wanted some entertainment and Godzilla doesn't deliver enough of it. The sequences in which the monster is attacking are all good and worthy of note, but the story surrounding the central characters is very weak indeed. The monster itself is a classic cinematic icon (though not as much so as King Kong, or at least not in the west), and every scene which features it is memorable. Overall, its obvious why this film had a place in history and I can understand why it is well liked; but it didn't do much for me.",negative
"After watching both films, with and without the commentaries, I have to say that my appreciation for the original film, directed by Ishirô Honda, and written by Honda and Shigeru Kayama, as well as the American version, often derided as a bastardization, only grew. No, neither film can really be considered a great film, but great movies? Hell, yes! The difference between the two is the difference between a great novel and a great comic book. Great films really move one to think more deeply about life, whereas a great movie does that a bit, perhaps, but more often simply greatly entertains, and is well made. Both versions of Godzilla easily qualify on that score, and both films, with their anti-atomic messages, and unflinching look at destruction, are better films than the original King Kong, which is still a great movie itself. What raises Godzilla, and especially Gojira, above King Kong, despite the rubber suited monster which is scoffed at by stop motion action enthusiasts, is that the Japanese monster tale still has resonance today, and can be seen as an allegory, whereas King Kong is essentially just a ripping good yarn. In short, King Kong is more akin to Paul Bunyan while Godzilla is more like the Olympian or Norse gods.Yes, Godzilla owes a great debt to King Kong, whose re-release in 1952 was a box office smash, far greater than its original release in 1933, but it even owes more to the box office success to The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (based upon Ray Bradbury's short story The Fog Horn)- which was a 1953 box office hit, just a year before Gojira was made and became one of the most expensive Japanese films made to that date. Yet, Godzilla had a political resonance and emotional depth, especially in its human characterizations, that both King Kong and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms lacked. Kong was basically a victim and the Beast was just a hungry lizard, incidentally called a Rhedosaurus. Godzilla was a byproduct of the atomic age, even if, cleverly, Honda covered his ass by never explicitly showing this to be true. This posit of the beast's origins is all from a modern human perspective, for we know that Godzilla, like Kong, is a small island's legendary native god. In Godzilla the island is Odo, in King Kong it's Skull Island. The Beast, on the other hand, is explicitly shown as being created by an atomic blast, just as other creatures in 1950s films were, even if that's merely an excuse for it to just go hunting. Godzilla's motives are never made clear. It does not seem to be seeking food, so is it nature's revenge on humanity, or a cosmic random bit of fury? Yes, both films have manifest flaws. There are logical gaps in the plots of both: why, for example, do the Japanese only seek to protect Tokyo? How do they know the beast won't rampage across the country, or go to Korea? The building of the electric fence to defend the city is nonsensical, and occurs with a rapidity that, even assuming politicians agreed on a plan of civil action, simply could not be done in a few days- especially if this Tokyo was the same one that Shimura's character from Ikiru worked for as a bureaucrat. Also, Godzilla seems to often change shape, size and appearance, within seconds- although this can be dismissed more easily in the more oneiric American version, and there are visible wires on the missiles and airplanes; but both films, especially in Gojira, more than make up for such lapses and shortcomings with the passion and, yes, vision, of the works. The monster in both films is indiscriminate carnage, yet there is the shot, just before Serizawa kills them both, when we see Godzilla peacefully napping in the sea, almost yawning, and we realize that the carnage wrought is not retribution nor evil. It just is, and it will be either it or us, humanity, that survives, for we've seen the bodies in hospitals, the burn victims, the radiation poisoning. It can be no other way. And, unlike most other monster films, the heroes in these films, especially Gojira (where the true lead character seems to shift throughout the film, almost like Godzilla's size and appearance), are fallible little mortals whose heroism comes from their choices, not their strength nor super abilities.And this is what humanizes these monster movies, not films, and makes them affect a viewer willing to suspend their disbelief. After all, is a giant, rampaging atomic reptile really any more unbelievable than a huge ape who lusts for a woman a twentieth its size, bloodsucking vampires, aliens who grow out of pods, or have acid for blood? I think not. No, neither Gojira, nor Godzilla, King Of The Monsters, is a great film. So what? They are great movies- a thing that is a rarity enough, and amongst the four or five best monster movies ever made. This DVD set should finally debunk claims to the contrary and let Godzillaphiles come out of the closet and proudly proclaim themselves what they are. I am one; long live the roar!",positive
"Gojira(Godzilla) takes place in the 50s, when Japan was still reviving from WW2. On an ordinary fishing boat sailing near Oda Island, a flash of lightning has came out of nowhere and sank the boat. A rescue team went out to investigate, but failed to find the remains of the boat. A group of reporters went to Oda Island to question the locals on what might of happened to the sailors.The locals say & believe that it was the wrath of the legendary sea monster: ""Godzilla"". This made the reporters skeptical about this incident. This was reported back to the main lands, and a Paleontologist, Dr. Kyohei Yamane requests an investigative party to be sent to Oda Island for farther analyze on this mystery. When Dr. Yamane made it to the island, he has found discoveries that the so called ""Godzilla"" responsible for the incident is a dinosaur that survived the prehistoric times & was awakened by the atomic explosions that occurred in the last war. The massive amount of Strontium-90 from the bombs has mutated the creature into a giant radiated carnivore.And soon the mammoth monster will rise from the ocean and seek to kill/destroy whatever it sees.Despite it being made 52 years ago & having old special effects and the early use of costume/model sets(which is very common in later Japanese Sci-Fi flicks). It has a good story to it. As well as a convincing cast of characters, romance, terror, and drama. Gojira is a classic Japanese B-Movie. And this was only the beginning for everyone's favorite atomic dinosaur. As it became a cult classic in Japan within the later years and has became welcomed in the American culture as well.",positive

Just finished the first one and I already feel like nothing will ever manage to even get close, in terms of both narrative value and quality of high-end entertainment. Gojira is a monster movie where the real enemy is not the monster itself, but what it represents: pure, ghastly, undiscriminating devastation. And boy, is there destruction in here...",positive
"Watched Godzilla featuring Akira Takarada(Half Human) as Hideo Ogata, Momoko Kochi(A Womans Heart Released) as Emiko Yamane, Akihiko Hirata(The Lone Journey) as Dr. Daisuke Serizawa, Takashi Shimura(Rashomon) as Dr. Kyohei Yamane and Hauro Nakajima(Seven Samurai) as Godzilla.As Much I love the Original King Kong and is talked about in Film History but I like the Original Godzilla more so also it is Metaphor for Nuclear War as well also teaches the folly of humanity and the ever present of Nuclear war it brilliant also Godzilla makes it an impact despite his 8:45 even when he is off camera also his rampage is iconic.Amazing Producing By Tomoyuki Tanaka(The Last Embrace), Amazing Iconic Score by Akira Ifukube(The Quiet Duel) and Cinematography By Masao Tamai and Direction by Ishiro Hondo(Eagle Of The Pacific) A B Movie Monster That Got Elevated Due To Its Subject Matter 8/10.",positive
"Somehow, this film seems to be cheapened by the American remake of 1998. And although this film probably had one tenth of the budget, Ishiro Hondas direction, the script and the black and white film more than make up for the lack of big budget Hollywood special effects. Although the Toho studios have made dozens of Godzilla films, this is by far and away the best, none of this ""Godzilla the protector of Japan"" crap, just a 164 feet tall radioactive monster whose virtually invulnerable burning the heart out of Tokyo. This film also has a strong anti-war message. The 3 recent Godzilla films, ending with final wars are quite a good continuation of the story, its a shame final wars got trounced by ""Howls moving castle"" at the box office in Japan.From what I understand, Akira Kurosawa always wanted to make a Godzilla film but Toho Studios wouldn't allow him for fear of budget costs... Shame on them.",positive
"This is the greatest monster movie ever. Period. Actually, it's more than an monster movie. It's an allegory for nuclear war, it's an epic, and it's a pinnacle in Japanese Tokusatsu(special effects).The movie starts out with a Japanese fishing boat being destroyed near Odo island. Meanwhile a storm hits the island along with some thing else, bringing great death and destruction. Anyways that's all I'll mention for now. This film is actually very similar to the beast from 20000 fathoms(1953). Which was one of the inspirations for this film(along with the lucky dragon incident). Of course let's talk about the star monster and antagonist of this film: Godzilla.His appearance is instantly recognizable: a saurian body, Mable leaf shaped dorsal fins, and a long reptilian tail. This iconic image combined with an ability to breathe a highly radioactive ray( often confused with fire in the states) makes for a terrifying monster. Everything from the strange natives of Odo island to the destruction of Tokyo would seem cliché: if it wasn't for the fact this film started those cliché's.",positive
"Ishiro Honda'a Gojira was a very well directed film. It displays horror, drama, as well as sci-fi. This film was made after the bombing of japan, because it was an American bombing's radioactivity that created Godzilla. This filmed entertained me a lot because I've seen the more updated version and wondered how the original Godzilla. This movie, regardless that it was Japanese and had to read the English subtitles, was a entertaining film that really made me wonder if people really got scared of this back then. In the movie the couple tries to get the professor to give up his plan that he knew will destroy the monster. After a lot of attempts the professor unveils his device to destroy Godzilla once and for all. Then he goes and sacrifices himself to destroy Godzilla with a device that takes out the oxygen from way and leaves them just in a skeleton. This movie ends with a happy ending for Japan to not ever have to see Godzilla ever again, and they will live to see the sun shine again. This movie had a lot of entertainment and it lived up more or less to my expectation, but their were some minor issues that kept the movie from being believable, other than the fact that there is a monster in the movie. For example, some of the props such as the broken helicopter or the car that rolls over in the film were toys that could easily be found at any Wal Mart or so. Even Godzilla at a certain point was also a toy since they will rotate him and his arms or mouth don't move. The directing in this film though was superb and the acting was fairly decent since some of the times the main character would burst out crying, but its not that, that was bad, is was how she over exaggerated it to a point where you know its not believable. But this film was entertaining to watch.",positive
"On the surface, Godzilla seems like a fairly unremarkable monster movie, in which a giant lizard stomps all over defenceless cities; however, bear in mind that the film was made less than a decade after the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and the film takes on an allegorical quality that makes for a far more interesting and haunting experience. Godzilla is the physical manifestation of the threat of nuclear devastation, while the death and destruction the prehistoric terror leaves in his wake is highly reminiscent of the horrific aftermath of bombs Little Boy and Fat Man, dropped by the Americans in 1945.Further allegorical content comes in the form of scientist Serizawa, who has developed a device that he hopes might one day benefit mankind, but which is so powerful that it could be used as a weapon were it to fall into the wrong hands. Should he allow his discovery to be used to destroy Godzilla, but risk greater disaster in the process? It's an ethical dilemma that brings to mind J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""father of the atomic bomb"".The plot is simple: several boats are sunk off the coast of Japan, the cause unknown. The reason becomes clear when Godzilla, a massive monstrous lizard with radioactive breath, emerges from the sea to cause trouble on land. As Godzilla stomps and smashes, Serizawa wrestles with his conscience, ultimately agreeing to allow his device to be used to stop the beast. Director Ishirô Honda's handling of the destruction is impressive, but it is more delicate moments such as the mother huddling with her children amidst the wreckage, waiting for the end to come, that hit the hardest.",positive
"""Gojira"" is the best-known of the Japanese monster movies, which spawned a mini-industry in themselves with several sequels, not to mention the far inferior American version of 1998.It's interesting to compare the film to its famous US counterparts ""King Kong"", ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Cloverfield"". As with Kong, Gojira has a near-mythical status, with some of the cast dismissing him as a mere fiction, while others claim he is real. A notable aspect of the early scenes in the film is the revelation that a girl would be sacrificed to Gojira to keep him away from the islands, and we also see a native dance serving as a ritual in this regard. The parallels between these scenes and those in ""King Kong"" is very evident, as is the incident when the Tokyo train is derailed (just like the commuter train in the earlier film).Gojira's arrival is announced by a loud - and ominous - series of thuds, which prefigure those of the T Rex in ""Jurassic Park"". The use of electricity to ward off Gojira (unsuccessfully) again looks forward to the electric fence in the Jurassic Park complex which features heavily in the film.Moving forward to the unnamed monster in ""Cloverfield"", both monsters have a lack of any sign of humanity which makes us emphasise with the mission to destroy them. Kong had a humanity evidenced by his obsession with Fay Wray which, despite the destruction he caused, did evince sympathy at his demise. We did feel a certain liking for at least some of the ""Jurassic Park"" monsters as well, but Gojira is totally merciless and we cannot agree with the Professor that the creature should be kept alive.However, there are moments in the film which stand alone from the others mentioned. ""Gojira"" underlines the sheer destruction of Tokyo by lingering on the devastation the monster has caused and also the human cost: we see several shots of the wounded being cared for by nursing staff. In one scene, a girl refers to having survived Nagasaki - the Japanese in their post-WW2 world would have been well-acquainted not only with the effects of ""ordinary"" warfare, but also the total devastation of cities like Hiroshima. It is also interesting to see the television pictures of the Japanese schoolgirls singing their hymn for peace in the face of Gojira's violent annihilation of the city, which provides a moment of strong emotion and sadness rare to see in a monster film (it's hard to imagine anything similar in the American remake!).It's easy now to criticise the monster itself for being just ""a man in a suit"", but - stating the obvious - technology has moved on since the 1950's and it has to be said that he does make a very impressive monster. Let's face it - he's far more frightening than his US counterpart of the 1990's, who seems like a comedy figure in comparison.Gojira can hold his own in the monster elite.",positive
"Contains SPOILER!.....As a youngster watching ""Godzilla"" the first time, I remember being terrified and still get chills watching it today. Of course, in America, we saw the re-cut version with added scenes with Raymond Burr so as to appeal to American audiences. While this was all fine, nothing compares to the original, unedited Japanese version. I was so pleased when this version came available in America and it was like watching a whole new movie. The character development is so much deeper and the scenes are in different order which give a whole new look to the film. Obviously computer graphics were still far off so our lead character was a man in a costume but you don't really notice this. The somber black and white photography and fantastic lighting effects make up for any technical deficiencies. Our monster is frightening and cold. You feel for the people caught up in this nightmare as they are also dealing with inner conflicts as well as the disaster around them. To get the full flavor of the story, view the original Japanese version which also is about 10 minutes longer than the American version.SPOILER>>>>>>> Though Godzilla was a destructive creature with only one mission, it's sad at the end when he is 'killed'. The only thing I would have changed would have been the ending where he would have survived all attempts at destruction so that he returned to the sea. All in all, a great monster story!",positive
"""Godzilla"" is the most unlikely of classics. A campy, cheesy, special effects film about a mutated, radio active lizard crushing Tokyo, ""Godzilla"" was quickly viewed by the Japanese viewers as a metaphor to the dangers of the use and testing of nuclear weapons, a problem that Japan knew scarily well after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII.Inspired by ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" ""Godzilla"" would become the definitive figure of giant monster movies, and become one of the biggest pop culture icons in Japanese history. The story is minimal but entertaining and effective. The story is not complicated, and is easy to follow. The special effects, yet campy, were revolutionary during its time. Special effects have gone a long way since 1954, but keeping in mind what audiences were used to seeing during the time period, this was top of the line. The most important thing about this film however is its cultural significance. Giving a powerful statement of the effects of the misuse of nuclear weapons, ""Godzilla"" is a potent reflection of the horrors that happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and to this day still makes this point to newer and newer generations.",positive
"After a Japanese fishing village is ravaged by what everyone thinks is a hurricane, a team of scientists discover that a radioactive monster has been awakened by atomic bomb testing in the pacific. The monster, nicknamed Gojira by the Japanese after a mythical sea god, ravages Japan, while the scientists race to find a way to destroy it.There were two versions of this film released, the original Japanese version, and a version released in America with scenes of Raymond Burr as a visiting American shoehorned in while other scenes with the Japanese cast were omitted. This is the original version, and while the effects seem dated and clunky, and the acting stiff, the images of civilians being burned alive, children dying and cities being toppled and burned to the ground are an all too painful reminder of how Japan was eviscerated at the dawn of the atomic age.",negative
"It's a b/w classic, the first of the series and it does look goofy at times, while still a part of the scenes look well made for 1954. The plot around it offers a nice drama, even if flawed and without giving anything away, I did like the ending. The music and Godzilla's roar stand out. Imagining movie history without Godzilla/Gojira is not possible, it turned into cult.Actors were well chosen, e.g. Takashi Shimura ('Seven Samurai' (1954)), one of the renowned japanese actors of this time.",positive
"For the first half, I found this to just be a slog. Slow and boring, the characters incessantly babble about science, and Godzilla stays mostly distant and covered. However, once the first big destruction scene happens, things ramp up wonderfully. The creature is good, and his roar is even better. The actual story of the central humans becomes more interesting. And the parallels to WWII, while a bit obvious, are surprisingly moving.",positive
"The floodgates of Japanese sci fi and man in suit vs. miniature special effects were largely pioneered in this film. So here we have this film to thank for giving us everything from ATRAGON to DAIMAJIN.Also, more importantly, (for us Americans anyway since it's really the only exposure most of us have to Japanese film) this film gave the world Godzilla. Unlike most of his later films, this is dead serious straight forward horror. The beast is out to maliciously kill people... he doesn't just step on people or knock rubble onto them. No, he actually breaths atomic breath on small groups of people and even EATS a few reporters! This Godzilla as more a force of nature than a character is evil in a way the later incarnations could never hope to be.The film has some excellent acting by Toho pro's including Takashi Shimura playing his usual character, and Akihiko Hirata as a semi-mad but earnest scientist. Throw in a useless love triangle and (for US audiences) Raymond Burr standing around looking at things and there you go.The problem I have with enjoying this one is everything feels so third world when compared with Toho films made only 4-5 years later, over which time their budgets and effects technology grew by leaps and bounds. This movie feels old and looks old, creaking by at a very slow pace and often hard to even see what is going on. Godzilla's appearance is different in almost every shot, as in some he's a hand puppet, others a guy in a suit. I know it's blasphemous but all this is enough to turn me, a hardened fan of Godzilla since age 7 for 20+ years now, off. It's just too crude to really get into and forget you're watching some old movie.The immediate sequel GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN suffers from a lot of the same problems and looks comparatively rushed, but by that point the technology was improving and the pacing starting to pick up.",negative
"""Gojira"" is a very entertaining although rather dated action sci-fi flick with some nice action sequences and pretty good acting from Akihito Hirata and character actor Takashi Shimura (who features in a lot of Kurosawa films like ""Ikiru""). This first Godzilla film would set the standard for the follow ups but to me those never reached the level of this one.The American remake ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" is a stripped down version of the original with lame synchronization and the Emmerich version is good looking, but inert story wise. To me the real competition comes from ""Destroy all Monsters"" and ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" which both feature a lot of monsters and tons of action.This film is to me such a cherished movie because of its dated yet well worked out frenzy when Godzilla crushes the city of Tokyo several times. The ending is not bad and the final thoughts of Dr. Kyohei resemble the American sci-fi movies concerning weapons of mass destruction. If you want to be entertained,this is a good movie to watch although the romantic scenes are a bit slow and don't do the movie much justice,still this is a matter of taste.Great fun. 7/10",positive
"To me, the original Godzilla deserves a 10 just for its message and how it executes it. Godzilla represents our destruction, the film is a warning about nuclear annihilation.For example, the film begins with a group of sailors being killed which is a explicit parallel to the real Lucky Dragon incident where Japanese sailors were contaminated due to test of the first hydrogen bomb. Radiation plays a key part in the film.The film has many more shots and dialogue which are about the devastation nukes can cause. The bombing of Nagasaki is even directly mentioned.Probably the best example is towards the end of the film where a scientist doesn't want to use the ""oxygen destroyer"" due to his fear of others using it. He created a weapon of mass destruction. The dialogue in this scene directly talks about the hydrogen bomb and how we don't need more weapons like that in the world. In the end, the ""oxygen destroyer"" is used however, the scientist takes himself out with it and destroys all of his research.So as you can probably tell, the anti nuke messaging is done very well.In terms of Godzilla itself, this film is from before Godzilla became a protector of Earth in later TOHO movies and it shows. Godzilla in this film is actually scary which is thanks to the message.If I had any criticisms, it would just be some of the special effects however this film is from 1954 and for the time this was very impressive and there is a lot of shots that still hold up. There is probably other issues I have however most of it is just nitpicks.Godzilla is a film I heavily recommend to anyone. I also recommend watching Shin Godzilla as its in a lot of ways a modern take on this film and is even better in my opinion.",positive
"Although not the masterpiece I was expecting, you have to recognize this as a technical achievement for all of film.
The action is pretty good with the destruction scenes being pretty grand and powerful too. I loved the charm of this film though. There are some scenes where you see cars driving down the street and you'll see it cut to miniatures as they'll flip around or explode and it just made me smile. It's pure filmmaking and the rawness of this film made it all the more beautiful.There were some hiccups along the way like some really awkward cuts, some not-great dialogue, and some pretty poor acting in my opinion. I don't think I could even name you a character aside from Serizawa. For the majority of the movie I wasn't too tied in into the story either and found it to drag at points, the plot as a whole didn't really excite me until the 3rd act.But overall, it's a classic and the origins for one of the most iconic Monsters of all time.",negative
This a very good movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It is very scary. Godzilla king of the monsters is better. That is a director's cut of this move. It is very different from this version of it. This is a good movie and if this movie had not been made Godzilla King of the monsters would not have been made. It think the best Godzilla movie is The reboot from 1998. I know most you do not agree with that. That is fine. It is only my opinion. If you get mad about you are a pane so stop it. This a good movie. If you like scary stories you will like this movie. The sixth Godzilla movie The Return of Godzilla is better. the twenty fourth part to the the Japan Godzilla series Godzilla vs Megarus is also better. The twenty fifth part to the Japan Godzilla series Godzilla series Godzilla Mothra and King Ghidorah giant monster all out attack is also better. Still this movie is a must see.,positive
"60 Years ago this year, 2014, Godzilla, original Japanese title, Gojira, was released. Nearly six decades since it first release this film and its entire franchise is still one of the most talked about in movie history. Its villain, or hero at times, Godzilla turned out to be one of the most popular characters ever created, and it all started with this amazing classic.The story of the film is simple, yet very effective. In Japan, a fishing boat mysteriously disappears, and when investigated another ship vanished, which turns out was attacked by Godzilla. Local folklore say that it was Godzilla. He came back because the food in the ocean was no longer available, and that in the past they even sacrificed young women to the giant animal. Godzilla, a dinosaur like creature, is revealed to be unleashed because of nuclear testing that had been going on in the area. Godzilla attacks their town and their cities, and a plan of attack against the giant Godzilla is set in place. The plan is to electrically shock the Godzilla in hopes of finally killing it. However the plan backfires as Godzilla uses his fire breathing to knock over the electrical towers that were in place to stop him. A scientist has a plan to stop Godzilla once and for all, although he is very worried about this plan being used in the future by the military for a world war. The device is meant to take away all oxygen from the water so that everything in it dies off. The plan is a success, but the wise man at the end of the film wonders if there are more of these creatures.For being 60 years old now, and for a film made in the 1950s, it actually doesn't look that bad. Sure this film uses a lot of small scale work for the big action scenes with Godzilla, and while most of us can notice how silly it looks today, back in the 50s this was a popular way of shooting scenes like this. So for its time this is an amazing film. Truly one of the best of its genre that still holds up to this day.",positive
"A piece of art, a masterpiece!Gojira had a budget 10 times that of an average Japanese film at the time, but had a turnabout with 10 million viewers in Japan. It launched a new genre in Japanese cinema, the monster movie. It was quickly exported and remade by Hollywood.Nine years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Gojira is on the one hand a permanent metaphorical warning of nuclear dangers, on other hand an instrument of collective catharsis for the Japanese people.Godzilla's starting point was Eugéne Lourie's 1953 film ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", based on the story by Ray Bradbury, in which a dinosaur is hit by nuclear tests in the Arctic and terrorizes the US. . (film to i see when possible!)
The work, dedication and meticulousness of the special effects make this film one of the references that demonstrates the best that was done at this level in the 50's. And it's a work of art, that scale model of Tokyo, it's even a pity to be destroyed it in the final battle. Also contributing to this art is the fact that the animation technique of, for example, ""King Kong"" was not used, instead being represented by an actor wearing dinosaur clothes. What has become a feature of Japanese cinema. An art when it´s well done as in Gojira, but disastrous when badly done, source of irony and joke of poorly done sequels.I highly recommend it is a masterpiece!",positive
"I vaguely remember the movie making an impression on me when I was a young child. Back then I really felt that Godzilla was an effect of our meddling with atomics and a direct punishment of our ambition for power. Now, though, I only see the lame guy in the rubber suit and ridiculous acting by most involved.What was most striking for me is that it didn't really look like a Japanese film at all. Probably then the Japanese cinematography was something inspired by the American one and it took decades to transform itself into the distinctly different thing that it is now. But at least the feelings and culture expressed in the film I expected to be very Asian; they mostly weren't. One could imagine the same movie in 1954 with American actors, doing the very same scenes (obviously not in Tokyo), and not feeling out of place.There were some really dramatic moments and some real acting, but most of it was mediocre. The story was nice, though. This giant monster starts attacking people and, as was the style of the era, scientists get to save the day, not rough guys in cool machines. There is this biologist who wants to study the monster and gets upset when people want to kill it, but then again he brings no solution to how he was to study it without being killed. Another one is desperate his weapon might be used as a WMD, but he names it so descriptively that any government in the world could redo his research in a heartbeat. There is the young sweetheart, lovely thin Japanese girl, who knows all scientists involved, even if she dates the rough guy (obviously). Other than that, only the actor in the Gojira suit is mentionable, poor guy probably sweated a lot during filming.The effects were interesting for that era. Lot of model work, some of the scenes look really good, while some are ridiculous (check out the one when airplanes attack Godzilla and no matchstick rocket hits). The suit was pretty terrible as well. Surely they could have done better than that.As I was saying, the reactions of the people in the film didn't look very Japanese, all dignified and honorable. There was the transmission tower scene, where a radio operator transmits until Godzilla kills him and all he has to say is he has no time to run, he will die, sayonara, but other than that, pretty Westerner reactions, down to the control room guys dressed in suits and staying somewhere around a table looking all important.One of the big strengths of the movie is the soundtrack. It really adds weight to the story.As a conclusion, I think that for its time it was a decent film, but where I think it failed most is where it should have had the biggest impact: the anti atomic and anti weapon of mass destruction line. Watching the film this second time I didn't feel any emotional reaction for or against terrible power. Indeed, terrible power is the subject of the film and also the solution to the initial problem. It really doesn't instill any desire to stop pursuing it. And of course, having 27 other movies with Godzilla, all worse than this one, doesn't help.",positive
"The surprise hit that spawned the fertile Japanese monster industry isn't nearly as silly and hokey as its offspring might make you think. Sure, the special effects are laughable by today's standards - a passionate love for obvious miniatures really does it in - but the plot is usually more concerned with deeper meaning than cheap action sets. The monster itself, wisely silhouetted or partially obscured after an unintentionally hilarious debut in broad daylight, works as both a sci-fi foil and a potent metaphor for the terrors nuclear war had played on Japan not ten years prior. And the way he's ultimately dealt with leaves the door wide open to questions about mankind's interference in the natural order, the breakneck spread of WMDs and everything in between. It's always bugged me that later films in the series shifted Godzilla's role to friend of humanity and defender of the planet, because there's really nothing to befriend in a 160-foot, fire-breathing, nuclear-powered lizard with a penchant for destructive strolls through the industrial district. For my money, he's never been used more effectively than he is right here, in a cameo role as the nigh-unstoppable force of nature that muscles humanity into making a tough decision. The story moves a bit too slowly at times, with too many major player sharing too many coincidental relationships, but the moral stays true and frankly it's nice to see a movie in this genre that isn't afraid to take its time.",positive
"I have to pay respect to the movie that spawned a giant franchise, but Godzilla is a little tiresome. It's very repetitive and it feels like the humans were in a different movie than the titular titan. However, even though the visual effects are corny, it's impressive how much work they put into the miniatures. I admire what this film created, but it's not one I prefer to watch.",negative
"Before the opening credits scroll in Gojira, we are greeted to a series of Godzilla's thundering footsteps that Composer Akira Ifukube intentionally recorded to mimic the sound of bomb explosions. Godzilla's original bone-chilling roar is then heard as the film's title appears on the screen. Symbolism, allegories, complex plots, a high budget, and innovative special effects are among the many words the casual observer would lastly associate with a Godzilla film. Ironically, that person would find himself wrong when it comes to Gojira, as it contained all of these aspects. Yet this is how Godzilla originally was, and it goes much deeper than the monster itself.To put it bluntly, it is an absolute shame that Gojira (1954) does not receive the much recognition it deserves in today's society. It receives so little that this movie can be considered a ""lost"" Godzilla film in Western culture. This would not be the first time though that Godzilla has undergone ignorant criticism. The first thing that comes upon mind to many when Godzilla is mentioned casually is the stereotype that all Godzilla movies are cheesy and worthless pieces of garbage (or anything along those lines). True, fans can admit that their favorite monster has had several bad moments that have severely undermined his reputation, but almost none of those casual observers are even aware of the masterpiece that Gojira is  heck, there are even some Godzilla fans that are not aware of it as well. One thing that can be said though is that Gojira is by far the best Godzilla film and it is very likely that there will never, ever be another Godzilla film as good as it. If you were made to watch only one Godzilla movie in your lifetime, then Gojira is the one.",positive
"Embracing these Embarrassing Japanese Clunkers is something of a Guilty Pleasure without the Guilt for the Fans of the Franchise.The Original, unlike its Endless Run of Follow Ups is completely stone faced Serious. But aside from a few Scenes of the Big Guy doing his thing, there is Nothing in this that Demands anything but a brief Glancing Curiosity. At no time does Godzilla even remotely Seem Alive. A pitiful Stiff Slow Step and an Unnatural head turn are the best this plodding Rubberized Reptile can maintain. Not ever does the Threat to the Oh-So-Glowing City Manifest itself in any semblance of Despair, except when it Cuts to the Huddling Masses of the Crying Children. But as soon as it returns to Establishing the City, We are aware of a Tinker-Toy-Tokyo. The whole Attack seems to be in Slow Motion and a lot is so Under-Lit as to be a Distraction.This was the Beginning of this Type of Thing and probably should have been the End considering the Buffoonery that followed in those Clunky Suited Monstrosities.Fans of the Series, who have said that this is the Best Monster Film of all time, are either pulling Your leg or They are Delusional.",positive
"Gojira (1954) ** (out of 4) Having seen (and enjoyed) the American version of this, I was really looking forward to seeing this since most fans say this is the best of the bunch and shows the title character in a different light. Yeah right. This thing here, even though it's serious in nature, is just as stupid and plot less as any of the others. The worst thing is that everything leading up to the attack is just downright boring and over-dramatic. The thing is poorly acted, poorly directed and yes, the special effects are even bad. The American footage with Raymond Burr can be called a hack job but it's still better acted and directed than any of the non-Godzilla stuff here.",negative
"It may be awell acted and properly thought out allegory of anti western/anti nuclear horror with some good effects.
It is also, deliciously, a guy in a rubber suit jumping on cardboard houses in a film that spawned one of the greatest franchises of all time.",positive
"It's difficult to remember, but the cuddly Godzilla that emerged in the 70's as monster kids watched the films repeatedly on TV was anything but when he first emerged from the waves and brought the same destruction to Japan that it had endured just one decade before.Director Ishiro Honda completely shot Tokyo rampage with the same terror that came from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, saying ""If Godzilla had been a dinosaur or some other animal, he would have been killed by just one cannonball. But if he were equal to an atomic bomb, we wouldn't know what to do. So, I took the characteristics of an atomic bomb and applied them to Godzilla.""It's also a cultural metaphor for how Godzilla is the victim of the United States - Japan as a whole felt the same way - with the bomb tests that woke him sending the giant dinosaur searching for something and finding only the need to destroy everything. It is filled with bleak and brutal images from a country that was the only one in the world that had to deal with having nuclear hell unleashed upon it.Unlike every movie that ripped off this film and gave birth to the kaiju film, this is not just men in suits ripping up model buildings. This is a film that uses a gigantic beast as a metaphor for trying to start again, for being bombed into oblivion, for dealing with fear and so much more. It's an astounding piece of art that couldn't play that way in our country, leading to Godzilla, King of the Monsters!Director Ishiro Honda - who worked shirtless in blazing heat to make several scenes in this movie come to life, leading to permanent scars on his back from sunburns - felt that no one would respect a science fiction movie, so this needed to be presented as a documentary and the titular creature would only be seen in shadow and never in full frame until late in the film.Dr. Kyohei Yamane wants to save Godzilla, as he's waited his entire life to see a real dinosaur or ancient sea creature or whatever this creature, awakened by nuclear bomb testing, really is. Yet all anyone can do is send more bombs, more bullets and more electronic fences after the creature who shrugs it all off. The hospitals are overflowing with the dead and dying, reminding one of the radiation-scarred cities at the end of World War II.Only Dr. Daisuke Serizawa and his horrifying Oxygen Destroyer - which disintegrates oxygen atoms and causes living things to rot - can really stop Godzilla, but Serizawa realizes that if he uses this weapon, it won't be the last time that it is unleashed. So he reacts exactly like a man who embraces Japanese honor would, even in the face of death. He burns his notes and commits to dying as he faces the monster one-on-one, knowing that all of his work will never fall into the wrong hands.Many thought that this film would flop and it opened to mixed reviews. Critics believed that the movie exploited the nuclear terror Japan had survived as well as the Daigo Fukuryu Maru incident, in which a Japanese fishing boat had been caught in a U. S. nuclear test. It wasn't until American reviews pointed the art in using monsters to deal with real-life horror that the film was considered a success.As for that American movie, Honda wasn't even aware that it had been re-edited until it played Japan as Monster King Godzilla in 1957. We'll get to that on our site soon enough, but it's odd that the kind American reviews that prompted critical reevaluations in Japan were watching a movie that had been sanitized of much of the real-world elements, making it more of a monster movie than a parable.Godzilla is an important film, not just because thirty films plus and a cultural force emerged from it. It demands to be watched and considered, particularly in a world where it seems like we've learned none of its lessons.",positive
"To me, Ishiro Honda is Japan's answer to Ed Wood. It's true, he's not quite as bad as Wood, and his films were actually hugely successful. Still, Honda shows almost no artistic abilities when it comes to film-making  it all moves too slow, half the film is stock footage and the miniatures never look like anything but miniatures  and absolutely no abilities when it comes to writing  every theme the film has is spoken out loud by the film's characters. Even the famous monster looks like total crap  grade school kids could have come up with a less turd-looking dinosaur with a stack of newspapers and a bucket of glue. Much like Wood, Honda loved making movies and really had good intentions while doing it, even though he was largely clueless. I can't believe some people take him seriously as a director. The only really good part of the film is its score, by Akira Ifukube. This original version plods along and is dead serious. The cheesier later Godzilla films are much more fun. I wouldn't say it's a total waste of time, though. It's kind of fun in the same way that Plan 9 from Outer Space is.P.S. Be sure to rate my review as unhelpful because you disagree with it!",positive
"Let me preface this by saying that my personal tastes lean more towards modern day films, and any films that I watch that are older (as in 40s and 50s) I generally rate based on how they would have been seen back then, and not really based on how I enjoy them today. Things such as the way actors performed and the way films were edited back then really take me out of the experience, if i'm being honest. Choppy editing and weird transitions exist a whole lot in films like this, but at the time time I understand why, as I have edited with film and it's not a very fun nor easy process as it is editing on a computer.Godzilla is an impressive film because of it's special effects. It can't be denied that at the time, this would have absolutely blown peoples minds. Now it's harder to get that effect because we have CGI, and all we see is a guy in a costume stomping on miniatures. The story is interesting in theory, but at times can drag a little. Everyone always compliments it for having a commentary about nuclear weapons and such, but I felt that they really only mention it in the beginning, and then tack on a bit of a ""we shouldn't use nukes"" message at the end. It just didn't have the depth that I expected.The reason that I rate this a 7 is, as I said, based on its impact on film. It has inspired many people and films, and spawned tons of sequels and remakes. If I rated this based on my personal taste, it would be lower. But I can certainly appreciate the impact it has made, and I would have loved to have seen it back in 1954 when it was released, just so I could feel that awe that movie goers must have experienced when watching it back then.",positive
"Probably the greatest monster movie or disaster movie I have seen. The horror and disaster showed really hits on a different level considering the actual state of Japan at the time and the imageries being their memory, a catharsis to make it such a movie. The monster that coming out from the depths of the world awakened by the man's hunger for power and the scientist who would die before being part of another genocide. All of this while creating an engaging monster movie that is still used to make brainless monster films in the same brand and in different brands. Gojira is not just a movie and the metaphor is not just simply against nuclear power, or the US, it's about the rise of finding meaning and art and the collective conscious.",positive
"After decades of only knowing about the original Japanese version of the original Godzilla film, I finally got to watch this online. The Japanese-language version with English subtitles was what I saw first on a Facebook link that muted much of the music score for some reason so in the middle of that one I then switched to the same version on Internet Archive which restored the score but kept stopping and starting again constantly. I then watched an awful English-dubbed version on the DailyMotion site. This is not the same as the American-altered version with added Raymond Burr scenes, by the way. That version I'll review later on this site. Anyway, despite the cheezy Godzilla suit and some obvious models used for buildings and cars, this was a compelling take on the effects of Atomic bombs on the Japanese citizenry especially that of a hibernated dinosaur which means this movie might have been inspired by the American picture, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms as well as the rerelease of the original King Kong during this period. I do admit to being disappointed in not seeing Godzilla stepping on or eating some humans or stomping on cars like that Kong and that Beast did in the pictures I just mentioned though it was awesome seeing him stomping and eating some trains and of course, burning buildings with his heat breath! Still, like I said, this was quite thrilling and a little dramatic so on that note, I recommend this original Godzilla or Gojira.",positive
"There is little to be said about this movie because it is the grandfather of many modern monster films, so it follows a similar formula to what many viewers will have seen before.Unlike many new monster films, and even later Godzilla films, this original movie carries a sense of passion that few others in the genre succeed in conveying. Everything from Godzilla's horrific appearance to the then contemporary reason for him existing in Japan comunicates how much effort went into making this film work aesthetically and thematically.Though certainly iconic for the franchise it spawned, and its own value as a movie, I do think the quality of this film is slightly overrated. Like other Godzilla films it lacks an interesting cast and plot because of how other films like this have grown somewhat stale in modern day, due in part to how many later Godzilla films would mimic this film's formula.However, with the exception of the odd shot or iffy special effect, most of the destruction and Godzilla action holds up well and makes the film worth watching. A must see for all G-fans and monster movie lovers, but those who are tired of the formula of this genre, or simply don't like older movies, can give it a pass.",positive
"I got to admit I've seen Godzilla many, many times. But I never seen Gojira until recently and I can tell you that the original version of the film is far different. Of course, being basically the same movie as Godzilla, it suffers many of the same flaws. For one, the close ups of Gojira look like a quickly made hand puppet or Muppet. The CO2 cold for his atomic breath didn't work. Now for Gojira, it is a little slower in the plot department. I think they focused too much on the love story between the girl and the one-eyed scientist. Plus like Godzilla, it dragged on until we got to see Gojira the first time. But on the DVD there is an interesting documentary on the making of Gojira and it was the first of it's kind. The first giant monster movie in Japan, so keeping that in mind. I think they did a bang up job and the movies since then were much better. 7 STARS",positive
"This film is simply beautiful. the special effects are astounding even now. the camera knows where the sweet piece in the movie is and it indulges in it. every scene with Godzilla is brilliant. the end of the first attack, I love it. the acting can be shoddy at times but the camera work and the giant radiation spuing reptile make up for it. Definitely come for the beasts. the humans fill their requirements, but they kind of feel like general archetypes. theirs a character with an eye patch for cryen out loud!would i see it again? yes of course, but only for the monster. Godzilla is a terrifying unstoppable force of pure nuclear symbolism.",positive
"Gojira (Godzilla, 1954) is the first ever Godzilla movie and is available on HBOMax. The storyline follows a nuclear testing experiment that awakens a monster at the bottom of the ocean. After he awakens he begins a path of destruction. If scientists awoke him can they find a way to put him back to rest or kill him? This movie is directed by Ishirô Honda (All Monsters Attack) and stars Takashi Shimura (Ikiru), Akihiko Hirata (Godzilla King of Monsters), Akira Takarada (Mothra vs Godzilla) and Momoko Kôchi (Godzilla vs Destroyah). The sound effects in this from the opening to closing credits are outstanding. The movie starts off and contains a lot scientists gathering and conversations that at times drag but adds depth to the storyline. The movie does a great job of depicting people's reactions and evacuations which are very well done. The special effects were consistently shot in dark settings but were very fun and the models they use are outstanding and so fun to watch with Godzilla and how his arrival impacts them. There's an electric wire scene that is legendary and very well done. Overall this is a movie that gives me a nostalgic happy feeling every time I see it. It's easy to root for Godzilla and feel like ""this is what you get for playing with nuclear weapons."" I even feel a bit sad at the end when the rubber Godzilla sinks back into the ocean. This is a extremely fun movie I'd strongly recommend and score an 7.5-8/10.",positive
"To me it seems quite obvious that ""Gojira"" is not just another monster movie; created in Japan, not a decade after the dropping of Nuclear Bombs on the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, ""Gojira"" serves as an allegory for the suffering of the Japanese people. The scene opens onto a fishing boat that strays to close to a nuclear testing site, reminiscent of the ""Lucky Dragon No. 5"", the blast which sinks the ship also awakens the feared ""Gojira"". ""Gojira"" a feared beast with rock-like skin, likened to the texture of radiation burns, with the ability to shoot radioactive fire from his mouth and whose footsteps leave radioactive fallout in his wake, seems the perfect living depiction of a Nuclear Bomb. The first shot, of that unfortunate ship is believed to be a reminder of the Lucky Dragon No. 5, a ship that when fishing for Tuna, and instead was delivered a heavy dose of radiation from testing done by the U.S Military on Marshall Islands. The ship, well outside the radius was hit with radioactive fallout when the tested atomic bomb was more powerful than the U.S military realized. As with those in the film, who died as the ship sank, the crew of Lucky Dragon No. 5, obtained radiation poisoning and died quickly. This same atomic testing that killed the crew of the ship, is also attributed with awakening ""Gojira"", a menacing beast that attacks Japan in the same manner as that of an atomic bomb. Unlike an atomic bomb, the Japanese in ""Gojira"", find a way to stop the monster, with a fictional ""Oxygen-destroyer"", thought this may seem the typical happy Hollywood ending the fact that ""Gojira"", the allegorical Atomic bomb (and in some sense the U.S military), was destroyed, shows the true feelings of the Japanese people. The Japanese mindset is one that believes, what's done is done, and instead of dwelling in the past, the Japanese should work toward the future, the very fact that ""Gojira"" was so popular, helps the outside world realize that even though the Japanese may not mention it, the atomic bombings are always on their minds.",positive
"Godzilla aka Gojira is without doubt a titan and I would call him King of all monsters of the past, the present and the future. There are many offspring of this destructo mayhem epic monster, some fine, some solid, some pure trash. Anyway, the first appearance of Godzilla is always a good point to start the journey thru the many adventures of this beast and its fellow titans. Exact rate: 7 + 1 for originality.",positive
"Today, with ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" (2021) and the rest of the Monsterverse, we get modern action pacing and CGI, but kaiju used to mean something. Now, subtext extends little beyond the obliviousness of a franchise owned by a Chinese conglomerate (Legendary Pictures being a subsidiary thereof) trampling over Hong Kong, but the giant lizard and ape were once conscious efforts to confront national and world trauma--broadly, colonialist in ""King Kong"" (1933) and nuclear in ""Gojira."" Real issues complicated and processed as monstrous metaphors by filmmakers with artistic vision--not this corporatist fantasy of misunderstood gentle giants at heart wreaking havoc for the supposed good of mankind.This original ""Gojira"" was part of a renewed craze in the early 1950s for monster movies. After ""Mighty Joe Young,"" (1949), ""King Kong"" was re-issued in 1952. Soon thereafter, ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (1953) was released. Indeed, some considered ""Gojira"" a Japanese imitation of the latter stop-motion-animated science fiction--both of them involving prehistoric dinosaurs awakened by nuclear blasts. Shortly before its completion, too, the first of the radioactive big-bug features, ""Them!"" (1954), hit cinemas.In more important ways, ""Gojira"" is something significantly different and besides leading to its own franchise, its eventual heroification of Godzilla and emphasis on an appeal to child audiences, to the point of making the enormous reptile an icon of Japan and its most recognizable export. Unlike the Hollywood creature features, Godzilla came from the country that was the victim of atomic bombings, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that both the United States and Soviet Union had recently performed their first hydrogen bomb tests on either sides of the island nation. Another U. S. H-bomb test contaminated the crew of a Japanese tuna fishing boat--an incident alluded to in the opening scenes here--leading to one member's imminent death, a panic when the tuna entered the market, and protests against America and nuclear weapons. That's the real-world environment--of lingering and continued national trauma, the post-war geopolitical relationship with the U. S., and the place for Japanese scientific and technological pursuits under this danger of being turned into weapons (the ""oxygen destroyer"" with its symbolically atom-splitting-like mechanism)--in which Godzilla was born. How monumentally incompetent then in the recent Monsterverse is the love for the bomb--lighting up humanity's supposed dinosaur pal like a Christmas tree to shoot them tired energy blasts into the sky. Give me a guy in a bug-eyed lizard costume kicking over miniatures and framed in obvious matte compositions any day over that self-aggrandizing corporate and military-industrial-complex tripe of popcorn filler. People mattered then; now, they don'tAs Chon Noriega points out, too, in the excellently titled essay, ""Godzilla and the Japanese Nightmare: When 'Them!' Is U. S.,"" it's important that the film's radioactive dinosaur is named and even supposedly part of Japan's ancient history and mythology as depicted and mentioned in the film, including in song-and-dance even before the creature's face appears on screen. He's not ""othered"" like the American monsters, the so-called ""beasts,"" ""blobs,"" ""its,"" ""pods,"" ""things"" and ""thems"" that displaced any responsibility for the carnage wrought by nuclear weapons and war, cold or otherwise--and even might paradoxically celebrate their militarization, such as in ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms,"" where there are no qualms in weaponizing a radioactive isotope to combat the monster.Yes, the original ""Godzilla"" isn't perfect, narratively or technically. Frankly, it pales some ways in comparison to that American classic where the monster is also named, ""King Kong,"" of two decades prior (but, then, most movies since it pale in comparison even as visual effects have changed). The so-called ""suitmation"" was decidedly a cost and time-saving measure versus the commitment stop-motion animation in the style of Willis O'Brien's work would take--not to mention the greater resources of Hollywood for other effects such as matte painting, rear projection and traveling mattes. In basic conception, however, dressing up actors today for motion capture to be later painted in computers isn't all that different, and, indeed, the 1976 ""King Kong"" Hollywood remake, for one, would adopt similar effects. It also takes a while for the love triangle here to get going, whereas the colonialist filmmakers and sexualized relationship between the giant gorilla and Fay Wray are established early and consistently in ""King Kong."" Nevertheless, in the comparison to the blockbuster garbage of recent years and one of the greatest films ever made from nearly 90 years ago now, ""Gojira"" is far more akin to the latter.Although unlike ""Kong"" and, to an extent, the recent Monsterverse, it doesn't have the monster-as-movie metaphor to go along with the atomic one (although I've since seen that the sequel, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" (1955), does), TV, radio and newspaper reporting are employed within the action as mediating spectators to the monster's menace--mediating not just between the other characters within the film, but also as our surrogate audience within it. In addition to this, the first image of Godzilla is doubly framed as a taken still photograph. Godzilla stomping over and setting ablaze much of Tokyo remains charming today, too, in so far as representing mass urban destruction is charming (and it must be if every other effects blockbuster to this day continues to do it). There's a good rhythm to the editing to avoid shots lingering too long on the blatant fakeness or cheese of the effects (and, reportedly, the time that could be spent in the suit before the actor would pass out also helped in this respect). Most haunting, however, may be the climactic underwater footage. Besides being one way to resolve a love triangle, the diving suits look cool, and the score, as well as the monster's roar, is just very good. Moreover, it's decidedly not a celebration of jingoistic othering or national military and scientific might; if anything, it's a consideration and regret of all that. Time now to revisit the first U. S. cooperation in reimagining this Japanese kaiju in the re-edited, Americanized version of ""Gojira,"" ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" (1956).",positive
"Godzilla directed by Ishiro Honda, was a Japanese made film in 1954, which was a time period following World War two, in this film pay close attention to the effects that this movie brings in. During Godzilla the town is a piece remember to keep in mind that this movie was a few years after World War two ended so this country had just gotten done recovering from the war. However Godzilla brings in a whole new dynamic special effects by bringing in a monstrous animal known is Godzilla who is not only as tall as a skyscraper, but also has the ability to destroy cities within seconds and blow fire to cause even more destruction. Godzilla although is a monster who shows no bounds, they try to find a way to kill this enemy, but only one person has the technology that has to potential to end the life of the great beast and that is the scientist, the scientist shows the girl what it can do. What it is a little marble like object, but once dropped in water it rearranges chemical elements causing any life forms in the water to turn into straight skeleton. As the country draws Godzilla out to the ocean, they drop the CO2 object into the water to finally defeat the beast, at first it does not work, but the scientist gives his life in order to defeat Godzilla. One significant thing about Godzilla is that many say that the reason Godzilla was formed was the nuclear bombs and many new nuclear things that contaminated that water supply, thus transforming an animal into what became Godzilla.",positive
In the country often ridden by natural disasters and then just recently had the nuclear bomb dropped on itself gets another fury released upon them. Because of the nuclear bombs the natural habitat of a dinosaur living in the sea is forced to feed of people instead of what he usually ate and as he has become quite radioactive he cant think very clearly so he decides to go on a rampage stamping on Tokyo and its vicinities and setting it on fire with his/hers radioactive breath. It is of course a comment on the use of nuclear weapons.The models and the monster looks much better than I imagined so if you don't look too closely it is quite realistic. The simple plot works OK. Strangely I felt a bit sorry for Gojira-san by the end. Watch this over the American version which drops the nuclear commentary.,positive
"A really, really weird anti-war movie. However, the cinematography and special effects were highly innovative for its time and the film stands as a classic in the history of cinema and remains the major vein from the American moviegoing audiences to Japanese cinema.",positive
"""Godzilla"" isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Everybody knows the monster is played by a guy in a suit and the city it destroys are miniatures it stomps around in. This doesn't sound impressive to view, but the movie is well enough made that you're not really aware of that. It's also a lot better shot than I expected, and with better actors: Kurosawa's favourite stand-by, Takashi Shimuzu, makes an appearance, and who could forget him from ""Ikiru""?Where the movie falls down is the human story it tells. I was just never that interested in its characters. I kept waiting for the monster to show up, which he surprisingly doesn't do that often. The filmmakers were right, I guess, to limit our exposure to him: it builds suspense and makes his appearances on screen more impactful. But the bits in between his appearances just did not sustain my interest.",positive
This launched entire subgenre of giant monsters wrecking cities. Most of these films are quite silly popcorn flicks. Later films in this series are legendarily bad. This film however is still a good monster film and a good allegory for the national psyche working out the horrors of needless atomic bombings.While one can dwell on the allegory or subtext I prefer to just take this as a giant monster film. The story is straightforward and no bogged down in pointless mythos. The human characters never are annoying or get in the way of the kaiju action. Indeed I wish later kaiju flicks handled their human characters like this film does.But it is the production values and visuals that make this such an enjoyable experience. Suitmation is a wonderful distinctive technique. It sells the scale of the kaiju without the jerkiness of stop-motion or the artificial sleekness of CGI. The director does a good job of teasing what Godzilla looks like for most of the film. The sequence where you first see Godzilla's head is the best of the film because of the restraint of the director.,positive
"The Japanese original that kicked off the longest (in terms of films) running franchise ever, this is a monster movie but it's a bit more than that. The legendary monster is actually a metaphor for the destruction of nuclear weapons and therefore the film offers some sobering post war commentary. While the subsequent Godzilla films sound utterly ridiculous, this one is more serious. Overall, this original is more an important film than an amazing one. It's certainly not a great movie. The human characters are cardboard and very dull; the finale is laughably underdone. At the end of the day when all's said and done, it's just a guy in a rubber suit knocking over a bunch of toy skyscrapers. To be fair, they manage to make this scary, but that's still all there is. The human drama in the movie is dramatically listless and the film fails to connect on an emotional level as a result.Despite these shortcomings, this may be the best B movie of all time. The disaster sequences are very good for the budget and there is a sense of fear and awe. Unlike most of its kind Godzilla is actually fairly sad and ultimately rather haunting. It certainly delivers on providing monster mayhem, as the disaster sequences are certainly effective and have a retro charm to them. Godzilla is an enjoyable and interesting movie with plenty of flaws which prevent it from being the great movie many describe it as, but it is solid fun with a side of melancholy. The film loses some momentum after the big attack on Tokyo, which is a very impressive set piece. At times the film is documentary like and this is when it really hits its stride. To sum up, a good if overrated movie and well worth seeing for fans of monster movies. I prefer the new version but this one's more interesting.7/10",positive
"Not entertaining. Basically, Godzilla rises from the deep as a result of nuclear radiation and attacks tokyo. From an influence standpoint, I can see how this movie is a cultural watershed; I'm sure the special effects were incredible back in it's day, and that proved the main draw of the movie. The problem is that they haven't aged well. They're just not believable having seen modern movies. Normally that isn't a problem for me - most of my favorite movies are old. The problem this movie suffers is a problem I think most giant monster movies suffer from; the characters. The big draw of giant monster movies in the giant monster, but once we see the giant monster, it loses its horror/shock value. At that point the movie needs good, relatable, emotional characters to keep me invested. Like most giant monster movies, this movie doesn't have hardly any character focus. I could remember the old scientist character because he's played by Takashi Shimura, but the others are all forgettable, and the result is that, after godzilla shows up and does his think in the first half, I lose interest. The army, military/planning scenes don't matter to me at all; all I want to see is how godzilla affects the main characters, and how they change, and the movie just doesn't deliver. Not my favorite genre.",negative

"The best horror or monster films as of late are the ones with some sort of meaning, be they political or social. I say this mostly because those particular films tend to resonate more for me. Maybe it's my affinity for history or my addiction to the news but if those films carry a theme that is universal and yet depict a culture specific issue I tend to connect with those more. In the case of Gojira (the original Japanese without Raymond Burr) we get a post World War 2 Japan and more importantly a post Hiroshima, Nagasaki Japan whose trauma is represented in the form of a mysterious monster. It turns out that this monster has been around for generations and revered by locals through traditional sacrifice rituals which with time have been mostly forgotten and have been diluted into a simple dance. Is this another way of saying that the modern post war Japan has forgotten its identity? Or is Gojira a representation of Japan, the Empire now transformed into a post nuclear holocaust. It may seem like I'm really pushing it in terms of film theory especially since most people will flock to this film simply to watch Godzilla destroy Japan. However, the film does not hide from its supposed underlying message as posed by a monologue at the end of the film about Nuclear testing. Regardless, I enjoyed the film just as much for its rubber suit wearing actor who gets to trash toy houses and toy vehicles. Although I wish the night scenes weren't so dark.",positive
"Here in American, we first became aware of Godzilla in the 1956 movie ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" But the original version of this movie was ""Gojira,"" released in Japan in 1954 and directed by Ishirô Honda. Footage from this movie was used in combination with scenes directed by Terry Morse, which included Raymond Burr as Steve Martin, a reporter. With Martin's narration and some dubbing added in, the subtitles used in ""Gojira"" were unnecessary.Although the addition of scenes with Raymond Burr might seem a little cheesy, the Morse version is actually an improvement over Honda's original, and not simply because it eliminates the nuisance of having to read subtitles. Notwithstanding the additional scenes with Burr, ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" runs only 80 minutes, whereas ""Gojira"" runs for 96 minutes, from which it follows that a lot of footage was eliminated from the latter in producing the former. This is not something to regret. The result is that whereas ""Gojira"" drags on at a slow pace, ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" moves at a nice clip. Finally, ""Gojira"" tells its story from beginning to end, whereas ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" begins in medias res, with Steve Martin trying to crawl his way out of the rubble of a destroyed city, who then tells us how things came to be through a flashback. It is this narrative structure that allows for much of the boring material from the original to be summed up by Martin in a few words.I didn't expect to review these movies. My favorite film critic is Danny Peary, who included ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" in his ""Cult Movies 2,"" and so I figured he had probably said it all. However, after seeing both movies back to back, it is clear that on a couple of points he is mistaken. Peary discusses the many ways in which ""Gojira"" is a kind of metaphor and commentary on the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in 1945. However, he suggests that in making ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" some of this was eliminated:""The American version makes two deletions that arouse suspicions regarding the covering up of references to damage done by the A-Bomb; a young woman (Emiko?) says that she doesn't want to be a victim of 'Gojira,' 'not after what I went through in Nagasaki'; a doctor detects that a little girl has radiation poisoning, and though she is sitting up now, he indicates she is doomed.""The first scene involving a woman, who is not Emiko, by the way, does not say anything about Nagasaki. She is talking to a couple of men about the possibility of Godzilla coming to their city. Reference is made to the radioactive tuna and fallout stemming from the fact that Godzilla himself is very radioactive, and they talk about finding a shelter if Godzilla actually comes to the city, the reference presumably being to air-raid shelters. Now, air-raid shelters were commonly used during World War II to protect people from conventional weapons, so there is no clear reference to the atomic bomb in what they say. Of course, I am only going by the subtitles. But their words in Japanese do not include anything that sounds like ""Nagasaki."" On the other hand, if we really want to get all conspiratorial, perhaps the woman's remark about Nagasaki was cut out or there was dubbing in the Japanese language to make reference to shelters instead. But enough of this. In all likelihood, Peary was wrong about what this woman said.As for the second scene, the one involving the doctor who indicates that the little girl is doomed by radiation poisoning, this was not eliminated in Morse's American version. But it occurs much earlier in the movie, owing to the flashback narrative structure, whereas in the original, it takes place much later. This may be what led Peary to think it had been cut out.I remember seeing a bunch of Japanese monster movies at the Triple Threat Drive-In a long time ago. Binge-watching them like this makes you suspect that if you live in Japan, you can expect Godzilla or some other monster to be heading for Tokyo every other Tuesday. My friends and I began to notice that Godzilla started protecting Japan from other monsters. Peary also noticed this, saying that Godzilla had become a Japanese folk hero during the 1960s. But maybe Godzilla was just being territorial.Needless to say, some of these Japanese monster movies are better than others. As we used to say in those days when we went to see them at the drive-in, ""You pays your money, and you Tokyo chances.""",negative
"I think this is total spectacle, just a little shmaltz with the whole aftermath destruction of people in hospitals or kids singing (?), otherwise good buildup in the movie of 'zilla preempting his appearance with good hoolabaloo of the whole metropolitan parts, the destruction is satisfying.",negative
"We watched the original Japanese Godzilla film made in 1954. I thought it was pretty entertaining. Compared to present day special effects the scenes with Godzilla wreaking havoc seem pretty cheesy. Although at the time of its release I'm sure they were impressive. I wish they could have figured out a way to make his fire breathing more realistic looking. It looked like he blew steam on things and then they would suddenly combust into raging fires. One of those scenes I did like and I think the filmmakers knew had made a good looking shot because it was extended for quite a while. It was during the attack on Tokyo after Godzilla has made his initial breakthrough at the coast and inflicted tons of damage in his path. It is a very long shot. Intact buildings are in the foreground. Seemingly small from a distance Godzilla looms over the buildings in front of him while behind him there is a ""sea of flames"" as they reporters say in the movie. The other thing I liked about the movie was the plot and explanation of how Godzilla came to be and why is it now that this million year old specie emerges. Previously the only Godzilla movie I had seen was the American made 1998 version with Matthew Broderick. If I remember correctly that movie did not offer any scientific explanation for why or how Godzilla came to be. In the original much of the content early in the movie was devoted to scientific research and explanation which to me seemed to make the whole scenario at least somewhat plausible. Anytime you can add believability to a story, it creates a more realistic and involved experience for the audience. In the case of the original Godzilla I would consider the movie to be less of a monster movie and more of a sci-fi movie. In sci-fi movies a plot that is credible has a more profound impact on the audience.",negative
"Gojiro, the original Godzilla film of the 1950's, is a creative film for its time and has an interesting background that contributed to the storyline and appeal of the film. Being someone who was unfamiliar with the original version, the only knowledge I had before seeing this film was of the later remakes of the film (made in America). Gojira is definitely not what I expected and that is a good thing. It is more serious than the American version and after learning a little bit about the films historical context, I found that I was able to appreciate it more. The film was released in 1954 which was less than a decade after World War II. The United States ended the war after dropping the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. Throughout that time the United States also spent a lot of time and energy on hydrogen bomb testing. Japan was greatly affected by both of these events and the film really captures a lot about it. Gojira is a monster that lived in the ocean and is awakened because of radiation due to hydrogen bomb testing and brings horror to the cities of Japan. The monster first terrorizes people who are on boats in the ocean but then it finally reveals itself emerging from the ocean. Gojira attacks the cities with radioactive/fire breathing powers and basically destroys everything it comes in contact with. However, Gojira is not just about a monster that destroys cities, but also focuses on the characters of the film and the relationships they hold with one another. This original film gives the audience a real message and analogies that tie to the historical context which is something that the film analysis Gojira vs. Godzilla – Catastrophic Allegories by Aaron Kerner goes into more detail with. Gojira really gives the audience something that cannot be matched with any later versions that attempt to remake this film.",negative

"Due to the historical background that Japan has suffered the atomic bomb catastrophes, Godzilla has a more serious outlook than the US counterpart in the 50s, the drive-in monster flicks. The godzilla's attack on Tokyo is a direct reflection of the bombing during the WWII. Several serious thoughts presented include the following: denouncement for the atomic and H-bombs, suggestion for coexisting instead of eliminating disastrous creatures, and separation of science and politics, as the scientist who invented the ultimate weapon ""oxygen destroyer"" buries his study and himself so that the power can never use it. The filmmakers' sincere passion to carry these messages is clearly sealed in a decent-size production.",negative
"There is a reason why so many film historians and critics say this is the second greatest movie, after the Seven Samurai (1954), to come out of Japan, especially in the 1950s. Being a happy member of the Japanese Kaiju (Monster), Nerd Club, it is always great to go back to 1956 and watch the movie that started it all, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (1956). But, wait a minute! It's not 1956. It's 1954! The year that Gojira actually made his screen debut. The complete original Japanese version of Godzilla, the real version, is the best to see. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (1956), was always fun to watch, because it was always great seeing Raymond Burr, as that wild and crazy reporter, Steve Martin.What you actually get here is the movie the way it was seen in its original form, in its original language, in its original meaning. The scenes are so much more powerful, believable and acceptable, when you watch it, with the subtitles and see all the things that the US distributors cut out of it. It opens a whole new door for you and helps you like this movie even more. The terrors of tampering with the horrors of the nuclear age, all come to the forefront and teach us a lesson, that may have been lost. All the greats, who made Gojira a legend are here. Honda, Tsuburaya and Ifikube, along with a cast, that you will see time and time again, throughout Kaiju movie history. The film also features Takashi Shimura, the leader of the Seven Samurai (1954). It is this film, that the Kaiju film industry was built off of. The one they are thankful for... and so are we.8.6 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",positive
"""Gojira"", the original Japanese Godzilla film is surprisingly good. The monster special effects are obviously dated, but they're good enough. And the plot moves along nicely with some decent characterizations drawn. But it is the messaging which is especially poignant. The movie is almost a plea from war torn Japan to stop the destruction. Only Japan has thus far experienced the aftermath of nuclear bombings and in 1954 those effects were still real and fresh. And the film also references the continued nuclear testing done thereafter. The amount of sickness and cancer caused globally by nuclear testing and weapons is impossible to quantify but it's certainly a real outcome of radiation exposure.I understand that WW2 was a fight to the death with no holds barred and that the Imperial Japanese military was unrelenting and tenacious and that much of Japan was already bombed by the USA, but I still believe the dropping of the two atomic bombs on civilian targets instantly killing 200,000 people to be a war crime by the Democratic president Harry S. Truman. Of course he maintained that such action saved lives, but that is what war-mongers always say. Killing = saving. The reality is that it's impossible to say what would have occurred as there is no way to know. It still saddens me that politicians and generals still push countries to conflict, escalation, aggression, and stockpiling of weapons. Much harm has been done in this world in the name of national security. ""Godzilla"" speaks against this, and the weaponization of science and technology.So, ""Godzilla"" is an affecting film and it got me thinking about my own grandfather who was in the US Army's 313th bomb wing on Tinian Island in WW2 charting bombing runs over Japan, and to which the 509th was assigned which dropped the two atomic bombs on Japan. It's just all so absurd, sending young men halfway around the world to fight other young men whose lives and cultures are virtually untethered and irrelevant to one another. But due to the democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt's desire to cause a world war and the 1940-1941 scrap metal, jet fuel, and oil embargoes on Japan that is the situation which occurred. And FDR lost any moral high ground he had when he turned away whole boats of Jewish asylum seekers in 1939.But perhaps the ruthless dropping of the atom bombs and Truman's willingness to obliterate civilian populations did end the war promptly and secure peace and US hegemony for the subsequent seven decades; however, the world has not yet felt the full brunt of nuclear technology, and its impact cannot be fully assessed and understood until after the next inevitable full-scale war which will surely make use of such devastating technology. Will anything be left afterward to salvage and rebuild upon? Will drinking water sources be poisoned? Will the already damaged ozone layer survive? Will the plankton stay alive; will crops grow? Will radiation cause numerous cancers, animal deaths, etc. Or will it be less worse than feared? The success and sustainability of the current economic, cultural, and military paradigm and regime can only be understood and measured in hindsight. For after all, even if it was all grand and spectacular for a time, like Rome, if it destroys itself and risks the entire web of life and species at its demise, is that really a paradigm to be proud of and to label a success? But alas, success is measured in a brief human lifespan of 70-80 years because who cares about after you're dead, right? And now 77 years from WW2 most persons who experienced that horror are dead or soon to be; then the current crop of ineffectual and short-sighted world leaders can exploit and maim their populations once again with the novel ravages of war.In summary, ""Godzilla"" the Japanese film I rate 7/10; it's not bad, still watchable. And one can't help but view that monster as the embodiment and manifestation of humanity's ills, blowback from nature trying to chastise or correct course.",positive
"Despite being a more than 50 year old movie and in black and white, this still entertains. The film that started the long Godzilla-series just have to be a classic. It's a really dark movie about a prehistoric, dinosaur-like creature (or more correctly, a more than 50 meters tall monster) that emerges from the sea outside Japan and unleashed his terror and horror. The highlight in the movie is when he trashes parts of Tokyo. These scenes are well made considering this movie being so old. Apart from this, the film also has a rather good story. This makes the whole movie more interesting. Conclusion: 6 out of 10.",negative
"I'm sure most moviegoers know this story. H-bomb tests off the Japanese coast drive Godzilla, a survivor from the dinosaur era, out of his underwater lair and into conflict with the Japanese. High-minded monster movie clearly intended to dramatize the horrors of nuclear war. Interestingly, the ""Godzilla problem"" is caused by nuclear testing, Godzilla himself is a kind of embodiment of nuclear devastation (he's radioactive, for example), and the only thing that can stop him is a superweapon the inventor of which fears will be the next ""h-bomb"". High-minded it is, but it's also pretty dull. The first half of the movie is sober and serious-minded and also quite slow, with only glimpses of the monster. We do finally get a look at him during his attack on Tokyo -- and maybe it was better that we didn't. Even if you make allowances for the low budget and the era this sequence is pretty shoddy, with shots that clearly show Godzilla is a man in a rubber suit crushing minatures. The big conclusion is murkily shot, badly scored, and misses the drama inherent in the situation. Certainly an historically important movie, and intellectually engaging -- but that doesn't mean it's good. Godzilla embodies one of the great truths of movies (and storytelling more generally), which is that high-mindedness isn't the same thing as quality. Not recommended.",negative
"As a pop culture junky, I would be remissed to not have scene this movie that had such a great impact on American culture as one of the first majorly successful crossovers from Japan to the United States. However, the importance of this piece's impact on Japanese culture is lost in the translation. It is quite interesting to view the original version of this movie. It allowed me to pick up on a lot of the cues that made the movie impactive. The most important concept that I feel was lost is the fear of the something that comes from the Ocean. When the foreignness of the ocean collides with land, we see the disaster that can even be evokes parallel's of the Tsunami that has recently occurred. Such untampered, senseless and foreign destruction unleashed on a country is something that American's have not dealt with, but which the Japanese have dealt with plenty from conflict with china to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The ocean implies an uncertainty. When Godzilla lands everybody's greatest fear is realized. The unknown has risen. Additional commentary can be made about the effects of war and destruction. Even as Japan prevails over Godzilla, the victory leaves behind a path of destruction that lasts much longer than fleeting feelings of victory. The parallel to war is apparent.The final scene brings up another interesting point that makes us cognizant of the parallel between the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The doctor, points out at the end of the film, that the continued development of nuclear weapons could easily bring the return of Godzilla.. a mutant who was believed to be created by the cause of these weapons. The message is clear. Weapons that bring about destruction are probably not the best way to ensure peace.",negative
"I thought this was going to be a schlocky monster movie, but I couldn't have been more wrong.Created nine years after the atomic-bomb devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this film offers sensitive commentary on the dangers of technology unleashed.When hydrogen-bomb testing rouses a radiation-breathing survivor of the Jurassic Age from the ocean depths, mankind's customary defenses are useless. Nothing from electrification to bombers does a bit of good, as, with earth-shattering footfalls, Godzilla lays waste to everything it touches and sets Japan afire.There is a gripping human story here, as we observe Emiko (Momoko Kochi), daughter of idealistic researcher Yamane (Takashi Shimura), and her lover Ogata (Akira Takarada) urge principled scientist Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) to use his invention to save the world. He fears that weak politicians will put his brainchild to nefarious use (""If only I never invented it""). One can't help but think of the nuclear bomb itself in these desperate negotiations.The film drives home the human toll of war, as a doomed mother prepares to rejoin her war-dead spouse and shell-shocked schoolgirls offer a hymn for deliverance: ""O peace, o light, hasten back to us."" Indeed, prayer has become the final refuge.From its first frames, the movie makes powerful use of music, as a discordant score conjures Man's desperately vulnerable position. This contrasts with the sweet strains of a tanker crew's strumming in the moments before disaster breaks out.When will we wake up?",positive
"possible SPOILER? (i dunno...i just want to cover my bases) all the important aspects of this movie have already been stated.  but a couple of things that i do want to bring up (and i hope i am translating what i heard correctly).i heard from two different sources (one a professor specializing in Japanese cinema and another a Japanese friend) state that the love triangle is more significant than just a filler for a movie.  the two opposing sides (kill the monster and save the monster/save humanity via not using the oxygen destroyer) are actually portraited in the love triangle (Ogata and Dr. Serizawa respectively).  however, there is also a portayal of the two men's indecision and the need for the woman to make the final decision.  during the scene where Serizawa and Ogata are fighting in the lab, there is a wonderful shot of the two men with a ""void"" (representing the indecision on what to do about ""Gojira"") between them...and Emiko simple fills the void and makes the decision (to use the oxygen destroyer to kill ""Gojira""). this type of depiction [filling of a void, usually by a female character] is not uncommon in Japanese film.also, about the earlier note on the slow development of the movie...this is common not only in movies, but novels as well.  Japanese tend to take a long time to get to the point and therefore their movies and novels can seem to drag on.i am not a film student...this is just my opinion based on what i've seen and the people i've spoken with (concerning ""Gojira"").",negative
"You cant ignore the importance this movie has had in the world of film. It will always be remembered as one of the first, biggest, and longest monster franchises ever. Looking at it now its hard not to just enjoy it for how bad the effects are but also how clever they had to be to pull them off with their limited resources. The movie achieves a sense of charm due to its age. Also notable is the social commentary the movie has on things like atomic bombs and radiation. Its a good insight into an important time in history. Although I did like Godzilla quite a bit I still think I enjoyed king kong more. Gojira is a classic and fun look back in time.",positive
"Sure this movie is a classic one.But what is left from this classic today? Today it is just interesting for young kids. The big bad Gojira stalking around like a Zombie on sleeping pills. Seeing how the plastic costume folds during walking is just funny. Thinking about how this monster would starve because it is too slow to catch anything...priceless. The clearly visible toy cars, tanks.... OMG.Still, there are those classic movies that you could watch several times....and Gojira isn't one of them.",negative

Watch for Gojira's flabby skin covering......needs more gym time. Watch for the great interspersed real fire engines with cuts to miniatures with glued on figures. All in all, this is a fake movie, but exactly the kind of movie back then that scared the daylights out of me at the neighborhood theater. We went with 50 cents to cover the 35 cent admission with enough left over for popcorn and a pop from a vending matching. Not a great movie, but so fun to watch.",negative
"It's the 1950s, off Japan's Pacific coast. An angry behemoth, part sauropod, part dragon, rises from the ocean, awakened by atomic waves, first making maritime mayham, then taking to terra firma to terrorize Tokyo and ""10,000 fleeing Japanese (Co-STAN-za!).""One of the more durable monster themes, due in part to it's chameleon-like ability to change with the commercial climate, Godzilla is born from the post-War pessimism of its co-creators Ishiro Honda (D) and Yuko Tanaka (P) (Murata Kayama) (Morse US). Opening ornery, Gojira would evolve in the Showa period (54-75), turning familial, becoming allied, embracing the anti-hero state (King-Kong) and, at times, even exuding charm, but then de-volving on arrival of CGI technology (90s+) when the bellowing beast became a whole different animal. Give me a lumbering kaiju over a sleek reptilian, anyday.The originals (54/56) are best appreciated by Classic fans, but even CGI savants can find value beyond quaint, for the first runs lay the franchise foundation and horrify with a human touch like no computer can. PC promoters will steer you to the all-Japanese version (54), but don't you believe it, King is the better watch. Reason: baritone Ray Burr. Typically cast a creep in early career, and very good at it, but here is spliced-in as a likeable lead, US newsman Steve Martin, on the scene to report the incredible events to a world shocked. Burr turns a new leaf in Godzilla, bagging his bad boy bit and acting a ray of hope to give us our first look at his Perry Mason persona. Having a Yank on board was a small stroke of genius by USA producers. Not only was Steve a touchstone for an American pubic not yet too familiar with Japanese culture, excepting the explosion of 'Made in Japan' merchandise & wartime propoganda films, but with an Allied presence at Godzilla ground-zero, the atomic metaphor Toho studio sought to sell reached a more receptive audience, paving the way for the melancholy monster to come.Why this strange creature Godzilla, anyway? Maker's lingering guilt over its former Axis ambitions which spurred the atomic age, an ironic resentment on the hells of war, real concern over the planet's future or maybe just because monster movies are fun and a diversion from the day-to-day drudgery of rebuilding a nation (3/4).",positive
"Godzilla films have had a bad reputation for years,the most common criticisms being bad dubbing {which was not the fault of the original filmmaker}],poor special effects {which are actually pretty good considering the tiny budgets use}and unintentional campiness {actually they were usually intentionally campy}. This reputation improved a little bit when the atrocious US Godzilla film came out,both an insult to Godzilla fans and an astonishingly inept,shoddy movie in it's own right. However,these films art still underrated. The Godzilla series is like the James Bond series ,quite formulaic,the fun coming from seeing how the filmmakers vary the formula. Some are poor but all are fun,however the very first Godzilla is quite simply a masterpiece,and is actually not campy at all.The film was made partially as an allegory about the dropping of the atomic bomb,and therefore the film has a dark,brooding quality which may come as a shock to viewers used to Godzilla Vs The Smog Monster or Destroy All Monsters. Most of Godzilla's scenes are at night,which helps make the monster about as convincing as a man in a rubber suit could ever be. The effects are very good considering the budget and the age of the film,and the lengthy sequence of Godzilla destroying most of Tokyo is still superb both technically and artistically,with a genuine sense of dread. Of course in this film the human characters are given as much importance,and even the obligatory love triangle ends up being an important part of the plot. There is perhaps a bit too much footage given to people debating about Godzilla and the pace is slow at times,but it's astonishing how much care and intelligence was taken with the film. Akira Ifikube's score is extremely effective partly because it is so restrained.It is common knowledge that when the film was released in America in 1956 that footage of Raymond Burr as a reporter was added. Much of this looks clumsy now-it's obvious he's not part of the original film-but some of the fatalisic,brooding feel of the original version was kept despite having a great deal of Japanese footage cut including some of the more obvious nuclear bomb references. It must be admitted that the alterations may have been instrumental in the film becoming a success in the West {it was probably the first Asian film to get a reasonably wide,non-art-house type release},but the original version is the one to see if possible.This should become easier as there is a proposed US cinema release which will undoubtedly be followed by a DVD release.Maybe than this great film,a monster movie every bit as good as the 1933 King Kong,will finally get the widespread acclaim it deserves.",negative
"I only watch movies for two reasons: (1) entertain me, (2) enlighten me. So let's find out if GOJIRA (1954) did either.ENTERTAINING: This is quite the serious film, so there are no laughs, not even unintentional laughs, unless you are cynical about rubber monster suits and miniature tanks, which I am not. As a matter of fact, Godzilla is a mix of man-in-suit and stop-motion, giving it that Ray Harryhausen (BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS) or Willis O'Brien (KING KONG 1933) appeal. From that aspect, this is awe-inspiring. I should say, however, that stop-motion fire-breathing Godzilla here reminds me of a Rottweiler, which is completely the wrong impression for what this serious film is trying to deliver. Godzilla causes mass destruction here, not randomly (like BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, 1953) but more deliberately (think WAR OF THE WORLDS, 1953), which on its own is extremely entertaining, a guilty pleasure. The Oxygen Destroyer part of the plot is among the best of sci-fi techniques, both logically explained and handily displayed. The love triangle subplot between Emiko and Serizawa is handled tastefully, and I think some may have missed that Serizawa decides to stay down with the Oxygen Destroyer not only out of duty and courage, and to take his secrets with him, but also because he has lost Emiko. Maybe I'm wrong but it adds if it's true, and doesn't subtract if it's not true. There is hardly a scene not entertaining. The trawler and the council meeting scenes are also classic. The film never drags, and there are no scenes which you want to fast forward. I'd have to say GOJIRA (1954) is 10 out of 10 entertaining.ENLIGHTENING: Most movies about monsters born on Earth have a message. KING KONG is pretty racial, JURASSIC PARK is about temperance and moderation for scientists, and GODZILLA is about the consequences of radioactive fallout, with a cross-current of self-hostility towards a post-war Japan that lost World War II. That's pretty heavy stuff. I think we can all agree that Godzilla as spawn of the H-bomb is well-done. He is prehistoric, which reflects fearsome, and he exhales the fire that made him. We also learn in later films that he is basically indestructible, even if destroyed, because somehow he keeps coming back (yes, I know for cinematic money, but still). In fact, the Netflix anime series makes the claim that he is perhaps immortal as well. He is ""atomic"" in every sense of the word. In 1954, we didn't know all that about Godzilla, yet the later claims were based on very strong foundational assertions made in GOJIRA (1954). Another item of interest here is Japan itself, a nation of bustling industry just 9 years after the war has ended, but still primitive in some places, almost a cultural resistance against ""getting back to normal."" There is suspicion between the city folk of Tokyo and the country folk of the islands, who tend to be very superstitious. Not coincidentally, the more primitive citizens know the truth before the more sophisticated find out. This undercurrent sets up a great feel for this or any movie, ""us against them."" It's not fully played out here, because as soon as the monster makes an appearance the scientists decide to name him ""Godzilla"" after the tradition of the islanders. I like this quite a lot. It removes any potential arrogance which many movies linger on, taking the side of the underdog for too long, or focusing on the iniquities of the sinful for too long. When we watch GOJIRA (1954), we get it. People just want to party until the big guy shows up, and that's neither good nor bad, even if some say it's detrimental to a nation. In this film, that hedonism is briefly shown but brightly lit, a beacon for Godzilla to attack. This theme would recur in later Japanese films, most memorably GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER (1971), which makes social comment on the psychedelic 60's as a double-edged sword, on one hand enlightening towards pollution and other important subjects, on the other hand merely leading to the fun of drugs, sex, and rock and roll. Like I said, heavy stuff. The good news is, you don't have to think too much to love GOJIRA (1954), but if you so desire, all the elements are there for thought provocation.I give GOJIRA (1954) a 10 out of 10. It present a top-notch monster of incredible proportions, strengths, and attitude. Godzilla here is classic, and if another Godzilla film had never been made it would have been enough. It is a complete story, with a logical beginning, an engrossing middle, and a jaw-dropping ending. Repeat viewings hardly diminish its power. It has some genuine pathos, believable heroics, and likable characters. The story is clean, and all subplots are sewn tight. The special effects are suitable for the time period, and actually endure to this day, whether out of nostalgia for the past or respect for the craft. Go watch it now.",positive
"A classic film for all the wrong reasons, Gojira was picked up by American studios who stripped the film of much of it's original meaning by adding in cheesy and over-the-top dubbing and an American reporter who somehow slipped into a few scenes, just to make it palatable for a Western audience. The original stands as an excellent film, though. There are clear references to using atomic warfare and the dangers and pitfalls of too much power. When the film is read as a critique of western actions during WWII, the whole meaning shifts, and the film almost feels like a European art film, presenting an excellent social explication in a form that viewers of all ages could swallow.Even when read in the most shallow of interpretations, the film is excellent, showing incites into the beginnings of the entire sci-fy film genre.An excellent film, and a must watch.",positive
"I came here because I heard they rebuild real parts of Tokyo as a MODEL and it is mostly accurate - and they did a lot of double exposure and matte painting with analoge film as well.This film is the ""father"" of monster-horror films, a threat opposed by a supernatural creature, just here to destroy mankind. I did not know that the film was originally Japanese - I enjoyed the (over the top, but fitting for its time) acting, the actual action suit of the monster (trivia: the first one was too heavy to wear!), the ""death rays"", the fire coming from its mouth - radioactive horror that still resonate today in cinematic experiences.Imagine what these images did to the audience nearly 70 years ago!!!A need to watch if you want to experience a milestone of horror-culture with some serious vintage vibes.",positive
"I was actually pretty excited that we had the opportunity to watch the original Godzilla in my Film class. I found the special effects to be kind of corny and humorous. I can't really talk about the special effects though because I am so used to seeing extreme technological breakthroughs in film that it would be unfair for me to say that the effects looked cheap. Ishiro Honda's film ranges from drama to suspense. He established the long series of science fiction movies that were soon to come. Gojira's dark and tragic tone throughout the film kept me interested. The love triangle adds the perfect touch to this monster film. The characters did a great job at portraying emotional pain. Ishiro Honda does a fantastic job at illustrating the protest against nuclear weapons. Godzilla symbolizes man's ignorance and carelessness very well. Gojira parallels events that occurred during this time. Godzilla himself looked rather ridiculous I must say, but I do think Ishiro Honda did a great job at creating a truly grotesque monster. I think that the modern Godzilla monsters don't look as raw and creepy anymore. I couldn't really take the monster seriously when he was stomping through streets, but then again I can't really say anything. I mean look at Godzilla now, he's come a long way. The original Godzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese culture worldwide, and fairly enough deserves to hold this position. Overall, Ishiro Honda did a great job on the film. He did a great job at laying the foundation of the future Godzilla and science fiction movies that would soon follow. I do think this film should be viewed by everyone. Most of us have seen the modern Godzilla so it's only fair to see how far this iconic monster has come.",positive
"I really wanted to see this movie but when we watched it the voices instantly struck as very strange, I don't know if it was the version we found or if it's supposed to be some but we heard voiceovers that sounded like Stephen Hawking's speech centre, utterly dreadful, trended it off before it got 10 mins in.I think I'll watch the first remake, least it'll sound good, sheesh.",negative
"The movie struggles between unbelievable timeless greateness and vulgar japanese melodrama. ""oh, i broke a promise, oh my...""The ending, however, is one of the most moving pieces of cinema i have ever seen. Gojira waking up in deep sea, as cosy as a cat in its blanket, and then the stuff that follows. Beautiful imagery. I cried like a baby. I love you Gojira - you were nothing but the right hand of justice and the left hand of precious natural balance.",negative
"This film is smothered in paranoia and anxiety from beginning to end. It gives a glimpse of the fear, terror, and destruction an atomic bomb causes. The pacing is slow, which makes it seem longer than it really is. However, Godzilla encapsulates the aftermath of an historic event.",positive

"Most Americans have to this day never seen this movie. When you say ""Godzilla movie"" they'll go off on some tangent about ""guy in a rubber suit"" (as if in 1954 there was a better way) ""cheesy special effects"" (even though this movie established the state of the art) and something about Raymond Burr's wooden performance. Had the releasing company only had faith that American audiences would watch a monster movie with subtitles (or had bothered to do a dubbed version) the history of science-fiction monster movies would be vastly different, because this is a good movie on most levels and an excellent, genre- establishing one on others. And by the way, like any good movie, it can only be properly appreciated on a MOVIE SCREEN and not on your TV/device et al. After all, can you properly appreciate an Edward Turner painting from a postcard sized picture of it?The pacing, cinematography and stories (there are at least three) are all top quality. And as an historical note, this movie was being made at the same studio at the same time as The Seven Samurai - and even has a cast crossover. Kudos also to the late Haruo Nakajima, the ""suitmation"" actor who brought Gojira to life.I saw the original release as a kid in 1956 and many times afterwards. Then in the 1980's I saw this version at The Public Theater in NY and I was shocked at how much better a film it was. Then I saw it at The Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles in the 90's. As I was leaving, another viewer said to me ""If this version had been released instead of the Raymond Burr version..."". I just said ""Yeah.""",negative
"Frankly, I was disappointed. I have heard this described as the second greatest Japanese film after Kurasawa's Seven Samurai. Not even close.Godzilla (Gojira) is a sincere drama with well done traditional photography and competent direction. Except for the cheesy special effects and reliance on night photography to hide their obvious imperfections, the production values were high. Cultural differences may have been at play here, but I did not find much of the acting believable. I know very little Japanese, but did notice the English subtitles at times didn't adequately convey what the characters were actually saying or doing. I'd like to watch this again with a native speaker to get his take on it.This film was made 9 years after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. As a snapshot of the Japanese psyche at that time, I found it quite interesting. The fear of nuclear annihilation was palpable. In one of Godzilla's first attacks, there's a brief exchange between 2 train passengers where a woman says she narrowly missed being killed in the Nagasaki bombing. Her travel companion basically says he's done running from random annihilation.Unlike many later ""stomp and burn"" sequels, this one made the human cost of lost cities crystal clear. There were several affecting scenes showing the aftermath in emergency shelters In much the same way as the US Army documented women and children following the Hiroshima bombing. There was also an auditorium full of schoolgirls singing out a poetic plea for peace.In a not too subtle role reversal, heroic scientist Dr. Serizawa agonizes over whether he should unleash the terrible elemental force of nature he has discovered. His fear is that after the evil monster is destroyed by it, equally evil men will find a way to weaponize it. Pretty thinly veiled reference to the difficult moral dilemma faced by Allied nuclear weapon scientists in WWII.Was it great cinema? In my opinion, no. Was it an interesting snapshot of the post-Hiroshima Japanese mindset? For me, it was. Not recommended unless you have a fascination with the particular place and time in which it is set.",negative
"I am a fan of the newer Godzilla movies such as, Final Wars or Godzilla 2000, but after watching the original 1954 classic, I finally realized what Godzilla is! From the soundtrack to the design of Godzilla, is creepy but great. If I had to pick one classic horror film to watch at midnight, it would be Godzilla without question! Do yourself a favor and check out this classic monster movie, even if you've seen the American version, I still recommend you watch the original subtitled version, because I believe it is a lot better! I also recommend you watch some of the other Godzilla movies if you haven't, I think they are all a lot of fun!",positive
"OK so it's hard not to like this one. Despite the incredibly cheesy nature of this English dubbed Japanese freak show, it just set the bar for those crazy science fiction monster movies. Not the best technical movie, even though back then it won a Japanese Academy Award for best special effects, but still a good story. And in a larger sense it was kind of seen as a symbolic film and a film a lot of Japanese could relate to. In fact America had just drop an atomic bomb in Japan so it was definitely a movie that the Japanese people could definitely relate to in terms of disaster. I do feel bad for this movie though because it is so easy for my generation to make fun of how incredibly cheesy this is. When really I think that the director was trying to send a legitimate message and use symbolism to his advantage in order to make a movie that was terrifying to the Japanese people on so many levels we could not even begin to fathom. And this definitely opened the door for the crappy American remake and many other less authentic remakes. About the only good movie I have ever seen that Gojira influenced was Cloverfield. But this movie speaks very highly of the creative filmmaking that the Japanese had at there disposal back then. And while they were technically behind the rest of the world in so many ways they were still able to come up with original stories and certain ways of doing things with their films that really defined Japanese cinema as a contender of their time.",negative
Am I the last one to know that Gojira is Godzilla? I honestly have never taken the time to investigate. Always figured Godzilla had one name only. Now I am wondering if Raymond (Perry Mason) Burr could help him get his name legally changed to prevent the kind of confusion I went through. For me to have never heard of Gojira was irritating as I've been watching Japanese films for decades. Since this isn't a new film to me and the review would be redundant I'll just come back with a comment on a different Japanese movie. Say HaraKiri - Death Of A Samurai.,positive
"Godzilla truly achieves something special aside from spearheading the Kaiju genre (although King Kong may have been first, it is Godzilla that effectively creates a metaphoric cinematic creature that drives the film) in that it tells a heart-wrenching story of fear, panic, and distrust amidst an unprecedented event.While the allegory may be thinly veiled (and even referenced as a sort of alternate reality) in alluding to the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it's impact is certainly as potent as the most elusive allegories. Perhaps partially because the times were so uncertain and the effects of the bomb so fresh in everyone's minds, Godzilla truly strikes a chilling note deep in the bones of the viewer and achieves a feeling of sheer terror.What makes the terror so real and potent isn't Godzilla itself, not is it the practical effects that make Godzilla feel so lifelike for a film that has absolutely zero digital editing, but in the way the characters react, in the way humans respond to the destruction and threat of further destruction. It is extremely honest and harrowing, and that is what truly drives the feeling of fear so far home in Godzilla. A true classic and pioneer of its genre: 8/10.",positive
"Beyond its unequivocal relevant themes regarding the dangers of unsupervised science and information control, it's even more impressive to see nowadays the visual mastery behind this movie, in the way it is able to convey smartly the scale of the creature with such limited means at the time. In the beginning, we only see glimpses of the monster in the distance at daylight, relying the movie from the credits on the sound of its footsteps to signal us the kaiju's subsequent appearance.The first time time Gojira literally steps foot on the city, we never get to see it if not engulfed in the darkness of the night. In the population's most vulnerable time, as the titular character gets closer, the stationary camera is able to frame, at each new step, less and less of the creature. Its scale, bigger with every second, is inconceivable compared to the humans that run in the foreground of the image. And so, we realise the real nature of this apparently unstoppable threat, as we hear the iconic brass theme that accompanies it.",positive
"**SPOILERS**As a child in the early eighties my first experience of Godzilla was the cartoon.  It was similar to Scooby Doo (but not as good) save that a boat replaced the camper van and the monsters were real instead of being a caretaker dressed up in a luminous deep-sea diving suit.  A few years later and I saw the Eighties remake of Godzilla but was nonplussed.  In the early Nineties and beyond I have seen a veritable menagerie of proper' Toho productions from the Sixties and Seventies.  They all featured Godzilla and other giant monsters scrapping and stomping on cities.  The best of them was Destroy All Monsters for the sheer range of monsters on display.  Now I have finally seen the original film which spawned all these aforementioned sequels and spin-offs.Merchant ships are mysteriously vanishing of the coast of Japan.  Any rescue ships dispatched also disappear.   Next a coastal village on the island of Odo is flattened.  The scientific expedition sent to investigate hears local tales of an ancient sea monster called Godzilla.  Initial scepticism turns to horror as they encounter the beast  a giant carnosaur from prehistory that leaves a residue of radiation in its wake.Godzilla is easily a better film than any of its descendants.  The film's tone is a lot darker and more serious than any of the light-hearted sequels. Only Godzilla Vs. Hedora, of the films I've seen, approaches the same depth, but is let down by its childish and heart-on-sleeve execution.  More fitting bedfellows for Godzilla are films such as King Kong (easily the best giant monster movie ever made), Them!, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Gorgo.  Indeed as Godzilla is a parable for the dangers of radiation it has much in common with the slew of American sci-fi/horror films of the Fifties.The shadow of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki pervades the entire film.  The scenes of the ruined city, the victims crowded into hospitals, the young child contaminated with radiation all recollect the horrors of nuclear warfare.  The heroine even mentions that she was at Nagasaki.  Dr. Serizawa's development of the `oxygen destroyer' and his moral concerns other its use could be seen as a mirror to the Manhattan Project or indeed the scientific discovery/development of any weapon. Scientific culpability and responsibility is a major concern of the film. Note that Serizawa is blind in one eye (represents the moral blindness/neutrality of science) and sighted (obviously) in the other (represents his humanity).  The fact that Godzilla is a Japanese film gives it a palpable feeling of both anger and sadness.*spoilers*The scenes of Godzilla trashing Tokyo are filled with unexpectedly poignant moments.  These include the journalists who continue reporting until their demise and the mother and her children eagerly awaiting death so that they can be reunited with their husband/father.  The onslaught occurs at night and the lighting used is deliberately dark.  This is doubly effective as it accentuates the brilliance of the explosions and fire and also hides the limitations of the model work/special effects.  The realisation of similar scenes in the subsequent colour films is crude by comparison.To its detriment the scientific accuracy of the film is somewhat lacking. According to the renowned palaeontologist Dr. Yamane the dinosaurs existed two million years ago.  Two hundred to sixty-five million more like!  Also would the `oxygen destroyer' (loopy idea) cause organisms to disintegrate. Wouldn't they just suffocate; unless it effects oxygen in living tissue as well as the environment.  Then why didn't the scientists try to deliver it subcutaneously and thus avoid any widespread environmental damage.  I thought the four protagonists would use the device secretly thus avoiding any widespread knowledge and possible misuse.Finally, what is Godzilla (apart from any metaphorical interpretation)? According to the expert Dr. Yamane it is an intermediate form between terrestrial dinosaurs and marine reptiles.  Its appearance is that of a gargantuan carnosaur (tyrannosaur, allosaur, etc.) with the back plates of a stegosaur.  And it breathes fire like a dragon.  No wonder the dinosaurs became extinct with Godzilla about!",negative
"Never ceases to amaze me! Without this movie, would we have other Japanese franchises like Ultraman? 1954 was a good year for Toho, because this, along with Seven Samurai, made Toho a household name, not just in Japan but in the US as well! It takes my breath away, every single time I watch it! Not unlike an oxygen destroyer! (Insert laugh track here)",positive
"For the longest time, I truly thought that cinema before 1970 wasn't worth my time. Godzilla was the first time I truly connected with an ""old"" movie. The titular monster is a perfect symbol for the suffering and fear the nation of Japan felt post-World War 2. Although the ""scares"" don't really hold up in the present day, the tragedy and sorrow is still incredibly present.",positive
"The soundtrack is 11/10 the practical effects are ahead of their time the acting is good the sense of dread and fear is really present and best of all the film actually means something
(Godzilla being an embodiment of the A-bomb which was dropped on Japan to end the war in other words to defeat a monster they had to create a monster which is what happens in this movie they had to create a monster to defeat one and given this was only nine years after the bombing it was a very controversial topic at the time and is still to a much lesser extent one now)",positive
"If you have only seen the version with Canadian actor Raymond Burr, you should see this version. When this was adapted by the U. S. distributor, many scenes were cut, which reduced the background and development. Apparently, it was believed that the emotional progressions of the main characters would not be of interest to audiences in North America. While the U. S. release retains much of the destruction of the great lizard, some good ""special effects"" were cut out, including part of the train scene. In the American version, there wasn't even an attempt to have the Raymond Burr parts match the background or density of the parts actually filmed in Japan. See the Original.",positive
This is one of the best films ever created Godzilla was seen as a form of destruction and the movie is really dark like when godzilla is rampaging a mother hugs there kids and tell them there going to join there dad in heaven jeez the characters are amazing and so is the acting this is a must see for a godzilla fan like my self or a casual viewer.,positive
Godzilla 54 is not your usual Godzilla movie where its fun and campy . This movie is very series in tone . I mean a lot monster movies in the 50s try to be serious they kinda come off campy not this one . Fell like this movie works extremely well in black and white giving it a gritty feel to it . Godzilla is kinda of misunderstood creature mean obviously he didn't want to be awaken by atomic bombs. The characters are amazing and the acting is perfect from everyone even from Akita Takrada who this was his first film . I don't really need to talk about Godzilla himself he is one of the most iconic monsters of all time . Also I love the ending to this film where its not happy and people aren't cheering when Godzilla does die and when dr Serizawa dies . This not really not much more I can say just watch the movie 10/10.,positive
With the events of WW2 and Japan still recovering from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it's almost a miracle how this was even made with material scarce in Japan resulted in the Godzilla suit being made out of concrete and this movie shows the disaster of the bombs at first hand as Godzilla being a metaphor of the bombs from 1945 the story is immersive and Godzilla actually looks unsettling and terrifying in some shots and the shots of The Japanese crying out for help are really unsettling and the music by Akira ifukube is a masterpiece in its own each music piece perfectly let's the viewer know it's scary and unsettling Hats off to the Japanese 👏🏻🇯🇵,positive
"The original Japanese Gojira is a historical classic. While it may seem a little ""hokey"" when considering contemporary special effects capabilities, the film nonetheless seems to rectify the hokey destruction scenes with realistic, dramatic, and depressing ""aftermath"" scenes where orphaned children are crying, families are destroyed, and lives are lost as a result of Gojira's destructive wake. When analyzing Gojira's destructive capabilities it's important to remember that Gojira was produced at a time when the after-effects of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were still remnant in the Japanese psyche and Western society at large with the looming Cold War and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust. Gojira as a film seems to dissect these delicate matters in a cinematic format by emphasizing how the widespread destruction in the film was brought about by nuclear testing that awakened a dormant Gojira. Indeed, Gojira himself is a metaphor for the destructive capabilities of nuclear weapons.In that same regard, what I found most interesting about the film is its humanistic elements in regards to both a destructive Gojira and the scientific discovery that led to Gojira's death. The archeologist's pressing belief that Gojira should be captured and studied rather than just destroyed entirely showed that even something as destructive, horrific, and grotesque as Gojira deserved a bit of humanity required for advancement of the human race.Furthermore, the scientist in the film who develops the ""anti-oxygen"" chemical reaction to kill Gojira commits suicide alongside an asphyxiating Gojira by cutting the rope needed to get back aboard the ship. The scientist knew the destructive capabilities of his finding and did not want the world to apply it towards evil purposes. By committing suicide, the scientist forgoes the lucrative possibilities related to his finding for the betterment of man-kind. What is most interesting is that his suicide would be considered heroic and honorific in Japanese culture versus shameful in Western culture. Indeed, one will get a glimpse at the very different Japanese historical perspective by watching the original Gojira in its entirety.Go watch it this weekend.",negative
"In America, Godzilla has always been viewed as a poorly made comical movie with low production values. This however, was not the intention of its creators. Godzilla is more than a movie about a giant rubber monster that comes out of the ocean and devours Japan. Godzilla is a powerful symbol of the distressing after-math of the atomic bomb on Japan that also represents the ""evils of science"", and a countries ability to deal with disaster. Throughout its many translations, the serious message in Godzilla has been completely over-looked and lost. The fact still remains however, that Godzilla is the beast of war. There is vivid imagery throughout the 1954 film of Gojira, that depicts WWII and it's effect on the people. An example of this would be the overflowing hospital after Godzilla attacks the city. During these scenes, heartache and death were depicted when innocent children were screaming for lost family members. It is implied that the purpose of those scenes is to identify the similar consequences of the Japan bombing. Another scene involves some citizens on a train talking about the safest place to hide from Godzilla, when one man mentions taking his family to the shelters, another man responds, ""the shelters again?"" (2). By saying ""again"" the man is referring to the way of life during WWII when people would take refuge in shelters and live there for as long as they could. It was an uncomfortable and depressing time for Japanese citizens while they waited for the war to end. Other depictions of post-WWII trauma is a scene in the film where a woman is sitting in the street of the town waiting for Godzilla to kill her and her three children while saying, ""It's okay. We will join your father soon""(2). It was a highly emotional scene and some people would even get up and leave the theater (4). Not only was this woman terrified of Godzilla, she was scared of continuing her life without her husband. It is an emotionally jolting metaphor of how the war left families in shambles and destroyed most of their means of living. This scene was cut out in the American version. Because American's decided to delete these emotionally trying and important scenes, the film that was released in the United States did not target the same audience, cause the same effect, or inspire compassion for the Japanese civilians affected by this terrible tragedy.",negative
I like the English version better it's great and it has an American at like Raymond burr,positive
This movie was a great Classical horror movie if you like Godzilla I recommend getting some pop corn and watching this movie this movie will make you think that movies don't have to be new to be good.,positive
"I'm a huge Godzilla fan, and in my humble opinion, this is the greatest movie ever made. The sombre, apocolyptic feel has been imitated several times, but never even half-way duplicated. The direction, music, scripting and acting is all masterful, even after 47 years. Admittedly it would spawn some pretty awful sequels, but this is still a great cinematic achievement. People who condemn Godzilla in general have obviously never seen this movie. I say this movie is required viewing for anyone who feels ready to embrace Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's abomination. Long live the King of the Monsters!",negative
Very boring only hardcore new generation bent on destruction fans who aren't into character development will like this.,negative
I know this is the first godzilla movie which is why I can give it respect for creating the monster in the first place. I fully respect the 1998 film tho for giving godzilla a new menacing look but I'm more forgiving to the charm of this film and the one (and only time) this design should have been used.,positive
"This film excels in what a lot of the Godzilla movies fail at. It displays the impact on the humans from the destruction of the monster very well. From the girls singing in the church to the broken scientist dealing with the decision to release his weapon of mass destruction. It is a true origin story explaining the radioactive element to the monster well, during a time nuclear weapons held a significant amount of trauma and interest in Japanese culture.",negative
"Although this had a rather original concept for the time that it was made, it's way to in your face and simplistic to be a true masterpiece. They were obviously trying to pass the film off as some kind of statement against pollution and radioactivity. But the fact that the film doesn't make very much sense overrides the statement attempt. How on earth did this creature happen? It's not only stupid, it's not physiologically possible. He melts things? Really? In any case, it could have been saved if the people in the film were likable. But literally, the characters are extremely 2D and uninteresting to the point that the audience doesn't care if they die or not. At the end of the film when the ""scientist"" nobly sacrifices himself so that his ""brilliant"" invention won't fall into the wrong hands I couldn't help but laugh. Don't they realize that's the dumbest idea ever? First of all, a machine that destroys oxygen? Huh? And second of all, if this ever worked, which it wouldn't, that would mean that he just destroyed all of the oxygen in the ENTIRE ocean. No more fish. At all. There goes the ecosystem and much of Japans source of income/ food Then there was the other scientist who served no purpose at all other than to cry over the poor little radiological anomaly as he rampaged cities and killed thousands. Oh no! Don't kill him! He doesn't mean it! I will make no attempt to criticize the wailing, fainting heroine who serves no purpose at all. I don't need to. So the fact that the plot is a bit sketchy plus the horrible acting and unlikeable characters makes the film more comical than frightening. Neither of these things are helped at all by the famously atrocious special effects. A man in a rubber suit walking over little toy trains, buildings, and helicopters isn't as scary as you may first think it would be.",negative
"They created, attacked and disturbed him and yet they use the oxygen destroyer to kill him off thereby committing genocide.And there is a foreigner always standing around observing, telephoning, typing and stinking it up.Emiko is thin and attractive.",positive
"The movie that started the franchise and character is easily the best movie in the franchise objectively. While not the most entertaining, this movie is ahead of its time in my opinion, and is a great metaphor for the destruction and aftermath caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Gojira's roar and appearance are both great, and frightening. The human plot is great, as it shows a realistic response to the discovery of Gojira, and the suffering of the Japanese people. The effects are amazing for the time, and each appearance of Gojira is great and fits the dark tone well. The amazing and iconic music also compliments the themes (most of the time), in both frightening and emotional moments.Some aspects are outdated or look and seem a bit silly, but the release date must be considered. There isn't much else to complain about with this movie. This movie gets a 9/10 from me, but 7/10 entertainment wise.",positive
The story focuses more on the character (esp Dr Serizawa) than Gojira.,negative
"It was tough for me to read the subtitles and watch the screen at the same time. Obviously, that's not the fault of the creators, but I do think it hampered my experience a little bit. I was fortunate enough to watch the Criterion Collection's restoration, as it kept in a reference to the atomic bombings that I think adds to the effectiveness of the film's allegory.Overall, I think the film got its message across well, and despite my difficulties with the subtitles I found the characters engaging. The special effects were quite good for the time as well, though at times I do find Godzilla more cute than terrifying.",positive
"This movie Godzilla 1954, is so cool it is dark, violent, depressing, and exciting.The movie has a lot of action, like scenes where tank's, artillery, and planes are shooting and bombing Godzilla, and then Godzilla blasts them with his Atomic breath.The violence level is not to bad but some scenes can look kind of scary since the film is filmed in black and white, which gives the film that dark and depressing feel. Teenagers and kids will defiantly enjoy the action but I don't know if they will like the fact that the film is in English subtitles and Japanese dubbing. Overall 10/10.",positive
"I had read many good reviews, but this movie disappointed immensely. It is worse than most movies of the 50s yet became famous for its anti-nuclear message. What is lost though is the script and 50s effects. There are many movies made better. It's amazing it spawned so many sequels.",negative
"The previous reviewer completely fails to understand the charm and pleasure of watching a Godzilla film. What makes this Godzilla movie stand above the other monster-in-a-suit film is that there are real human drama involved. The film, even with this American editing. is a dark and serious tale of the horror of the atom bomb as experienced by Japan. The previous reviewer fails to realize that this American edition cut the original film from almost 97 minutes to a mere 79 minutes, leaving many details of the plot out.Second, The romance between the two characters of the scientist and the daughter betrothed to her was not the central theme of the story. The story concentrates on the the moral dilemma that Dr. Serasawa is forced to confront, to either use his powerful weapon of oxygen destroyer to eliminate Godzilla or prevent its use and hence preventing it falling into the military hands into another weapon like the atom bomb. It is his painful choice at the end that gives the film so much poignancy.Third, looking at the special effects from the present, of course it is cheesy and fake. But for its 1950's period, it is indeed quite good. The night scenes with Godzilla rising out of the water is meant to convey the ferocity and evil of Godzilla, heightened by the excellent music score. The scene of Godzilla's silhouette against a burning Tokyo is a classic scene itched into Japanese cinema.All in all, an excellent film, subsequent Godzilla films are indeed rather comedic, but this original film is a dark, serious and unforgettable film.",negative
"A great film, brooding and intense and engrossing.  However, it's a shame the real ""payoff"" scene of the film goes virtually unscored...the raid on Tokyo could've benefitted from Ifikube's striking music, but as it is the sequence seems to go on for a little longer than it should.  Ah, well. Still great by all standards.  effects are great for their time (Ignore comments by ignorant people like Kilroy about the level of effects work) The music is great; all in all the fact this movie has spawned a half-century of sequels doesn't surprise me.",negative
"Since the debut of this film, It's been narrowly 70 years after its release, and plenty of other films based on it have come, gone, attempted to get closer to its quality, replicated it, used its image for another purposes.Nevertheless, no movie, and I mean no movie post of the original film, has toppled it.Seeing the damages of nuclear devastation, and how it affected not only the depicted japanese but the entire world, is truly astounding by being an ahead-of-its-time masterwork.May long live this movie.",positive
