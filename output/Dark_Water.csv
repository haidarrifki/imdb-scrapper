review,sentiment
"Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) is in the middle of a nasty divorce from her husband, Kunio Hamada (Fumiyo Kohinata). The biggest issue of contention is their daughter, Ikuko (Rio Kanno). Kunio accuses Yoshimi of being unstable, and he seems to have a point. Still, Yoshimi is awarded at least temporary custody of Ikuko. We see her finding an apartment for her and Ikuko to live in. They pick a less-than-ideal apartment, because it is affordable. Soon after, strange occurrences begin. Yoshimi's bedroom ceiling is developing a water stain. Mysterious puddles of water appear in different locations. An unusual item keeps appearing, despite attempts to discard it. Yoshimi periodically sees a strange girl, but only in glimpses. Ikuko begins acting oddly. On top of all this, Yoshimi is trying to go back to work, and she's having trouble balancing that with taking care of Ikuko. Things are spiraling out of control. Are the problems due to Yoshimi's divorce, or is there also something more sinister or supernatural going on? Despite Dark Water's relatively overt similarities to a number of other filmic works, this is one of director Hideo Nakata's most successful films--at least as good as his famed Ringu (1998), if not better. I came awfully close to giving Dark Water a 10 out of 10, and can easily see myself raising my score on subsequent viewings. Many facets of the film do not open up until you see them again. For example, when fact checking something about the film shortly before writing this review, I re-watched the beginning; the opening credits are extremely eerie, but the full impact doesn't hit you until after you've seen the film once and more fully realize what you're looking at while watching the first shot.The similarities include quite a few thematic resemblances to Ringu, which shouldn't be surprising considering that not only is Nakata the director for both films, they are both based on novels by the man who is often called ""The Japanese Stephen King"", at least in the Japanese press--Koji Suzuki.Like Ringu, Dark Water's menace comes in the form of a young, long haired Japanese girl who makes frequent, mysterious appearances. Girls may be the focus because of irony--they're supposed to be cute (as is Kanno, who turns in a great performance along with her more adult fellow cast) and innocent. A girl menace should therefore be that much more unnerving.The menace is often accompanied by water. Water was important symbolism in Ringu, too. I would venture a guess that Nakata and/or Suzuki have a fear of water. It might be more impersonal, too. Water is a powerful force, both easily adapting to its surroundings and easily molding them. It permeates much of the world. As such, it's a good visual symbol for kami, which is the Shinto ""essence"" or ""beingness"" that permeates everything, and (among many other things) can be godlike, or the soul of a dead human, or tsumi, a ""pollution"" form of kami which could perhaps be also at least symbolically cleansed by water.Another important symbolic commonality shared by both Ringu and Dark Water is that of claustrophobic spaces. These occur in Ringu in forms like the well, closets and crawl spaces. Dark Water has the elevator and a structure for which you'll only realize the importance near the end of the film. Water combined with the elevator also enables Nakata to give a nice nod to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) in one scene.A further similarity to Ringu is that Dark Water is just as concerned with familial problems as it is concerned with horror. In fact, the horror may only be symbolic or may only be a metaphor for familial problems (in the Ringu/Ring films, this is made even more clear in Nakata's latest, American Ring film--The Ring Two, 2005). Both feature a young mother struggling to maintain a normal existence with her only child. In Dark Water, it is particularly easy to see the horror elements as mere metaphors for Yoshimi's psychological decline and the effects it has on her daughter, which echo her own problematic childhood--we learn that her parents were also divorced when she was young, and the opening dramatic scene of the film shows Yoshimi as a child, waiting at school for someone to pick her up. We also hear her comment that her mother was ""bad"".This is not to say that Dark Water has no focus on horror. Nakata's well known deliberate pacing is perfect here. The spooky events are subtle but unnerving, and Nakata achieves some amazing build-ups, such as the scene in the elevator near the end of the film, with a particularly frightening reveal. This reveal works as well as it does because Nakata takes so long to get there. He builds tension through stretching out pregnant pauses until the viewer is ready to burst. There are many such scenes throughout the film.Dark Water also succeeds because the story is kept relatively simple and straightforward. Unlike typical American films, much of the story is ""told"" through implication. As a viewer, you are frequently left to figure out decisions and events based on seemingly innocuous comments in an antecedent scene followed by relationship and scenario changes in a following scene. In other words, you have to make assumptions about what has happened. That might sound complex, but the aim, which is wonderfully achieved, is actually to simplify the events on screen. Although that famous Asian horror film dream logic is still present in the supernatural events, it doesn't usurp the plot, which continues to gradually hone in on and build up the tension between Yoshimi, her husband, Ikuko, the mystery girl, and the apartment complex. The ending, which comments on all of those elements and the profound ways that they've changed, is particularly uncanny and poignant.",positive
"In the middle of a difficult custody battle over her 6 year old daughter with her ex husband, Yoshimi Matsubara takes a flat in an old building in order to get some stability in their lives.  However the problems start with a constant and spreading leak in the ceiling of their flat and the sense of someone else being around the building.  Yoshimi becomes increasingly on edge when Ikuko appears to be effected.Setting out my stall from the start I really liked Ringu and was happy to see this film from the same director.  I knew nothing about it when I sat in the cinema and I think that is the best way to see it (although my plot synopsis about will have spoilt nothing).  Dark Water continues Nakata's ability of unsettling audiences with little devices.  Here he stays with the child theme from Ringu and it works very well despite being a much simpler plot that isn't anywhere near as clever as the other film.  However in terms of delivering scares Nakata builds with shadowy images and creeping effects  the spread of the leak across the ceiling is creepy and the reoccurring image of a child's pink bag becomes increasingly unnerving as the film progresses.The direction is strong throughout with the camera preferring to turn to see what the characters see rather than having something leap into view or simply be cut to  this turning movement can take seconds where our tension is build by being kept waiting.  Again the use of shadowy figures and fleeting glimpses of things is very creepy and it really worked for me much better than all the gore in the world.  It is a little ironic that one of the biggest jumps from the audience came from the film's one use of CGI effects, but this worked well simply due to the build up of suspense all the way through.To compliment this the film uses music and sound very well.  On the odd occasional it does the tradition thing where the music builds to up the tension, this works but is not unusual.  What works better is the use of music WHEN the creeps arrive!  Whenever Yoshimi looks at the leak the music gives it an unnerving quality that may not have existed with the shot alone. The simple plot makes for an effective little ghost story  there is an element of mystery here but it is more about the suspense than the history. This is OK but the ending is a little more predictable than I would have liked (at first glance) and the epilogue didn't really work for me and I felt it needed a stronger close (not necessarily a jump though).  I say `at first glance' because it appears predictable but really it changes where I thought the film was going and the whole basis for the creepy scenes  ie I had assumed that the girl was taking Ikuko for play etc  I'll say no more but you'll understand when you see it.The cast were good.  My friend said that Kuroki's Yoshimi was so sappy she wanted to slap her but I actually thought she played it well.  She convinced me she was a woman going through an emotionally challenging time and was being pushed.  There was an element of her overplaying (maybe? It could be taken as realism) the fear in order to heighten the audience's but really this was benefical to the film as a whole.  Kanno's Ikuko is excellent  I can't imagine a child I know being able to cope with that sort of filming but she does it very well and is a million miles from the annoying brats that Western films seem to dig up when required.  These two are excellent and have reasonable support characters but the real star is a character you only really glimpse and the creepy atmosphere created by Nakata.Overall anyone who saw the remake of Ringu (and it was No1 for a while) should ignore the subtitles and go and see this.  It lacks the depth of Ringu and the epilogue's search for a greater significance is a little plodding and out of place, but it is still an effective ghost story that is a painfully slow at times but only serves to make it genuinely unnerving and creepy throughout.",negative
"A story very similar in certain areas to another story by Hideo Nakata, but different enough to stand apart. Using similar techniques to the Ring series, Nakata employs askew camera angles, wide shots and the mixing of foreground and background, showing normality in one and abnormality in the other, often with the horrors in the background, unnoticed by the foreground characters. The use of audio, and indeed lack of in parts, heightens the tension and the feeling of unease even more. Throughout the film a nervousness grows, beginning with a slight niggle of something wrong, building to the final shocking realisations. Despite understanding the story before the end is reached, Nakato manages to pull you on through the story, in fact, even past where other films would have ended. Acting from the child is stunningly good, as is with the mother, with much of the story played out in the emotions of their faces rather than their actual words. This is perhaps what succeeds so well, the realism of the dialogue and the slow brooding story, with a distinct lack of action. Something Hollywood attempts to recreate in their unoriginal remakes.",positive
"This is my idea of a horror movie. No junk, no noise, no random jolts, but plenty of fear, delivered quietly and compactly, without fuss. It's the most suspenseful movie I've seen since ""Ring,"" and I think it's even better. Like that movie, it put my stomach in knots to prep them for the chills, which rose up like waves out of calm water. I thought ""Ring"" rather like a Robert Aickman story; this is as near as a movie can come. The director has uncanny skill in knowing where to place the camera and how long to hold a shot. And the leading actress gives a wonderful performance. Her face in the elevator...but that would be giving it away. The conclusion is foreseeable--maybe the ends of all ghost stories are foreseeable--but nonetheless satisfying. If you like tales of quietly disturbing dread, this is one for you.",positive
"Director Hideo Nakata's 1998 offering, ""Ringu,"" based on a book by the so-called ""Stephen King of Japan,"" Koji Suzuki, was one of the scariest movies I've seen in years. Thus, it was with great expectation that I popped the same team's 2002 effort, ""Dark Water,"" into my DVD player at home. And while this latter film may not be the horror masterpiece that ""Ringu"" is, it still has much to offer. The story here concerns a newly divorced mother, Yoshimi Matsubara (sympathetically portrayed by Hitomi Kuroki), who moves into a run-down apartment building with her 5-year-old daughter, Ikuko, while at the same time starting a new job and engaging in a custody battle. We really come to care about the plight of these two characters, especially when some decidedly creepy incidents in the building start to pile up, and this gradually escalating sense of there being something ""wrong"" with the building turns out to be fully justified. Whereas ""Ringu"" provided us with that truly terrifying TV crawl-through scene, ""Dark Water"" offers a scene that is also absolutely guaranteed to raise the hackles on the back of any viewer's neck (I'm thinking here of the one in the elevator near the end, natch). Similar again to ""Ringu,"" a water container turns out to be the site of a childhood tragedy, and a lank-haired ghost girl makes for one very creepy presence. Special kudos must be given here to young Rio Kanno, in her role as Ikuko. Kanno is just remarkable, and surely one of the most adorable kids I've ever seen on film. I'd give her a 9.8 on the Cute-O-Meter. With an involving story, excellent acting, some genuine chills and that great novelist/director pedigree mentioned above, ""Dark Water"" is a fine example of ""J-horror"" indeed, and if nothing else underlines the importance of having a really good building super!",positive
"The silence the newly divorced mother and her 6 year old daughter experience in an apartment block they have just moved into sets the mood here. We see how they are together realistically, that means lots of silence and little action. One aspect that makes this scary is this realistic depiction of isolation you can get in these houses. And you cant help but wish the best for the two, struggling with work, the divorce rights and beginning school. And it rains.Water starts dripping from the ceiling and soon it permeates the whole building creating an uneasy and nervous mood that sneaks in on you and when you're not ready for it makes your nerves scream. You know its gonna happen and you get a good idea of where its leading, but its so well made that it doesn't matter.",positive
"Hideo Nakata's ""Dark Water"" is one of the creepiest Japanese horror movies I have ever seen.A nervous mother Yoshimi Matsubara,undergoing divorce proceedings,moves into an apartment building that is haunted by a young girl,who disappeared years earlier.""Dark Water"" is a perfect horror film.It is based on a novel by Koji Suzuki,so fans of ""Ringu"" won't be disappointed.Nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion,rather than the overuse of special effects.He perfectly captures an atmosphere of uncontrollable fear.Hitomi Kuroki is excellent as the neurotic,paranoid Yoshimi and Rio Kanno is equally remarkable as her five year old daughter,Ikuko.So if you're a fan of Japanese horror give this one a look.10 out of 10.Highly recommended.",positive
"The American horror film scene has been getting staler and staler for the better part of two decades. We get the same boring clichés and jump scares packaged under different titles with little originality. That is not to say that there aren't some very good American horror films to be produced since the 1980s but the more Asian horror that I watch the more I see that they have taken up the torch and are producing the best horror movies of the era.Dark Water isn't necessarily one of the best Asian horror films to come out but it certainly is a good one. The American remake is really indicative of what is wrong with the industry in North America. The story is the same and many of the scenes are very similar but for some reason, some intangible reason, it is of remarkably lower quality. Even with a very talented actress in the lead role it still doesn't shine like the Japanese original, even though it possesses every required ingredient. It is these intangibles that the Asian horror scene has somehow mastered and the American scene has lost.Dark Water itself is a nice little ghost story. It is a slow-burner with an unsettling tale and reveals itself subtlety. The characters are not throw away fodder as in many modern American horror tales and there are some scenes that had me, a hardened horror veteran, wanting to squint my eyes at the television screen. This is not American horror in the sense that everything is not in your face blood, gore, and knife wielding psychos. This is a much more subtle, psychological tale. It will creep under your skin.Asian horror is the new standard. I hope that the American industry will learn thing a thing or two from the Asian scene and not just try to emulate it so that perhaps the next generation of filmmakers can bring the torch of horror back to the United States.",positive
"The reviser Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) has just divorced from her husband and is disputing the custody of their five years old daughter Ikuko Matsubara (Rio Kano) in the justice. She is looking for an apartment and a job to restart her life alone with Ikuko. She finds a small old apartment, and she does not pay attention to a stain of water on the ceiling. When she moves to the apartment, she notes that there is a drip of water in the bedroom, and she asks the landlord to repair the leakage. Meanwhile, Ikuko finds a red bag on the terrace, and Yoshimi returns it to the administrator. Yoshimi sees the creepy shape of a girl wearing a yellow coat, and she finds that she resembles a young girl that has been missing for two years in the neighborhood. She becomes afraid that the girl might be a ghost.""Honogurai Mizu no Soko Kara"" is a tense low-paced horror movie, with a frightening and original story. The characters and the situation are slowly developed, the climax is scary, but I did not like the conclusion. I was really a little disappointed, since I expected much more. However, this film is another great Japanese horror movie, the best producers of this genre in the present days. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dark Water  Água Negra"" (""Dark Water  Black Water"")",positive
"My theory of why I responded so strongly with Dark Water is that it's about people that you can relate to. It isn't about a cop who searches for the serial killer leaving cryptic puzzles, nor a lawyer who defends a crazy murderer who may not be the real killer, etc. It's about a single mother who's on the verge of losing one thing she cares for the most - her daughter. She has to go for job interviews, she has to find a place to live with little money, and she has to see a divorce lawyer to fend off her rather nasty (yet not unreasonable) husband. Life's tough for Yoshimi, and who could not identify with her? I certainly did, and maybe it's the main reason why the movie worked on me so well. I sympathised her character and her predicament. I cared for her choice. I kept thinking, 'God, please give this poor woman a break.', but as every good movie must, problems keep piling up on her already over-burdened shoulder, and the ghost haunting that old, damp apartment doesn't help her situation. As many other reviewers mentioned, this is not all that scary. If you are looking for pure Asian horror to scare you s***less, this isn't it. But on some level it worked on me better than, say, Grudge, because the characters inhabit this picture felt real. Natural performances from the little girl were just amazing (except a couple of spots where her acting was just little off), but overall I totally bought her character. When she says she needs no one but her mother, I felt a tingle of sensation in my eyes - I wanted them to be together as their love seemed so real. Hitomi Kuroki, playing the motehr, nicely underplays her role - she is polite and tries so hard to pull her life together against overwhelming odds. She is the center of this picture in every single sense.Also consider the characters in Dark Water, they are all firmly grounded on reality. The divorce lawyer for example, when she tells him that she sees a ghost, he calmly examines the apartment and offers the most reasonable advice that any lawyer would give. Even the husband, while nasty, never oversteps the line of a villain. He after all does care for the welfare of the little girl, and concerns that she sometimes doesn't pick up the child in time. This is a sad, tragic drama that deals with the souls of the children abandoned and lost by their parents. When that yellow flashback plays on the screen, I felt more pity than horror, so much so the last scene where Yoshimi held up that dead child, maybe it all made sense.Ending perhaps was little weak - maybe because I cared so much about Yoshimi and her daughter, I just wanted them to be happy and together. Not like this. All great movies regardless their genre constructs human drama as its core. While this may not be a great movie, but a damned fine human drama with a streak of horror this is.",negative
"When I began watching ""Dark Water"" I was surprised to see that the film was dubbed into English. In recent years, dubbing has nearly died out and subtitles have reigned supreme, so I was surprised. However much I dislike dubbing, however, the quality of this dub was actually pretty good.The story begins with a mother and her young daughter going through a divorce. Her husband is fighting her for custody, so the woman feels a lot of pressure to get a job and an apartment. While she is able to do both, the pressure only gets worse as the apartment building appears to be haunted by the spirit of some creepy child. And, thought the course of the film, this creepy kid seems to be calling out to the mother and her girl. What's next? See the film.While many of the story elements are very familiar if you've seen more than a few Japanese horror films, they are assembled quite well. Plus, most importantly, the mood is excellent--with creepy music and effective direction and editing to create the proper mood. Well worth seeing.",positive
"I was a little surprised when I found out that this summer's ""Dark Water"" was a remake of a Japanese movie. From the director of ""Ringu"" (remade as ""The Ring""), ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" has recently divorced Yoshimo Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) and her daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno) moving into an apartment that carries a deadly secret.Obviously, there are likely to be complaints about the American remake. I thought that the remake was well-done, but I do have to side with the original. It gives one a sense of claustrophobia and descent into madness and desperation. We may have never thought that Japan could do horror, but this one and ""The Grudge"" disprove that. Very well-done.",positive
"This Japanese chiller is centred of Yoshimi Matsubara and her young daughter Ikuko. Yoshimi is in the process of divorcing her husband and they are caught up in a bitter custody battle. Needing somewhere to stay they move into a flat in an old apartment block. She soon complains about water dripping through the ceiling but nothing is done and it starts to get worse. Slightly creepy things soon start to happen; Ikuko finds a child's bag on the roof; it is handed in and later thrown away... then it reappears on the roof. There is also the local mystery of a young girl who vanished two years previously. As the story progresses the custody battle gets increasingly unpleasant and the sense that something is wrong in the apartment grows.If you like horror films with plenty of jump scares and gory deaths then this probably won't appeal to you; 'Dark Water' is all about atmosphere and director Hideo Nakata knows all about how to create a disturbing atmosphere. Things start out normally enough with much of the early part of the film feeling more like a social realism drama than a horror film. There are early hints that something isn't right though; mostly involving water where it shouldn't be. The building adds to the creepiness as it is a fairly normal, if rundown, apartment block rather than a really old building. As the film approaches its conclusion the creepiness increases to a point where I could feel myself getting goose-bumps. Hitomi Kuroki does a fine job as Yoshimi, she makes the character feel like a real mother trying to cope with a difficult situation rather than a typical 'horror heroine'. Young Rio Kanno also impresses as Ikuko; a real child rather than the precocious brats that tend to feature in western films. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of J-horror and well worth watching if you want a good chiller.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",positive
"Divorcée Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) and her young daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno) move into a run-down apartment block where they are haunted by the ghost of Mitsuko Kawai, an emotionally troubled little girl whose body has remained undiscovered since she accidentally drowned in the building's water storage tank two years earlier.Those who watch Hideo Nakata's Dark Water expecting a real fright-fest might be rather disappointed: it's a slow burner of a film that delivers a relentlessly brooding atmosphere, one of death and decay, but which is surprisingly short on nerve-jangling scares (unless, of course, you're freaked out by dripping water, red schoolbags, or six year old girls, in which case you'll be scared s**tless).Indeed, for most of the running time, Yoshimi or Ikuko never actually appear to be in any real danger from the film's restless spirit, their problems arising from far less ethereal sources, and it is only in the films closing moments that it becomes apparent that Mitsuko means to do Ikuko harm (so that she can claim Yoshimi as a surrogate mother) and the real horror begins.Although Nakata's direction is a little too languid in style for my taste, it is technically accomplished, with innovative camera-work and stunning cinematography throughout, and the cast give excellent performances; it might not have left me with the serious case of the jitters I had hoped for, but I had a reasonable enough time with Dark Water, and certainly recommend it over the dreary remake.",negative
"Dark Water is a truly unique film in that it worked on two different levels with me. First, it worked as a horror movie. No, it's not pee-your-pants scary with buckets of blood. Instead it's just plain old creepy with lots of spooky atmosphere. Even though much of the horror lurks at the periphery, it's a constant, definite presence. And when the horror does spill into the characters everyday lives, it's very effective. Who would have thought that a little girl's Kimiko bag could be so eerie? Second, Dark Water works as a drama. I bought the pain of the mother fighting to keep her child. And I felt the joy as the two played together. And in the end, when the mother realizes what she must do to save her child, I felt the heartbreak of both characters.The whole thing works because of some great acting. Hitomi Kuroki gives a remarkable performance as the mother. I believed and felt everything she was going through. Most of the Asian films I have seen recently have had good acting, but Kuroki's performance stands above the rest. As for the little girl, she's not the annoying child I'm so used to seeing in films like this. She seems real. It's a nice job by such a young person.My rating would be higher if it weren't for the predictable nature of what happened to the missing Mitsuko. It's should be apparent to anyone (other than the characters in Dark Water) where the child is and how she died. Still, it's a remarkable ride to an inevitable discovery.",positive
"Directed by the acclaimed Hideo Nakata, this Japanese horror was part of a number of films featuring ghostly black-haired children that courted a wave of popularity (and American remakes) alongside The Ring, the Eye and The Grudge.Recently divorced Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) and her young daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno) move into a rundown apartment block where there is an alarming – and growing – patch of damp dripping from the ceiling. Ikuko attends the local school and adapts quickly, but sees ghostly images of a dark haired youngster. This little spirit is often accompanied by puddles of water that seem to be reaching out towards Ikuko, like fingers. Could this be the local child that has recently gone missing, leaving only her red school satchel behind – a satchel that crops up in the most unlikely places?SPOILER: it emerges that the missing Mitsuko Kawai (Mirei Oguchi) drowned in a large water tank on the apartments' roofing whilst trying to retrieve her satchel. Now a ghost, she now sees Yoshimi as a kind of mother figure, and haunts her and her daughter, leading Yoshimi to make the ultimate sacrifice and appears to travel over to the 'the other side' to appease the spirit and save her daughter. This scene is illustrated as Yoshimi elects to stay in the elevator frequented by Mitsuko's spirit. When at last the sliding doors open before her, a vast outpouring of water envelops Ikuko. Of her mother, there is no sign – until ten years later when she revisits the apartments, dilapidated outside, but tidied and fresh inside. She sees her dead mother who assures her that as long as she is well, she is happy. Mitsuko is also there, but when Ikuko turns, she is gone.This is a good, creepy film that also carries a real emotional sting. Although Mitsuko has a history of instability, there is little doubt that the watery hauntings are real, and these are achieved very convincingly – none more so than when Mitsuko enters her flat once again after the damp patch on the roof has grown once more, to find filthy water pouring from the ceiling in every room. The effect is very much as if it is raining on the inside and is highly unsettling.The melancholy of the lonely little girl, now without a mother, is also palpable but at least we get (and she gets) some assurance that Mitsuko will always be watching over her.",positive
"Having seen Ring and Ring 2, I had to see this film.I had a vauge idea about the film as I had spoken to a freind who had seen it, but due to it being a night out and having one or two too many buds, the info I was given was a little hazy!!So I rented it out...This is a GREAT film, it was so well crafted that you are hooked straight away, the story is simple and the story is told in the same way, this I feel adds to the strange and eerie feel the film has all the way through.I thought this film was a great horror, no slashing and gore and no obvious attempts to make you jump, just slow, eerie, and very tense horror, that makes the hairs on your neck stand on end......I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror!!",positive
"This is not a story that could have been conceived in Arizona, say, or the Australian outback.All of Japan (except for Hokkaido) has its ""tsuyu"" or rainy season every year in May-June-July, depending on the part of the country. Some years, there really isn't much change in the weather. Other years, Westerners such as myself start to think about building an ark...the rain is that relentless. Humidity is 90% or higher, mold and mildew everywhere, centipedes appear in the bathroom, ...ugh.Of course if it actually continued to rain the entire movie, much of the eeriness of the movie would be lost--just because one wouldn't think oddly of all that water. Still, I think the original storyline must have come to the writer, Koji Suzuki, one rain-sodden June afternoon....As with so many films in this genre, top marks for mood and atmosphere. One of the better Japanese occult/ghost/horror movies of recent years.",positive
"After his acclaimed Ringu Hideo Nakata has made a brilliant, chilling horror film that won't soon be forgotten by any one who sees it.  Few films have the nerve to incorporate solid emotion into a good horror story. But this film is not afraid and it suceeds.  Because of the way it is you become so completely involved with the charachters and the storyline equally enhancing the scares ten fold. this film and everyone assoicated with should be commended for making one of the most terrifying horror movies of all time. It's about a woman and her young daughter whom move into a new apartment. It just so happens that the past occupant a little girl is haunting it.  And she must unravel the mystery as it approaches unrelentlessly.  Rush out and find this movie where ever you can. You won't regret it. Dark Water is an instant classic. prepare for some scare!!!!!!!!!",positive
"OK. Who Reviewed this GEM? Critics?.. I mean this is a Horror masterpiece. You cant make a more visually depressing horror than this one. May be the Grudge.. I am pretty sure that it has comparatively lower rating because there was a decent US Remake. Think someone doesnt do horror well or rather understand it. This is a gem, a masterpiece. Should be at atleast 8+",positive
"Are you like me and Netflix's ""The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel"" doc series got you wondering if the Dark Water movie mentioned within would have an added creepiness due to it's similarities to the real life events? If so, I'm here to say, it totally does! I don't think there's any great meaning to it like the internet sleuths in the doc do, but it is certainly a highly unusual coincidence how many parallels there are. The film features both a deadly roof top water tower and extensive sequences using grainy elevator security cam footage that are chillingly familiar. Keeping the Lam case in the back of your mind certainly adds an extra eerie layer to the already tense picture.The movie itself is firmly in the tradition of 00s J Horror, hitting many of the expected tropes along the way. Compared to it's contemporaries though, it's distinctly more low key, frequently favouring tension building over jump scares and CGI monsters. In a way, it almost functions more as a dreary family drama, exploring the hardships of a limited income mother struggling through a heated custody battle. The slow pacing makes the subtle chills all the more effective, keeping things as classy as a ghost movie can be.",positive
"Version: Japanese, English subtitles (by SBS)I found something in 'Dark Water'. A sort of revelation. Something that no other Japanese horror movie had made me think about it - is it really necessary to stop and put your shoes on / take your shoes off, whilst running around in terror? And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, I've just debased this fine movie - in a single paragraph - like no one else could.Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) moves into a new apartment after tentatively winning a custody battle for her daughter, Ikuko. However, life as a single-mother for Yoshimi is time consuming, and her husband and social workers are becoming increasingly convinced that Yoshimi is not fit to take care of Ikuko. Things get worse for Yoshimi when water continues to leak into her apartment from the room above, and other strange events in the apartment building constantly haunt her.'Dark Water' is presented as a horror movie, and I was expecting a horror film similar Nakata's 'Ring'. 'Dark Water' is not really a horror film, but more of a supernatural drama. Either way, it is a fantastic film. It starts off slowly, maintaining a sense of mystery until reaching a rather creepy climax. I'm not a big fan of Nakata's 'Ring' films, but 'Dark Water' is a great film, even if it is not really the horror film it is made out to be.Now back to my comment in the opening paragraph: For those who don't know, one tradition in Japan is for people to leave their shoes in the hallway when entering a household. I noticed several times that even though Yoshimi was running around in terror, she made to sure to put her shoes on, or take them off. ""Why is this important?"", you may ask. Well, it made no difference in 'Dark Water', but what about the poor souls trapped in 'Wild Zero' or 'Wizard of Darkness' who are definitely going to be caught doing the shoe thing?'Dark Water' is a great movie - I even feel that I should not debase such a fine movie with my style of review, but I'm still perplexed by the whole shoe thing - 9/10",positive
"J-horror is fast becoming the only kind of horror to convey the real chills and not resort to cheap thrills. Even before the massive, global success of RINGU in 1998, the sub-genre had been around: it just hadn't really been discovered this side of the globe. Of course, once that came around, Americans began tinkering with concepts closer to the essence of technology and alienation more proper for Asian culture in order to create stories that were either remakes of these original stories (themselves based in folklore of vengeful ghosts). However, there is an element present in the original forms of these stories that can't be appropriated in its entirety elsewhere and only on one or two occasions, it's succeeded. The first was the American version of RINGU, THE RING, and now, DARK WATER.However, DARK WATER (2005) is different enough to stand on its own despite the clear similarities to its root idea. A little more elements were added and these managed to bring an edge to its own version without corrupting the core idea of a woman and her daughter caught in a supernatural circumstance. Also, due to Jennifer Connelly's performance -- she's on screen almost all the time -- as well as clever editing, the movie didn't cop out at any time.DARK WATER (2002) is a quieter affair, less reliant on the evil within an apartment building, closer to a mood piece that slowly takes form and only once relies on a boo tactic. In many ways, Stephen King could have penned it due to some vague references to dead children trying to communicate with the living, such as a passage in ""The Shining"" where Danny encounters the haunted spirit of a child caught in the playground, only seeing its beseeching hand pleading for him to come down and ""play with it forever"".What both movies have in common is a sheer build-up of terror that insinuates itself innocuously, then takes shape and form and finally consumes and destroys the family unit. The stories are essentially the same, but in this version, the red knapsack makes a stronger and more insistent appearance until Yoshimi is nearly driven to distraction and makes a shocking discovery, but in this case, we get to see more of the little dead girl, always shown with her face partially hidden to the camera or walking away from us, dressed in her yellow raincoat -- a distant relative to DON'T LOOK NOW, also the story of another doomed girl leading to more horror. Every time she comes on screen the movie goes into a creepy tone: be it seen from a distance, calmly watching Yoshimi and Ikuko from her apartment, or walking under the rain as some dark ambient music plays, meeting her fate at the top of the water tank, and in one harrowing moment, when Yoshimi discovers her daughter inside the water-logged apartment as the shadow of the ghost lingers on. Even her final denouement is strong, not a cheap thrill.Where the movie is best is when it's establishing its dread. Yoshimi's growing horror, looking over her shoulder to what we can vaguely see, or her psychic perceptions of what took place in the apartment. There's also an underlying sadness about the movie, usually not present in horror. The scene where little Ikuko comes to realize what has happened to her mother (in a scene reminiscent of the elevator scene from the movie THE SHINING) is heartbreaking, because it's less about the triumph of evil, more about the loss of a loved one. Because it bookends the story with a reunion of sorts between mother and daughter, it's also very bittersweet, and horror movies nowadays rely more on the evil per se than in the humanity of its characters. That in itself is an important device in humanizing horror than in focusing on the monstrosity of the events.",positive
"A classic Japanese horror movie that inspired a Hollywood remake. It is suitably understated. Moist and wet. Better, IMO than the Ring, which made japanese horror such an in-thing. Make sure you watch the epilogue at the end.",positive
"Another exceptional ghost story from Japan. The set-up on this one's familiar: a lonely mother, her precocious child, a creepy run-down apartment block haunted by the ghost of a little dark-haired girl. So far, so par for the course. Where the film excels is in two places: script and direction. The script delivers an ultimately moving, affecting story peopled by realistic characters we get to know and care about. Sure, there are no jump-in-your-seat moments as in some other Japanese ghost films, but they're not required; by the end, the film has turned into nothing less than a tragedy, and the horror is driven to the background.The direction is sublime (you'd expect as much, given that RING's Hideo Nakata is the man behind the lens). The dripping patch on the ceiling becomes monstrous in itself, and the atmosphere is palpable in every sequence. I loved the way that obvious scenes aren't shown, they don't need to be shown, the focus is on mood instead. Hollywood managed a decent remake of this, but even that had to show obvious stuff that wasn't required. Add in a cast giving top-notch performances and you have one of the finest the genre has to offer.",positive
"When I saw ""Ring"" I was slightly disappointed, as many claims were made to it being chilling, scariest-movie-of-the-year blah blah blah, and I was a little doubtful about whether I'd like this film. Well, I did. It was amazing, and I haven't been this scared since I was a little kid. This film goes above all the usual slasher/teen horror movies, and actually tries to scare the audience, rather than have a few jumpy moments.A divorcee and her daughter move into a flat, but some freaky goings-on and wicked damp make her fear for her, and her daughter's, safety. My only concern in this film was the parental skills of the mother, but thats by the by. My favourite actor in this film was by far Ikuku, aged 6. Kind of like a Japanese, female Hayley Joel Osmont, only without the same facial expression throughout the whole movie.A great psychological horror, I'd recommend this to people who aren't confused easily and like complex horrors.",positive
"Like most horror films this plays upon our fear of the monster that might loom in our homes at night with its dark shades giving that 'look out! Its behind you' feel. However, this is more original. It not only scares us with the prospect of the monster, but it presents us with a far more real horror, that of a parent's fear of losing the ability to find enough money to look after their child, to house them properly, to be a good parent, to give them a decent life. This film plays upon the paranoid, insecure feeling that no one else in the world values your relationship and love for your child and that only you alone are going to battle it out. So, without giving away too much, this is a rare horror film that manages a weepy ending as well as a truly spine tingling, shiver my timbers ending too.",positive
"I'm still amazed at how the public responds to this stuff.While I agree that this has some redeeming qualities, it's so predictable and derivative that I could tell after 5 minutes what the developments would be. I was about 80% accurate.Critics are easily pleased with anything japanese that uses european fantasy film structure. Funny.In 2003, there are still people who buy these women characters who behave like... well... women film characters.And the direction... 100% formulaic. No imagination. No innovation. Just the old recipes. I'm thankful for the sobriety, OK, but a little upset by the ripoffs. And the overacting. And the old manipulative tools. And the cheap trendy sound effects.I liked very much the scenes with the sympathetic lawyer. Excellent actor, I'll have to watch more from him.This has been compared to ""The Shining""... Well, some can't tell the difference between fresh and canned food. Poor Kubrick!Amenabar (Abre los Ojos), in the same genre and mannerisms, is far more interesting because he borrows from writers who had a vision (K. Dick among others). Here, what you get is the average Stephen King fast-fantasy syndrome. Well, that's the way it goes.",negative
"What a man, he has made all of the films that have scared me and creaped me out the most.  First ringu for which I was compleatly unawear of the end and is probaly the most intence peace of cinimar I have ever watched, now dark water probaly just as good.Just seen it to day at the cinimar, me and 4 other people, I realy dispare and only for a one day showing.  However no talking and thats nice, this film may not jump out like the ending of ringu but all the way throught its creapy.I loved the ending, just remembering the part in the lift.  Enought everyone go see it now, its just as good as ringu and probaly every time it rains or something leaks I will have shivers going down my spine.Forget all the negative reviews, their just babling because it does not have the ending of ringu.  Its a diffrent film, same style, diffrent setting, diffrent format but just as good.10 out of 10",positive
"'Honogurai mizu no soko kara'is far away from what I imagine to be a great film, but I can't say it's a bad movie either.The biggest problem in my opinion, is that many things in this movie are too vague without many explanations about many facts. (for example, what happened to Yoshimi when she decides to stay with Mitsuko?Is she really dead? If she is, where is her corpse? Why nobody found it?) It's great to horror movies have mysteries, but a director needs to be careful to not let those mysteries go too far,becoming a confusing film.Besides, it wasn't scary: I could not be terrified in a single moment,pretty different from 'Ju On'.But there is a great point: this movie has some sense of reality,not caring to be insensitive sometimes: Yoshimi dies, and it is a fact. Nothing of that Hollywood standard where all the good guys live, and all the bad ones are in hell. Ikuko needs to get over it,because there isn't a magic potion or a miracle who is going to let her mother alive.",negative
"First of all, this is an excellent movie. Being a fan of alternatives to the US box office cinema culture , i was blessed with discovering some awesome pieces of modern Asian cinema art, and this is definitely one of them. Most of the average movie watchers are not going to like this , I promise ( man, I sound like a movie snob ), but there is always the Hollywood remake! It is slow paced , carefully built, and unlike other horror movies , the characters are well analyzed and the director made a huge effort to tell a story , and not to make a compilation of scary scenes. And that even made me think that it is not really a horror movie , more of a human , social drama in which the director uses the supernatural element to put the spotlight on the main theme of the movie ( at least in my opinion ) - the love of a parent for his child. I mean , come on , it is so simple , the end of the movie ( even though soooooo masterfully crafted to make you think ) says it all - the final line that is. I usually do not this but now i am forced - SPOILERS :first , another apology for writing this , movies were invented for people to see them and not to read about them - so ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO SAW THE FILM AND Didn't UNDERSTAND IT WELL; second, the film is supposed to make you think and make your own conclusions , so be free to disagree with me; and now my view - she left with the ghost girl for only one reason - to protect her own child. People , I am tired of comments like she was obsessed with the ghost girl and loved her more then her own, you now that explanation sucks! She was INTERESTED about what happened to the girl that drowned because she was in this situation in her life where her own daughter was everything she had - her worries about her own child created a model in her mind of a little girl that needs to be taken care of, and guess who fits in that model! So , knowing that the ghost girl wouldn't leave them alone , she sacrificed herself for her daughter , so she can go on with her life free of these scary things that were happening to them. She made the right decision , didn't she ? Anyway , go see the film. I don't know about the remake, but i know about this one - watch it with open mind and think about it - you will be surprised. And at the end ,only to congratulate Mr. Nakata for the thing he has accomplished - he used a ghost story to paint a strong emotional picture ( or a I like to say - he used the dark water to paint the waterfall of life ) and created a go-and -see movie.",positive
"A truly memorable film, which succeeds not so much as a literal ghost story as an aching depiction of struggle, heartache, loneliness and loss.In some respects, the film might come across as pretty formulaic stuff, with generally predictable scares, a sometimes dubious script, and generic horror-film score (although there are also effective uses of background silence). Having said this, though, I should also add that the climax in the lift is genuinely shocking and heartrending. But what matters even more than the supernatural thrills is the all-too human story of the characters, the bleak atmosphere created, and the haunting imagery. All these elements the film pulls off remarkably well.The acting is pretty good. Admittedly, at first the mother appeared rather too high-strung to me, but that really is the kind of character she's meant to be. And the mother-child team is superb - there's real chemistry between the two.Dark Water is a notable accomplishment. It does often look like a formulaic supernatural thriller yet it transcends tired old clichés and conventions to be so much more; it manages to be consummately chilling, desolate, and poignant, all at the same time. As a work of art, and in terms of provoking genuine emotion, it succeeds (at any rate I found myself crying openly at the end, and I can honestly say I don't usually cry at films). Dark Water is arguably the best of the whole raft of Asian-horror films of the past two decades. At its core, it is a subtle, moving, and highly intelligent film, the like of which I've rarely seen, whether in the supernaturalist genre or out of it. A treat..",positive
"Like Audition it is the slow build up of real drama and tension that drives the supernatural effect. It is so important to ""keep it real"" as they say. I never thought water would scare me like it did in this movie but i did think while watching this, maybe only in japan a water mark on your ceiling could be interpreted as a horror theme or idea. Im glad i saw the original b4 us version. I made the mistake once with the grudge. The Yanks don't get that its Japanese culture that conflicts so well with horror elements. Their culture seems so reserved anyway it naturally creates a harsh juxtaposition with anything extreme, violent or weird. I love the Japanese culture and if you compare this type of film to Lost in Translation you can see how right Coppola got it. Maybe the west just doesn't get Japanese society. We are so different. Subtlety people is the key. Im Australian and i don't know the meaning, but I'm trying to learn.",positive
"So far, watching Asian horror, I've noticed that they can really make me care so much about the characters or the families. As a idiotic westerner, I'm used to ""watered"" down horror movies with cheap jump scares characters that mean nothing to the overall story. However, that is often not the case with old Asian horror films. Another slow burn horror that doesn't really focus on the ghost or the spooky things going on but puts the family up front. Showing you a mother and daughter that just want to live together while showing you parallels to the story of the missing girl's. The scary parts are when the mother loses her daughter and you never know who or what took her at that time (happens often). You can look at this movie in a number of ways and read tons of reviews on it but you won't get the same impact. If your just getting into Asian horror I recommend it to see what a good horror story feels like. No reason to say more then that.",positive
"All I can say is I saw this at a midnight showing, late into the Seattle Film Fest.  The general rule with midnights is  give it 15 minutes and then they start leaving in dribs and drabs until only a small contingent is left - most of them because they are sound asleep.  All I can say is NOBODY LEFT!The kind of subtle,  creepy that I love.  You don't need guts and gore, a red hello kitty bag, or a hair in a glass of water is all it takes.",positive
"""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" or ""Dark Water"" is the first movie of Dark Water three years before the American version and I have to say that this movie is really better than the American version. This version has more suspense, action and is more creepy than the American and I believe that it's also the definition of a horror movie.After ""The Ring"", ""The Ring 2"", ""Grudge"" and more Japanese movies (or based on Japan culture) we watch this one. First of all the whole movie is based on the novel of Kôji Suzuki which is really impressive. Secondly Hideo Nakata did a great job in the direction of this movie. Thirdly the interpretations of Hitomi Kuroki who plays as Yoshimi Matsubara was magnificent and Rio Kanno who played as Ikuko Matsubara when she was 6 years old is outstanding.Finally I have to say that ""Dark Water"" is a really nice horror movie which has to give you and it can transfer to us many feelings from the actors and that is something that direction and especially Hideo Nakata did a very good job under the guidance of course of Kôji Suzuki.",positive
"I loved ""Ringu"" and enjoyed ""Ringu 2"" but ""Dark Water"" pales in comparison to both movies.The problem lies with the source material rather than with the direction IMHO. Nakata does manage to create a wonderful atmosphere but he's got very little to work with.The story doesn't catch your imagination as well as ""Ring"" does. It's too simplistic, too linear and doesn't have enough of a shock value to really keep you gripped.** Spoilers **I really thought the bath-tub scene would rival the T.V. scene from ""Ringu"", ghost/child appearing out of it slowly, but it went the other way and missed an opportunity to really scare!It's also *very* similar to ""Ringu"" in basic plot: dead child, watery grave, follow the clues to solve the mystery...** End Spoilers **Suzuki has been described as Japan's version of Stephen King, well in movie terms I suppose ""Dark Water"" could best described as ""It"" as opposed to ""Misery"".",negative
"Inexplicable, and ultimately terrifying, events plague a mother (Hitomi Kuroki) involved in a bitter divorce and her young daughter (Rio Kanno) after they move into a run-down apartment building. The film is an effective psychological horror but cleaves too closely to director Hideo Nakata's previous hit 'Ringu' (1998) to feel particularly novel (especially the supernatural water-imagery). Kuroki is very good as the desperate mother frightened of losing her child, at first to mundane forces but ultimately to the horror that inhabits the building, and Kanno is very low-key and unaffected as her as her six-year old daughter. The film is more creepy than scary and Hideo Nakata makes very good use of subtle changes and fleeting glimpses to build first tension, then fear. My only complaint is his use of some kind of 'psychic-flashbacks' to fill in plot points (I found the similar scenes in 'Ringu' to be the weakest in the film). Although some viewers didn't like the ending, I thought that it was a satisfying conclusion to the story (although some aspects of the closure scenes didn't really make sense). A good addition to the flood (sorry, couldn't resist) of creepy kid films coming out of Japan (and quickly cloned in Hollywood) - not 'scary' but definitely disquieting.",positive
"What is it about Japanense horror directors that they go for long female black hair hung over the face? Is it a culture thing? This film is scary and very sad. The poor daughter who is abandoned by her mother for a little girl ghost. Boy, if it was the directors intent to make me cry, he succeeded. My heart wept for the kid and the mother too. The music is haunting and almost unbearable to listen to. If the American version does not keep the music it will be a lesser work. Not a great film, but a heart rendering one.An unpredictable ending.But, also deeply undeserving.",positive
"A bit of a classic amongst J-horror fans; and rightly so. Dark Water is moody, slow and oh so very sad. Never relying on jumps and instead amps up the creepy factor. It's strengths is in its characters, we spend enough time with these people that we honestly, really start to care about what happens to them.",positive
"I don't know where to start. after watching Ju On and Ringu, this one had me thinking, ""I maybe give this a try."" When i watch this, it didn't disappoint me at all. Through the whole film, its creepiness crept through my skin until the end which nearly got me flying through the ceiling. I was so amazed with it, but i was also sad for the kids, izuko and little miss Kawai.This movie is a definite must see for open minded people.This one unlike Ju On or ringu, no one really dies, except the ghost girl herself. It wasn't really a horror film, much likely a drama due to the mother's divorce case and haunting ghost who wants a mother.The music in the end was very good, but didn't well match to the film itself, i think. I really love it when a movie shows no blood or little blood, and absolutely no gore. This film doesn't have any blood or gore. Just lots and lots of water, yet nothing good to drink.I have to say, Director Shimizu-san from ""Ju On"" and Director Nataka-san from ""Ringu"" and ""Dark water"" both are very respectful directors and i wish i could participate in their film.I'm gonna say this, The Goreless ghost horror films are the only horror films i will ever watch, i wish i can tell the two directors this, ""They have my deepest respect and i am thankful for their films""",positive
"""Dark Water"" is a very effective chiller that takes its time building to a somewhat unsettling conclusion. A young wife and mother is in the throes of a divorce and moves with her daughter into a rundown apartment complex, where water always seems to be dripping from the ceiling. Her soon-to-be ex-husband wants custody of the kid and proceeds to make life highly unpleasant for his wife. Between the constantly dripping water and the husband's antics, our heroine suffers a nervous breakdown and begins seeing a ghost. Or is it? The ending is haunting in more ways than one. The American remake uses part of this ending, and makes an effort to spell things out a bit more clearly. Either version is tragic in its consequences. This is less a shocker than a sad tale of a woman's complete breakdown. Aided and abetted by a ghost. Or is it? See this one. Then see the remake. Both have their good points.",positive
"After the release of the successful ""Ringu"" back in 1998, a new wave of Asian horror cinema began to reach worldwide audiences fascinated by the stylized approach to horror that the Asian mythology and culture imprinted to films. Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand have demonstrated that horror can still be reinvented, as films like ""Gin Gwai"" (""The Eye""), ""Ôdishon"" (""Audition"") and ""Shutter"" have find a very good response (and some of them, like ""Ringu"" for example, have been remade in the U.S. and other countries). Of course, not every recent Asian horror film is good, but ""Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara"" (known as ""Dark Water"" in English), the film reviewed this time, is certainly among the cream of the crop.Based on a short story by Koji Suzuki (of ""Ringu"" fame), the film is about a woman named Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki), who after a bitter divorce is in the middle of an even bitterer legal battle for the custody of her little daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno). After moving to an eerie run-down apartment building in order to have a new start, a strange series of mysterious events begin to happen, and Yoshimi begins to wonder if her ex-husband is trying to drive her insane to recover Ikuko. However, soon Yoshimi will discover that the threat comes from a different source.Directed by Hideo Nakata (also of ""Ringu"" fame) and with a screenplay written by Nakata himself and regular collaborator Takashige Ichise (who also worked with him on ""Ringu""); the film is literally the evolution of what Nakata started with the ""Ringu"" series. The film shares many of Suzuki's themes, mainly the supernatural properties of water and the relationship between a mother and her child, but unlike ""Ringu"", the story of ""Dark Water"" is of a more personal nature. Rather than battling a virus-like curse, Yoshimi battles a supernatural force that's obsessed with her daughter, and so her fight becomes a mother's fight for her child. The screenplay is very well-written, and the characters are complex and better developed; it really shows that Nakata and Ichise have gained lots of experience after ""Ringu"".Just like the storyline feels more personal, Nakata's film-making style in ""Dark Water"" also feels more introspective than in ""Ringu"". With eerie atmospheres and an excellent use of his haunting locations, Nakata builds up a film with an overwhelming feeling of dread and isolation that creates an uneasy feeling of horror. As written above, this is ""Ringu"" to the next level; maybe the film has not many jump scares or iconic endings, but the overall atmosphere the movie creates is a poetic and melancholic image that gives more than a few nods to the Gothic horror of old. The movie moves at a very slow pace (again, a throwback to old school horror films), carefully building the suspense and keeping the mystery until the last minute of the haunting ride.Lead actress Hitomi Kuroki delivers a great performance as Yoshimi Matsubara. She is a very human and real character that not only must fight against a supernatural presence that is set to take the last thing she has(her daughter); she is also a flawed character that must face her troubled life as well as the demons of her own past. As the character that carries the film, Hitomi makes a great job that hopefully will take her to major recognition. The young Rio Kanno plays Ikuko, Yoshimi's daughter, and considering her young age her performance is also remarkable. The chemistry she shows with Hitomi makes the relationship between their characters even more believable, and that's really what gives the film heart.""Dark Water"" is an excellent horror film that gives a new face to the old ghost tales that have become a bit too common these days after the avalanche of Asian horror films. While it's true that at times it lacks originality (becoming a bit predictable), it's beautiful composition and haunting atmosphere really gives the film a fresh look. Many have criticizes its ending, pointing that it's weak when compared to the rest of the film, but I think that despite being a conventional ending, it was the best way to finish the movie.Personally, I found ""Dark Water"" superior to most of the new wave of Asian horror (with the possible exception of Takashi Miike's ""Audition""), mostly because of the beautiful way it's crafted and the haunting atmosphere it carries. At first sight this may seem like a ""Ringu"" clone, but it's definitely something beyond. 9/10",positive
"Despite the acclaims and positive response, this is a very slow moving film that has built a sense of dread on dripping water. I don't like to get wet either, but this is just silly. There are some nice atmospheric moments and the obligatory long hair, unseen faced ghosts, but this just doesn't come together. There are scenes that do work, but the elevator bit was ""borrowed"" from The Eye, and the silent, quick moving ghosts are an Asian ghost story staple. All in all, an unsatisfying experience.For better spookiness and shock, try The Eye or Tale of Two Sisters.",negative
"As this is the 1st Japanese film i have ever seen, i have to say that i am impressed.Hideo Nakata worked as a genius on this film. His visual style is unequaled, without a doubt.A lot of English-speaking residents are put off by films in foreign languages, but after seeing this film, i am thankful that i saw it, and i am inspired to see other foreign language films, especially Japanese films.For those of you who don't like foreign language films, this film (Dark Water) is being remade by Hollywood. It would probably be worse than this original, but interesting all the same.",positive
"I was real disappointed with the American remake of ""Dark Water."" It seemed like it was just about the horror of living in a crummy apartment with a lousy landlord, who won't fix the leaking plumbing.I thought that the original, ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara,"" was much better.The filmmakers of the original understood what makes a creepy horror film. It was filmed much better, had better acting, and creepier music.Also the American remake follows most of the original, but changes the ending. The ending of ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" is the best part.Jennifer Connally was not a good choice for the remake. The main character is supposed to be fragile, while Jennifer Connally is buff. She just doesn't fit in with what the character needs to be.It is obvious that the people who remade ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" had not idea what made it a good movie. Do yourself a favor and see the original.",positive
"I was one of the few people who hated 'Ringu', the sequel, the prequel and the remake. I thought all of them were tedious, illogical and (most damning) not scary at all. So I was not looking forward to watching 'Dark Water' as it is based on another novel by the 'Ringu' writer and directed by Hideo Nakata who was responsible for 'Ringu' and 'Ringu 2'. Even so I tried to approach it with an open mind as a few people I knew who also disliked 'Ringu' have praised it. Now I ALMOST feel mean writing this but after the first half hour of nothing happening the movie got progressively duller and duller. 'Dark Water' is such a snoozefest it should be sold over the counter for insomniacs. Granted it isn't as downright stupid as 'Ringu', but the ""mystery"" here is so bleeding obvious that you think there just has to be a twist... but there isn't. The movie isn't helped at all by having such a flaky and unlikeable main character (played by Hitomi Kuroki). I really didn't care what happened to her one way or the other. And the end... well what can you say? ""Anticlimactic"" doesn't even begin to describe it! Now I'm not a hardcore gorehound who can't appreciate psychological horror. One of my favourite movies of all time is Polanski's 'The Tenant', which also features a newcomer dealing with strange goings on and secrets in a creepy building. But that movie, unlike 'Dark Water', is full of suspense, mystery and atmosphere and really gets under your skin. I'm sure that even people who enjoyed 'Ringu' will find 'Dark Water' a major letdown. And surprise, surprise a Hollywood remake will shortly be upon us. Despite the mainstream media hype there actually HAS been an explosion of innovative and imaginative Japanese horror/exploitation movies. Just don't look for it in the trite movies of Hideo Nakata. Instead explore Takashi Miike, Shinya Tsukamoto and Takashi Ishii to name just a few. Those guys are the real deal, and are genuinely pushing the envelope, not just making lame pseudo-Hollywood horror with subtitles.",negative
"Right, lets make one thing clear. This film does not match the intensity or the verve of what the Ring trilogy was. Now that we have that clear lets carry on.****WARNING THE FOLLOWING COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILER****Right from the beginning of the film you know it is from the same director. It once again follows the same style. The story without spoiling it is about a divorced mother moves in with her child to a shabby apartment block.The apartment block itself even though occupied with people looks ominous to begin with. The long narrow corridor lack warmth and the doors of the apartment are metal giving it a cold prison like feel. As you see the apartment for the first time its is devoid of character just dark and foreboding.Throughout the film we learn about the characters and see them develop. The mothers character is complex. A woman of the edge of a breakdown who is going through a bitter custody battle for her daughter. Yet she carries on for her daughters sake. The fact that her ceiling is leaking water and she sees strange sightings of something does not help.The end, when it does come is truly gripping, we learn the mystery of the dripping water and the strange sightings. Like Hideos ring trilogy the film slowly builds to another classic scary climax. Before then you are left in suspense as various thing happen here and there. His genius lies in the fact he could take something simple like a child's bag and surround it with sinister elements. Like the Ring Trilogy the end is of someone making a sacrifice to protect a loved one even though that person will be damned to spend time in horror.Only complaint I have about the film is who on earth chooses the music. It simply spoilt some parts of the film and that person needs to be fired.The ending was fantastic but as already mentioned its not even close to the Ring trilogy. Still nonetheless in it's own right it is a brilliant film which I recommend watching very late at night.",negative
"Dark Water is another creepy Japanese horror movie from the man who brought us the equally scary Ring. Yoshimi Matsubara is a young mother going through a tough divorce, and moves into a run-down block of flats that appears to be haunted by the mysterious disappearance of a schoolgirl many years before....Director Hideo Nakata does not shower the film with special effects and stomach-churning scenes, instead he lets the viewer imagine the terror that is to come, along with capturing the eerie and isolated atmosphere surrounding this run-down building....Hitomi Kuroki portrays the paranoid and worried Yoshimi with wonderful agility, while Rio Kanno is equally remarkable as her cute five year old daughter. Dark Water equals Ring for its shocking and intriguing scenes, as we are taken on a frightening journey of discovery as to why and how this mysterious schoolgirl disappeared. It certainly raises some tough questions that are comfortably addressed come the end of the film....Fans of Japanese horror films (and of course Ring) will not be disappointed with Dark Water. It's another winner from a now legendary director, which is sure to send shivers down the spine to those who have not witnessed this as of yet....Great!",positive
"As the title of my post says, this movie is not a horror movie, and should not be advertised as one. It's a drama about a woman and her daughter in an apartment building while trying to deal with divorce. The apartment above might be haunted, but that almost seems like a side note in this movie. There are maybe two creepy scenes, that's it. It's not scary, the ending is a big let down, and the ""scary"" parts are not scary. I don't know why this movie is so overrated, but it really is not good at all. I rented it with my friends and we all watched in anticipation of something to actually happen. Then the movie was over.Don't expect any ""horror"" if you're going to see this movie, expect a drama with a few scenes of the girl from The Ring standing around not doing anything. That's the movie, I just saved you some money.",negative
"(I read the book beforehand)
The soundtrack, acting and cinematography make this film both incredibly creepy and stunning.
It's one of the better films I've seen in a while although I don't find it to be that scary for a horror movie it was rather eerie, the lingering shots on the water tank, bag and leak on the ceiling (the water droplets clinging on almost looked like eyes I thought) . But nothing prepared me for the lift scene which left me, my sister and my mum devastated.
I did feel like some shots lingered for too long but I really like a lot of the one takes which are mainly in the apartment.I did find the little red bag to be very well applied to the film as it is in the book, and although I believe the imagery of the child in the raincoat to be overused in horror tropes these days I did find it to be the scarier thing throughout the movie.
This is because the coats purpose is to protect the child from water which inevitably does end up killing her, the raincoat is also related back to childhood so to me represents the innocence within her death. She was left alone for probably less than an hour and..... I cant even.
However once she becomes possessive Over the main character in the movie believing her to be her mother, the raincoat is presented to be something that keeps ahold of the main character.
Lingering in the background of shots.
And overpowering sense of innocence yet eerily it isn't because the ghost of the girl is infact possessive and evil, it won't let her go and is constantly following her, the colour overpowers her despite being worn by a mere child.The film is overall artistic and an unique and a well applied take on a popular book.
It is very hard to get just as good a fold on a story as in a film ( which the American remake didn't completely get) but I think this can be compared to the book almost on the same level.
It's a brilliant character driven film and I loved it , the child actress was astoundingly convincing and at one point outshines the adult actress.
Go and watch this movie if you enjoy a more character based film rather than a plot driven film.
It is slow at Times but worth a watch.",positive
"Spoiler Alert I saw this film tonight as part of the Wellington Film Festival. It was quite an experience. The theatre was sold out (about 200-300 people), and the entire audience was completely caught by the movie.. at one particular point (the revelation in the lift, to be precise), everyone, literally *everyone*, screamed. Quite easily the best horror film I have ever seen. Not boo-scary at all; much, *much* better than that.",positive
"In spite of the blatantly overt musical cues, Dark Water still builds suspense to rival the best horror films. The tension was so thick that it made the first 95 minutes feel like 3 hours, and my mind and body were begging for a break from the tormenting suspense. That is exactly how a horror film should be built up.Unfortunately the conclusion doesn't stand up to the hype. Right when the movie appears to reach its conclusion, I expected a couple more scares and then a few calm scenes to conclude the story and wind down the viewer. Instead, it takes us down a 15 minute trip into a bizarre supernatural story that raises far more questions than it answers, all while never providing any sort of conclusion or additional scares.This movie is brought down by an unnecessarily convoluted ending and musical cues so obvious they're cringeworthy. The first 95 minutes are very good, but not quite good enough to overcome its faults.",negative
"Dark Water: 8.5/10The beauty of Asian cinema is the rich detail that most directors from the region put into their work. Dark Water, a Japanese movie, was an example of such. This was horror movie, but at the same time was beautiful. The main premise is that a woman and her daughter move into a new apartment during a messy divorce. The apartment seems fine from the outside, but instead is ageing and not very nice. The tension and horror gradually increases, and most of the the scariest parts of the movie come in simple form. For instance, there is a leak in the roof of their apartment, and water keeps dripping down. The wetness on the roof expands, creating a very creepy shape. I've never been so scared by water in my life, and this all becomes important later. The producer makes ""drip... drip... drip"" insanely effective. Also, there is a small red school bag that keeps appearing after being thrown away, freaking out the mother and viewer. One of the earliest horror scenes was when the mother and her daughter were in the elevator. The mother took hold of her daughter's hand, but when her daughter ran out of the elevator upon eaching their destination, the mother realized it wasn't her daughter's hand. She looked around, nothing was there, and left the elevator a little unnerved. Switch to the supervisor's office, and a screen that looks through the camera in the elevator, and the vague form of a child is there after the two have left. So every time they got in the elevator again, I was creeped out. I don't want to spoil anything, but this is a really beautiful and creepy movie that should be seen.",positive
"I enjoyed the American versions of The Ring and The Grudge and was sorry that I hadn't seen the original versions first, so I decided that I would see Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara before checking out the remake, Dark Water. All I can say is wow, what a disappointment! If this film scares you then let me recommend that you never leave your house, because the real world will be too terrifying for you to stand.To begin with, absolutely nothing happens for the better part of an hour, and when events began to unfold, I was waaaay ahead of the script and the characters, so the big reveal in the final 15 minutes was unsurprising. Oh and a note to the director/writer: water is not frightening in and of itself.And let's take a minute to review our lead. While it was a good performance, I didn't like her character. She was helpless, high strung, dense and slow to act. Her main reactions throughout were shock, tears and terrified paralysis. I thought female characters like this went out with the fifties. The daughter was a little too annoying to bear as well.Let me add that I love old-fashioned, slow moving ghost stories like The Uninvited and The Haunting (the original not the crappy remake), but there has to be a decent payoff at the climax, and some shivers along the way. This movie just didn't deliver these.",negative
"Emotionally fragile Yoshimi is going through a nasty divorce from her husband of six years. She and her young daughter Ikuko move into a new apartment building and try to start over again. Almost immediately, Yoshimi senses that something is wrong. A vicious water stain on her bedroom ceiling is spreading, long black hairs run out of the kitchen tap and Ikuko quickly becomes terribly sick. Are they simply reacting to the stress of their current situation? Or is the ghost of a little girl named Mitsuko indeed plaguing them both?""Dark Water"" is a creepy ghost story with a cold, soggy atmosphere of unrelenting dread. It is also a look at the bond between a mother and daughter and the sacrifices one must make to protect the other. This is really the story of Yoshimi, a woman with a damaged past who is determined to make a better life for her daughter. The ghost of Mitsuko, a tragically abandoned and later drowned young girl in a yellow rain slicker, is merely the catalyst for Yoshimi's determination to face her childhood traumas and take charge of her life once and for all. ""Dark Water"" indeed seems more like a psychological drama than a horror film, but the images of horror are great: a shadow in an elevator, a tub full of filthy water, a muddy corpse, a flooded apartment and a gush of water from an elevator in the films climax are nicely done, as are the creepy yellow-toned flashbacks to both Yoshimi's and Mitsuko's past, which turn out to be quite sadly similar.Not as creepy as ""Ringu"" or as scary as ""The Eye"" but still quite effective.",negative
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Among the 16 movies that I watched during this year's Berlin Film Festival this was the one that impressed me most. Unfortunately though my voting in favor won't contribute to a distribution on a larger scale throughout the world. That is due mainly to the fact that Japanese Cinema doesn't seem to have many advocates: there are some big names such as Mizoguchi and Kurosawa or, more recently, Takeshi Kitano, but most of the rest is either completely silenced or banned from the big movie theaters and sent to smaller arts or repertory cinemas. Maybe the fact that a Japanese film (the cartoon ""Spirited Away"") shared the major prize of this year's festival will slightly change the situation - at least momentarily.""Honogurai..."" is a horror movie, but in contrast to many products of this genre we have  never the sensation of departing from real life here. It is therefore impossible to relax and watch the action just from a spectator's point of view. We are firmly embedded in the story and willing to participate. Thus we feel sympathy with the female protagonist and even become her ally when she is accused of being mentally ill, at the beginning. It seems logical that she is perfectly sane and naturally is in the right when she claims the custody for her five-year-old daughter. She just seems a little fragile, a little lost in this hostile world. But we feel that she needs her child to gain self-confidence and to be able to cope with her life.Then all these strange phenomena occur, the water that is dropping down from above coming from a flat that should be unoccupied, the red child's bag that appears and reappears under the strangest circumstances, the girl that is reported missing and that seems to walk around the dark and eerie apartment house. But everything gets explained and the lawyer becomes another ally of the female protagonist. It must be the ex-husband who is the villain because he wants to drive his ex-wife into madness in order to seize hold of the child.But then all of a sudden there is a deluge of water all around, and fantastic events just can't be explained by pure logic. We now know that the woman, after all, was insane right from the beginning. All that we see on the screen must be a projection of the unfathomable abyss of her mind.For a moment the movie seems to be in danger to slip into madness, too, and we fear that, after all, it is just another trash horror movie. But then a magical time shift takes place and a fifteen-year-old girl appears in front of the same dark building. ""I remember that there was a very brief period in which I was living together with my mother,"" she says. She goes inside, straight to the former flat where nothing much seems to have changed during the past ten years and where even her mother is waiting for her. We share the girl's joy when she sees her mother again. Why has she never informed her that she went on living in that house? We realize that the life with her father hasn't been a particularly blissful one for the girl. And again we believe in the conspiracy theory: This mother must have been silenced by her ex-husband.The climactic moment lasts just until the delusive images disappear and the girl finds herself all alone again. The horror movie has converted into drama: We are confronted with the tragedy of a girl that has been robbed of her childhood and has to cope with life without the consoling assistance of a mother.",positive
"A divorced mother wins custody of her young daughter after a bitter court battle. Together they move into a rundown apartment complex where the apartment is dirt cheap but soon after moving in, they begin to find the unit plagued by water damage. Not just that, but a red child's bag begins to appear in strange places, even after being disposed of. The mother, who is beginning to fear for her sanity after her tough childhood, discovers that the bag belonged to & is the sign of a young girl who has lived in the apartment above them & who disappeared several years ago.Ever since he hit paydirt with RING, director Hideo Nakata has gone on to make several films in both his native Japan & in Hollywood. For years, fans had been waiting for him to return to the horror genre & make another classic, a wish that Nakata had proved too tempted to avoid.Unlike the majority of horror fans, I was one of the few that didn't think that Ring was any sort of classic. Sure it had a couple of great jump moments (particularly that scene with Sadako climbing out of the TV), but it was a hideously overrated supernatural mystery film that had a plot that was obtuse at times & never made any particular sense (not to mention an internal logic that was twisted like a pretzel). However, it did have some interest & the remake was considerably better.With Dark Water, Nakata tried to do another Ring, only with a red child's bag & a flood of water standing for a videotape. Most of Nakata's fans & even some critics who had mixed feelings about Ring were impressed with Dark Water but I wasn't one of them. To be honest, the plot belongs more in a drama film than a straight horror film. Not just that, but Nakata's skill as a filmmaker isn't entirely consistent – his style was crude with Ring, but when it came to making Ring 2, he had improved somewhat. Here, however, his skill deserted him. There are no jump shocks & Nakata's constant use of the red bag's ghostly appearances was a poor attempt at providing tension.When it came to the ending, Nakata does the same sort of foolish mistake that M. Night Shyamalan did for his films & throws in an end twist that makes no sense whatsoever. I'll explain the following – the girl fell into the water tower & drowned (something that went unnoticed by anyone else despite the girl living in the building & which was never investigated) & haunted the building ever since. Her apartment's kitchen taps were turned on & left on for at least six months, resulting in the apartment being flooded (how on Earth does an apartment become flooded without anyone noticing for six months? Doesn't make sense to me either), which resulted in the water damage to the heroine's apartment. Not just that, but the ghost's red bag keeps reappearing in places despite being dropped into the water originally by the girl herself. And how does the drinking water (which came from the water tower the girl fell into) become dirty without most of the people living there noticing it. I mean, hair shows up in some of the taps, for crying out aloud! But in the ending, the ghost forces the mother to abandon her daughter & join her in the afterlife for no reason. Really stupid if you ask me.Having said that, the day-to-day drama the mother & daughter living in the apartment go through is okay, although strictly routine. Not just that, the acting is reasonable & has some interest in it (Rio Kanno makes for one cute kid & who would make a good actress when she grows up). The epilogue that follows the mediocre ending compensates somewhat for the weakness of the rest of the film's story but doesn't elevate what is an otherwise unexceptional film.",negative
"Once you've seen Ringu you may hope director Hideo Nakata had more than a spark of genius. Unfortunately Dark Water plays on his natural gift for diluting angst rather than distilling horror.What happened? Seems like Nakata has institutionalized himself: he excavates a little from Ringu, builds up a more sociological story and cooks it for 90 minutes with sentimentalism. Sort of a Night Shyamalan syndrome. Bottom line: Dark Water is well crafted but won't scare you through and beyond, which was the tour de force in Ringu.",negative
"I have been watching a lot of horror movies in my life, from all over the world, and I must admit Dark Water just scared me to death. Very few movies can send shivers along my spine and give me disturbing goosebumps - I am getting physical here but I am really talking about the real thing, that feeling telling you ""OK, I am scared now"" - but Dark Water did. I stumbled on to it on Australian TV one night and since then I can't get my mind out of it. Those Japanese movies definitely work on a different level than any others. Another good example is the Ring of course and Ju-on (the grudge), even though this one is a bit too messy to be as good. No blood, no guts, but presences and silent visions give Japanese horror movies what it needs to be effective. By the way, yes, children ARE scary, I've got a 16-month old who can give me the creeps as well. Keep on watching. Lorraine.",positive
"I know on the subject of the saddest scene in the film, the majority will immediately go for the elevator scene which, granted is TRULY heart breaking, especially when Yoshimi and Ikuko look at each other through the closed elevator doors, both crying, just before it goes up to the top floor, etc.However, for some reason, I keep thinking about the 'final goodbye scene' set 10 years later when Ikuko is 16 - when she returns to the apartment complex, it would seem hoping to find her Mother.When she goes inside their old apartment and everything is just as it was 10 years ago when Yoshimi 'disappeared' (as far as Ikuko was concerned).She looks around the apartment, which seems abandoned and is about to leave when she senses another 'presence' in the room, and turns to see her mother standing in the bedroom looking at her.Once they have talked and Ikuko suggests returning to with live with her again, Yoshima tells her that she is 'sorry, that they can't be together'.Ikuko senses Mitsuko behind her, spins around to find no one there, then turns back to her mother who has also disappeared (to return with the ghost). Again, left alone calling for her mother. Gulp!!! Then the very last shot in the film of Ikuko walking away from the apartment complex - for the last time. It seems that truth of what happened 10 years ago has finally dawned on her and she's all the more saddened now knowing that she and her mother never will be together again, contrary to what she had hoped for.A total tragedy for both daughter AND mother who I felt every bit as sorry for in the painful choice and sacrifice she had to make.Then, that gorgeous piece of music as the credits roll. I saw the film two days ago and that 'final goodbye' scene is still in my head. I think it actually moved/saddened me more than the elevator scene.",negative
"'Dark Water'(Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara) is Nakata Hideo's follow-up to his internationally acclaimed Ringu and Ringu 2. Yes, it's another horror movie and it's also based on a story by Suzuki Koji who wrote the Ringu cycle of novels. Both in style and theme Dark Water is remarkably similar to the previous movies. There's a little girl, her face obscured by long black hair, there's an obsession with water (In Ringu it was the ocean and, of course, the 'Well'. Here's it's leaking pipes and the mysterious Well-like water tower on the roof of heroine Hitomi Kuroki's apartment block.) Nakata also builds on the theme, present in Ringu (the movie but not the original novel) of a single mother determined to protect her child at all costs. In Ringu she was, ultimately, willing to sacrifice her own father. Here she's prepared to give up her sanity. The collapse of the nuclear family runs through all of these films but here it's given center stage and Nakata seems even more concerned with his theme than building up the atmosphere he did with the previous film. This is a character piece, it's more about terror than actually terrifying. Polanski's Repulsion comes to mind. This has the odd effect of making Dark Water strangely moving but not nearly as frightening as you know this director is capable of. The film gets it's tense, creep-out factor from seducing you into really caring about Yoshimi and her young daughter Ikuko (Another great Nakata-directed child performance from the cute Rio Kanno). The film also pilfers quite blatantly from Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now! with it's drowned Macintosh-clad ghost-child. Dark Water then, it's got nothing in it that'll mess with your nerves as much as that scene from Ringu but you'll never look at a leaky ceiling the same way and it's got the emotional resonance Nakata's earlier horror classic lacks.",positive
"Yet another in a long line of J-Horror movies featuring a creepy little girl with really long black hair that covers her eyes. If you liked Ringu and Ju-On then you'll probably like this. Comparing this to those other films, I still thing that Ringu has the best story but this was a close second. Dark Water (Honogurai mizu no soko kara)was the definitely the creepiest in my opinion , hence the tittle of my review. Compared with American horror movies this is completely devoid of any gore but it's scarier then the typical American splatter fest. This movie uses some deliberate pacing but you're never lulled into a false since of security due to the often tilted and askew camera angles that keep you feeling uneasy. The tension remains high even in the quietest on screen moments from beginning to end in this film. Although I can't say that I completely understood what happened at the end from a combination of the language barrier and some very convoluted plot twists....but rest assure it was cool. I highly recommend this to any newcomers to J-Horror that want to see what else is out there beyond Ringu",positive
"MINOR SPOILERSI like a good horror movie and over time I've seen some pretty gruesome stuff. Alone, most of the times, with just one little light to add to the atmosphere. Usually I don't scare easily, but Dark Water really gave me the creeps. I didn't expect it to work that well, judging from the first half. The action develops rather slowly and I had a bit of trouble to adjust to the Japanese language and custom. The strange things that started to happen seemed rather harmless at first. Eerie but not very scary. But the movie gains momentum in its second half. Not just because it starts moving at a faster pace, but also because all the seemingly minor incidents start adding up to something that crawls under your skin instead of punching you in the face, like most horror movies tend to do. Director Hideo Nakata also directed Ringu, another movie that relies on suspense and not on shockers that are heavily supported (if not induced) by the soundtrack. The other similarity is that both plots are classic ghost stories about the restless souls of wronged children. This gives these stories an interesting angle. Being victims themselves, the ghosts cannot be regarded as 100% evil. Maybe we even would feel some sympathy for them, if they weren't that creepy... and angry. Or maybe if Nakato didn't have the habit to leave us with endings that are not altogether happy.I wasn't blown away by this movie, but it was certainly worth the couple of euros I spent on renting it. I'd rate it just over 7/10.",negative
"""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" (aka ""Dark Water"") is by no means a milestone in the Japanese horror cinema. Actually it sort of it a drag - literally.The storyline in ""Dark Water"" is so unfathomably slow paced and it takes director Hideo Nakata forever to tell virtually such a simplistic storyline that it is amazing that four screenplay writers - Takashige Ichise, Ken'ichi Suzuki, Yoshihiro Nakamura and the director himself Hideo Nakata - managed to come up with absolutely nothing in terms of a proper storyline or script that would prove to be entertaining or at least scary. No, instead they came up with a snoozefest of epic proportions.I managed to sit through ""Dark Water"" again in 2019, for the second time since its release in 2002. I can't recall the movie, aside from it being about a family moving in to an apartment complex in which a little girl drowned. That is all I remember from back in the mid-2000s when I watched it the first time. I must admit that my memories were positive about the movie, and they were horribly shattered by the snoozefest that actually is ""Dark Water"". I managed to sit through this ordeal once again in 2019, and I know for a fact that I will never return to watch it again.It should be said that the acting in the movie was adequate, despite the performers having next to nothing to work with in terms of script, storyline and plot. But they could do only so much to salvage this movie.As for the ending of the movie, then it really felt like the collective minds of all four writers had struck a wall and they were bared of all creative ideas and input. Then someone just pulled a random thought from way, way back, and they opted to go with that. The ending to the movie was so ludicrous and horribly bad that it was an insult to all who managed to endure sitting through the ordeal that was ""Dark Water"".If you enjoy a good old fashioned Japanese ghost horror movie, then do yourself a favor and stay well clear of ""Dark Water"", because there are far, far better choices readily available in the same genre.",negative
"As most know, it is the same director from Ringu that directs this movie as well.  It can almost be told by all the similarities and the set up itself. Instead of a well (which was used in Ringu) they use a water tank, the ""ghost"" is a child, the family consist of a single mother and her child (likewise in Ringu it is a single parent..)on with the movie, the movie itself does drag abit but that's to build up the story and to the climax of the movie.  there are a few scary scene's, but most of the others are more of suspense and a lot of help from the sounding effects*******SPOILER*******what's with the ending, that was so sad, it made me dislike the movie, i guessi'm a sucker for happy endings, but hey i can take a twisted ending but this one was just too much, i felt so sorry for the poor little girl, and i'm not even sure if i understand why she chose to leave her daughter*********************a comment to another user in here...you said that asian horror movies are bad?..wow i suggest you become more open minded..and talking about taste....to even mention jeepers creepers as one of the ""decent"" horror movies suggest how your taste in movies must be very FLAWED..lol...i'm sorry but jeeper creepers is a child horror movie, it is such a joke it should be categorized as a comedy movie",negative
"**SPOILER WARNING**This film is absolute garbage as is almost all asian horror that has come out since The Ring! Essentially it's a pathetic attempt at a ghost story with absolutely no suspense, no character developement, poor child acting and it's anti climactic!!! Is there anyone left in the world with taste?! The Ring was a solid horror film with an interesting story and it was very well made. Since then a high volume of absolutely terrible junk has been vomited forth at a frightening pace. If there is anyone out there that agrees, let me give you a few suggestions for ""real"" horror films: Cronos, Habit, Nang Nak, Jeepers Creepers and Frailty. I'm not saying that any of these (except Frailty) are masterpieces, but at least you'll get a solid horror experience and will not be disappointed or want to throw something at your television!! I hope this trend will not continue and I can only hope that some of you agree. Use Dark Water for firewood!!",negative

The pacing is bad, the acting isn't all that great, and there's just nothing of interest anywhere to be found in this movie.Really, if you want something creepy, check out Suicide Circle. If you want a good Japanese movie, watch Zatoichi. Just don't bother with this movie.",negative
"A mother (Hitomi Kuroki) and her 6 year old daughter (Rio Kanno) move into a creepy apartment whose every surface is permeated by water.Director Hideo Nakata had been working in the horror film business for many years and had achieved international success thanks to ""Ring"" (1998) and ""Ring 2"" (1999). With ""Dark Water"", it seems as though the American remake gained more traction; at least, it was the one more readily available in my neck of the woods.Thanks to Arrow Video, the film is back in all its glory. We have some genuinely creepy water effects, as well as a dark, unsettling atmosphere created by an old, prison-like apartment and the endless downfall of rain that makes Seattle look like a desert. Exactly what the connection is between water and Japanese horror is unclear to me (think the shower in ""Grudge"" or the well in ""Ring"") but it is pushed to its limits in this film. Though, as I recall, it may have been pushed even more in the remake (but less effectively -- sometimes less is more).The plot could be a bit tighter. There are flashbacks that serve little purpose, and an unnecessary epilogue that adds about ten minutes of running time and really nothing else. But overall, the horror elements balance very nicely with the mystery aspect: where is the missing girl who used to live nearby? Mix in more than a dab of psychological horror to the supernatural, and you might be left wondering how much is in our heads. ""Dark Water"" is a well-measured recipe of success.The Blu-ray from Arrow Video is packed, simply packed! Leading the way is a new 30-minute interview with Hideo Nakata, where he discusses ""The Ring"", ""Dark Water"" and more. There are a few other in-depth interviews, and even some audition footage to give audiences a look of how casting was accomplished. The only thing really missing is an audio commentary, but for obvious reasons one could not be produced for an English-speaking audience. And my only issue with this release is that the subtitles are white rather than yellow, which makes them difficult to read in certain scenes. But, that being said, it is still an overall winner.",positive

"Divorced parents both wish to have custody of their daughter, Ikuko(Rio Kanno) and this film, from the director of RINGU, shows the mother's struggle to adapt on her own. With a new job and school for her daughter, Yoshimi(Hitomi Kuroki) is able to find a gloomy..but affordable considering her limited income..apartment complex to live in. Yet, something isn't quite right about this floor she lives on and a certain bedroom has this unusual circle of water forming on the ceiling. She discovers that a missing little girl once lived on her floor and that her school bag keeps popping up in places. Tha water tank above the apartment complex might just hold the answer as Yoshimi sees eye-opening revelations when clasping her hands on the school bag. Even scarier, whatever lies within her floor has an interest in getting rid of Ikuko and water is a direct source of her appearing. What is it about water and what happened to that missing girl?More of a drama about maternal love and protection using supernatural elements that a full-fledged chiller. Probably a bit too leisurely paced and quiet for horror fans expecting some ghostly evil child springing from water to kill helpless victims. A large portion of this film deals with Yoshimi's adapting to being a single mother dueling with her ex over Ikuko. Water has really become synonymous with modern Japanese horror as well as the black, long-haired ghost child..both make their appearance in Nakata's film here, but are used more as a story-telling gimmick regarding a dead child who always craved for the maternal love a mortal daughter has and willing to kill to have it. Yoshimi has to make a decision..if she doesn't go along with the child that haunts their floor Ikuko's life may be in grave danger. What hurts this film, I think, is the old Amityville Horror illogic..if a place is haunted, why remain? Why not get out of Dodge while the goings good? Obviously, there are other places to rent and live than just this spooky apartment they are staying. The film does seem to side with the mother as she's looked upon as a rather weak female trying to grow up without the man guiding her steps, looking for work and attempting to remain strong despite the up-hill battle as the father, who is barely seen, represents as great a threat as the ghost child who desires a mother to call her own. He wishes to give a home to Ikuko and has the monetary means to do so..but Yoshimi is seen as a loving mother who just wishes to remain close to her daughter, but finds this increasingly difficult with all that's stacked against her.",positive
"This film was recently remade for an American audience and I wanted to sit down and see the original before attempting the remake. On the basis of this film I'm not going to bother with the remake since the original isn't very good.The plot of this film has a mother and a daughter moving into an apartment building at the same time that the mother is going through a messy divorce. The apartment isn't the best but they take it with the assurance it will be cleaned up. Almost immediately after moving in water begins to drip from the ceiling. Something up stairs is leaking The mother tries to get action but nothing is done. As time goes on stranger things begin to happen relating to water and what appears to be a little girl. Unsure of her sanity the mother begins to investigate the reasons behind what is going on in her apartment and to her daughter.The secret of what is happening and the final resolution isn't anything special. To me the movie is more form over content with a long slow build up to any sort of scares. I wouldn't mind if things slowly built up to something or were creepy, but until the final twenty minutes there's nothing. Oh sure the film tries to be creepy, it practically beats you over the head with manufactured creepiness. Unfortunately none of it is genuine.Worse, much of the character motivation and the final resolution of everything makes zero sense to me. (I want very much to ask a question here but it would give the ending away so I'm not going to do so) This is a semi interesting attempt at a scary movie that feel much too manufactured to be real. So while its got a good last fifteen or twenty minutes its not enough to recommend the film. I'd watch this only if you can't find something else.",negative
"Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) and her young daughter move into a dreary, urban apartment block. Yoshimi is in the middle of a nasty divorce / custody battle with her estranged husband. We sympathize with her, since she seems to be getting slammed from all sides. This, along with Yoshimi's past, somehow make her particularly well-suited for what takes place.Odd occurrences start almost immediately, especially after a large water stain is discovered on the bedroom ceiling. As the stain grows, and drips ever more profusely, Yoshimi is drawn into a mystery that leads to a terrifying, yet poignant conclusion and epilogue.Another classic supernatural horror film from Japan, DARK WATER is Director Hideo Nakata's gloomy follow-up to his RINGU 1-2. Filled with foreboding atmosphere and imagery, Nakata has created another perfectly grim, slow-building creeper. This movie is certainly in the upper echelon of the Japanese ghost stories of its era...",negative
"An absolute nightmare! Its a while since I last saw this and although I didn't remember all the details, i remembered the sense of dread that permeated the film. The horror is on two levels, the first is the terror of the last child waiting to be picked up from school. There is always an element of sadness on such occasions, but here with the torrential rain it is really awful. Then there are the complications and horrors of divorce negotiations, unpleasant anywhere but made worse here with the concentration on custody of the child. Apart from these mundane horrors are those involving water and phantom child appearances. For me water dripping from the ceiling, seeping across the floor and tumbling ceaselessly from taps is an actual nightmare experience and this combined with the worries over the child tip this from horror film into a very worrying area indeed. Brilliantly directed with sound and vision terrifyingly coordinated for maximum discomfort.",positive
"Yoshimi (Hitomi Kuroki) is an out of work, divorced proof-reader embroiled in a custody battle with her ex-husband for their six year old daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno). Eager to demonstrate she can take care of herself and her daughter, despite past mental health problems, she gains new employment and moves into a far from ideal, but cheap, apartment and deigns to settle in.These plans are in jeopardy when the apartment appears to be not all as it seems. Strange damp patches begin appearing on the ceiling, a child's bag keeps appearing inexplicably, there appears to be no other tenants in the building and the people in charge have no regard for Yoshimi's complaints regarding repair. Even the tap water in the apartment is strange, and contains oddities that revolts. Ikuko begins to act strangely, and the custody battle is put into further danger when she begins disappearing at strange hours and plays with an imaginary friend.Without giving too much away, there's some genuinely creepy moments contained in this film. The pattering of feet in the apartment above and quick flashes of an unexplained presence should give a hint that there's no blood and guts contained in this film - and it's all the better for it. The score puts you on the edge of your seat and there's an overwhelming sense of evil and malevolence, however I can't stress enough that there's no real evil in this film. Everything is explained, perhaps explained too much - there was no need for a 'ten years later' epilogue but perhaps this was an aim to redress the balance of despair. You'll either laugh or cry at the climax, but it won't disappoint.Although Dark Water contains some plot filler - obviously written in to pad out the original short novel - the sub-plots give a distinctly human feel to the film, despite the very un-human presence that threatens to ruin both Yoshimi and Ikuko's lives. I haven't seen the 2005 re-make and don't intend to, this version is more than enough.",positive
"Dark Water (2002) is a Japanese movie by the director of Ringu that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a mother and daughter who move into an apartment building. The building seems to consistently experience water leaks. As the leaks get worse a little girl seems to start appearing from the water...This movie is directed by Hideo Nakata (Ringu) and stars Hitomi Kuroki (Lost Paradise), Rio Kanno (Noroi), Fumiyo Kohinata (Beyond Outrage) and Shelley Calene-Black (The Purge Television Series).The storyline does a great job of establishing the relationship and dependencies of the mother/daughter relationship. The cast delivers excellent performances. The settings are well portrayed and the horror elements are solid, especially at the very end. The mother scene at the conclusion of this picture is tremendous. The water everywhere was interesting. There some scenes it looks like random puddles of pee around the ghost girl. There's aspects of this that reminds me of the Cecil Hotel documentary.Overall this is an above average addition to the horror genre that's not elite but worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",positive
"From the director of 'Ring (1998)' and based on a short story by the same author who penned the novel on which that film was based, 'Dark Water (2002)' sees a mother and daughter move into a water-logged apartment that may just be less than ideal in more ways than they initially expect. The film is, essentially, a drama about a mother struggling to raise her daughter whilst undergoing a bitter divorce which sees her ex-husband attempt to paint her as 'unfit' at every possible turn. The picture isn't afraid to sit with its quieter scenes, even though it does sprinkle elements of suspense throughout its entire duration. This allows for a relatively strong connection to form between the protagonist and the audience. In turn, it makes you care about her (and her daughter) when things start to get more traditionally scary later on. The scares themselves are well-paced and executed even better, often genuinely getting under your skin despite remaining rather subtle - or, perhaps, because they remain rather subtle. However, things start to get a bit too over the top for their own good as the affair moves into its final third. Though the way in which its mystery elements unravel is intriguing and ultimately satisfying, the actual horror starts to get more exaggerated than I would have liked it to. The epilogue also goes on for, in my opinion, far too long and removes a lot of the ambiguity that the narrative would have had if it stopped just that bit earlier. Still, these issues don't ruin the effect of the piece so much as dampen it. For the vast majority of its run-time, this is a compelling and enjoyable picture. It's really good, even if it doesn't quite stick its landing. 7/10.",positive
"A mother has just gone through a difficult divorce and is now fighting for the custody of her young daughter. This is really eating her up, but also causing havoc is the apartment building is leaking water and some strange things are occurring involving a small child's red bag.Well, I found this film to be quite unsatisfying as a whole and rather ordinary. Maybe I was expecting too much. Since such other Asian horror films I saw, I didn't really know what to expect or have high expectations and I quite enjoyed them. Though, since now that the genre's popularity has skyrocketed, so have its expectations.For me ''Dark Water'' just came across as mostly empty and with only small patches of interest amongst some dragging scenes. It advantages is that it has a easy to follow narrative and some good character development than the likes of Ju-on and Ringu films, but it sorely lacked the frights of those and it becomes rather foreseeable.The performances were good, Hitomi Kuroki as Yoshima Matsubara as the unstable mother and Kanno as Ikuko, Yoshima's 6 year old daughter who is caught up in the mess of the haunted building. Though, the best and most compelling performance is the apartment building. It's as if it's got a life of its own.The gloomy atmosphere and spine tingling score stood out. The rundown apartment building has a very good atmospheric feel of dread and there are some potent features that are added into the mix. So the setting and mood of the film was fairly superior. It had a few chills, but something just took away most of the uneasiness and surprises it supposedly holds. Maybe it was that this felt more like a story more about family valves and relationships then really trying too get you creep out.The ghost itself wasn't particularly creepy or unnerving and some scenes and ideas started to get too repetitious. Though, you come to except that in Japanese horror films nowadays.But overall, it just didn't deliver the goods for me. As the horror element felt half-baked and the ending was a deflated let down.It's mildly amusing.",negative
"I was disappointed in the American version of Dark Water, so I hoped that this version was better. It was, but only by a little bit. There are some very creepy moments during this movie, however, once again, I was disappointed by the ending. And that failure to stick the landing made me less likely to want to watch it again or recommend it to others.",negative
"Enveloped with a brooding atmosphere that hints at a quietly disturbing dread gurgling beneath its slow-burn narrative, Dark Water is a tale of family, tragedy, isolation & abandonment that's often suspenseful, at times unsettling but never terrifying.The story concerns a divorced mother who moves into a dilapidated apartment with her daughter to begin a new chapter in their lives. But things soon take a turn for the worse when they start experiencing supernatural occurrences that's got something to do with the floor above.Directed by Hideo Nakata (best known for Ringu), Dark Water builds its ominous ambience methodically and that sense of foreboding never really goes away. But it's the mother-daughter bonding that drives this story and there is a melancholic tone to how the entire set of events eventually unfold.The run-down apartment serves as a fitting place for the horror to unfold but it's the slow, controlled camerawork, cleverly chosen angles & slightly diluted colour palette that heightens the creepy vibe. Pacing is on the slow side that may not go well with everyone. But performances are terrific throughout.On an overall scale, Dark Water may not be scary but it definitely has that uneasy aura that keeps you invested in the story. The horror elements pierce through the intimate & heartbreaking family drama in a subtle way and though predictable at times, the film offers an experience that's at least satisfying, if not startling.",negative
"Hideo Nakata must have a fascination with girls and dirty water. He took the world by storm with 'Ring' which involved a creepy girl in a well, and now this. A single mother and her daughter move into a new apartment in order to try and win sole custody of her child. However, she starts experiencing unexplainable sounds and startling visions which questions her mental well-being. An interesting combination, and one that works effectively. Merging supernatural tension with a family's emotional struggle, the symbolism and metaphorical analogies of divorce is apparent. How it can destroy not just the people around you, but also belongings and ownership of possessions. One may consider the ghostly entity to be a reminder of the emotional distress you can go through during a divorce. Other perspectives may just include the fact that she moved into a dilapidated complex where her ceiling is leaking. That's right, two valuable lessons here. Firstly, if your ceiling is leaking...abandon your home and save yourselves. Secondly, if you are running late to pick up your child from school...God damn tell someone! Nonetheless, Nakata directed another chilling horror with many effective camera placements where ghostly imagery can be seen in the distance. Hitomi Kuroki beautifully acted the innocent mother, she held the film together. Really emotional scene towards the end where mother and daughter are separated by an elevator, I felt the feels. Whilst it is a horror, it's not particularly scary. It's more focussed on the family drama. The ghost's motives were extremely ambiguous. At certain points she becomes aggressive and malicious, but her unfortunate demise was her own doing. I'm not entirely convinced that she needed to be the antagonist, particularly during the third act. I can see why, it just felt rushed and spontaneous. Also the last ten minutes could've been cut to make a tighter film. Yet again, another good Japanese horror where the American remake pales in comparison.",positive
"Another very solid horror tale by Hideo Nakata.  Suspenseful throughout, but for those who have seen Ringu a little predictable as it explores similar themes.The performances by the two lead actors are very good, Hitomi Kuroki as the mother struggling to cope with her divorce & Rio Kanno as her young daughter, Kanno is especially good in the final scenes in which she appears. The intensity Kanno shows in the final scenes are rarely seen by actors so young.Many comparison can be drawn between this film & Nakata's masterpiece, Ringu.  Both have young girls, who died before their time in watery graves as the ""evil"" ghost seeking vengeance, both are faceless.  Water plays an important part in both films, more so in Dark Water.  Also both protagonist have their own calling card of doom, Sadako in Ringu had the videotape, Mitsuko has the red bag in this film.A film well worth checking out, especially if you enjoyed Ringu.",positive
"A recently divorced woman and her small daughter move into a desolate tower block. Already distressed over an acrimonious custody battle with her ex-husband, the woman becomes even more unsteady as she begins to see and hear frightening and inexplicable things in and around the high rise apartment. Gradually she begins to realise that what she is witnessing is somehow linked to the disappearance of a little girl who lived in the apartment above.Nakata creates a grimly unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere within the damp and decaying tower block, and the almost omnipresent rain further suffocates both characters and viewer. Kuroki is deeply convincing as the increasingly unhinged mother, clinging desperately to the fragments of home and family, and Nakata has captured an astonishing performance from Kanno as the woman's 6 year old child. Her final scene is heart-wrenching.",positive
"I had high hope for this one. I like Japanese movies, and I loved the first two Ringu-movies. Japanese horror at its best.Now, Dark Water is NOT another Ringu. THis is down right boring and silly and not even a BIT scary. So instead of buying or renting this - go se Ringu again.",negative
"I've seen the writer/director teams previous film Ring last year, and I find this one scarier!This time around its not quite as ""intellectual"" and without a ""witty"" twist ending. This film simply aims to rub you in with fright. Rub you good.
I was lucky enough to see this one at the cinema and I can truly say that I have never felt such a wash of fright and horror ever. It was an incredible rollercoaster of irrational fear. And quite a gruesome tale too.I can warmly recommend this film as a welcome fare away from what has evolved into traditional horror with teenagers and witty punchlines. This film brings back what horror film always should be in my opinion : an extrodinary experience that will scary you good. And the director seems to be in total control of the audiences minds and moods. I am truly impressed with what this film manages to achieve. Allthough it is long ago I saw Polanskis ""The Tennant"" I think they have some similarities in portraying the apartment and letting it dictacte the pace of the film. A very talented director. That said I must admit that the film does indulge in some corny scenes , but that's tolerable and even expected, I think, in a japanese film. And I think that without the cheesy scenes I might just have died of fear.I hope you will get a chance to catch this one in a cinema!",negative
"This film I actually saw after the remake. I obtained a copy and it was awhile before I finally got around to seeing it. I'm a fan of these ghost films from the era in Japan, but I wasn't the biggest fan of this one after the first viewing. This is now my second watch for the Summer Challenge Series over on The Podcast Under the Stairs for the 2000s. The synopsis is a mother and her 6 year old daughter move into a creepy apartment whose every surface is permeated by water.We start off seeing a young girl waiting for her mother. She is at school and it is raining. It shifts to a room where we have a Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) talking to two mediators. She is going through a divorce with her husband Kunio Hamada (Fumiyo Kohinata). We learn through this that she has moments of instability in her past. She used to be an editor for a book company and she had a breakdown while doing this. She blamed it on the books she was reading over and over. Kunio is not playing fair and what he wants is custody of their daughter. It isn't a pretty sight, but also hard to blame him.The film then shows us Yoshimi with her daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno). They are looking for an apartment, which she told the mediators she would shore up this week. Ikuko is is tired as they looked at a few places and it has just been a long day Yoshimi does get her excited about the last one though. They go to a building and it looks older. It is raining outside and they meet with the real-estate agent Ohta (Yu Tokui). Inside we meet the property manager who is an older man by the name of Kamiya (Isao Yatsu).They go up to the apartment and Yoshimi likes it. Ohta is nervous, because he notices a water spot on the ceiling. Yoshimi doesn't notice and panics when she cannot find her daughter. She searches the apartment and then goes downstairs. She asks Kamiya if he saw her and he hasn't. He does see her though on the security monitor. They aren't sure what floor at first, but the display on the elevator shows the top floor. Ikuko goes outside and finds a red bag. She wants to keep it, but Yoshimi doesn't know who it belongs to. It is put into lost and found for the time being.The two of them take the apartment and try to bring normalcy to their life. The following day Ikuko is going to start at her new kindergarten. Yoshimi meets with the principal and watches as he and a teacher scold a child. She then goes to a job interview. It runs longer than she thought it would and Ikuko has to wait. Yoshimi ends up just leaving and we see flashes of something from her childhood. It appears her mother did the same thing to her during her childhood. While she is heading that way, she sees a poster for Mitsuko Kawai (Mirei Oguchi) and realizes that she is missing for a couple of years. Ahead of her she sees that Ikuko is with her ex. She freaks out on him and takes her daughter home.The problem with this is that it gets back to the mediators. More information is revealed to them about Yoshimi. This causes her to break down in the hallway and her lawyer Kishida (Shigemitsu Ogi) must calm her down. He has her come back to his office and explains to her that she needs to keep it together, even when it is too difficult or they aren't going to win.Despite all of these issues with her divorce, there is something wrong with her apartment. The leak is getting worse and no matter how much she tells Kamiya or Ohta, they don't seem to do anything about it. There could be a supernatural twist to this as well as the red bag keeps appearing, Ikuko is talking to someone and Yoshimi is seeing things. Is any of this real or is it just the stress of what is going on in her life getting to her?As I said earlier, I did see the American remake first which I thought was fine, but I wasn't the biggest fan of to begin with. I do have to say that after seeing this original version it makes more sense to me. Where I should lead off here is that this movie isn't overly scary. It is more about the atmosphere with some creepy parts. I do have to give credit there as the aesthetic is a dreary one. It is raining quite a bit in the movie, which could explain the leak in the apartment. There isn't a lot of color, so when we get it, it does pop. That is especially for the red bag we see in the movie. I do have to give credit for these aspects.This film is more about this unstable mother slowly losing her mind. She is going through a divorce; she is struggling trying to get her life together. There is the new aspect of being a single mother. We can see her husband has more money than she does, so she really needs to be careful not to hurt her case in keeping Ikuko. To complicate things, she is taking an apartment that is her own, but it also isn't much in an older building. She does hear running around above her and she goes up there to find the place completely flooded at one time. What is interesting here though is that everything up until that point, aside from her seeing Mitsuko can be explained away rationally. Kishida does this and it is one of my favorite aspects to the movie.I will admit that the first time I saw this movie, I wasn't the biggest fan of the ending. It did make sense though when I thought about it. Mitsuko is missing and left by her family. From what it sounds like, her mother wasn't really there for her which is sad. Her father did what he could to try to find her. Yoshimi seemed to have similar upbringing and doesn't want to do it to Ikuko. She is really the one that gets hurt. She does still have her father who loves her and can provide everything, where Mitsuko is missing that. It is quite tragic.Being that this is the second time I've seen this, I knew the reveal of this movie. It isn't ruined by knowing it. If anything, it added a bit more for me. Like an example of this is when they're drinking the water in the apartment. We see hair come out of the facet. The building is old so it could be explained. There also seems to be the dynamic where it isn't being maintained or cleaned as it should.That will take me next to the acting. I really think that Kuroki's performance is really good. I feel horrible for her as she's going through a divorce, trying to make a good life for her and her daughter. To add on to it, she could dealing with a possible haunting. Oguchi is solid in being creepy. Kanno is adorable as the daughter here. Kohinata is somewhat of a scumbag, but I know that these custody battles. The rest of the cast is good in rounding this out for what is needed.The last thing that I want to go over would be the effects of the movie. There really aren't a lot of them to be honest. They do well in indicating things from the past with the tint and the color of the images we see. I also really like the look of the building that they're staying in. It is a dreary and fits the mood of the movie for sure. There are some creepy images with Mitsuko as well. The cinematography really works for what they're going for as well.Now with that said, this is an interesting movie here. It is a story that is grounded with a woman going through a tough divorce and custody battle. She is trying to get her new life on its feet. To complicate it there is the possible haunting in where she is living. She wants to get away, but that could make things worse for her. The acting is good and the movie just has a depressing feel to it that I dug. I think what effects we get are good. There really aren't a lot of them to be honest. The soundtrack fit for what was needed and fitting the tone of the movie. I would rate this movie as above average. It isn't as good for me as some of the other moves from the J-Horror movement for sure with the other ghost films.",positive
"I appreciate the fact that the narrative herein not only delivers a serviceable horror set-up that would work as an instrument, solely meant to 'frighten' people but the writing also made additional efforts to put forth a commentary on a multitude of subjects ranging from failed parenting to child abandonment.Very thoughtful of them indeed; yet it failed to reach a concrete resolution. Part of the reason being is its failure to preserve consistency in its tonality as well as failing to sustain a perpetual cadence! The overall ambiance is fine though as it does a good enough job to set a specific mood that in return helps us to get connected to the on-screen characters and each of their afflictions and backstories!That being said if you compare this with some of its J-Horror contemporaries (Ringu, Ju-on); it comes off as a respectable attempt at best!To tell the truth, I expected much more out of it!",negative
"Hideo Nakata's ""Dark Water"" is a rain drenched canvas of ghostly horror. Stunning to look at, this film tells a modern-day ghost story.While Asian horror fans will have seen all the trademark ghost cues before (mysterious shadows on black and white CCTV screens, slow moving feet, etc.) this film is so well made, it's an enjoyable ride. While it didn't manage to provide any scares, it's a great tale and well told. Nakata can make even a inanimate object, a red satchel, have an evil, brooding presence.The lead actress in the movie, Hitomi Kuroki, is very watchable as the distressed mother who has moved into the greyest of apartment blocks with her young daughter following a messy divorce. As the film progresses, Kuroki's mental anguish increases as things go from bad to worse.A solid 8 of 10 for visual impact and great storytelling.",negative
"I only found out that this film is directed by the same person who directed 'Ringu' after I watched the film. It all fell into place why the film's atmosphere matched that of it's predecessor. Using water as it's main disturbing element, the director brings forth a dark and dank shooting location within the confines of an apartment building. Whilst watching this film, I constantly found myself drawing comparisons to 'Ringu' simply because the mood, storyline, music and even the conclusion were all too similar. In this sense, the film lacks complete originality. Whereas 'Ringu' managed to rescue itself from ridicule by injecting an urban myth as it's malevolent force, 'Dark Water' has no such luxury. Like a friend commented, this film could've been made as a 45 min Outer Limits episode. If you're a big fan of 'Ringu', you may wish to watch this film for completeness sake. Otherwise, steer clear.",negative
"The experience of watching director Hideo Nakata's 2002 release ""Dark Water"" was a bit of a dubious one upon my first viewing. That much I must admit, especially as a fan of a number of his earlier films. There's a definite air of familiarity for much of the film's runtime that cannot be mistaken or outright dismissed. Familiarity that can occasionally border on frustration in key moments. Why? Well, because this most certainly is a film not unlike others that have come before.Most notably of course being Nakata's own ""Ringu"" (aka ""Ring""), the wonderful and trend-setting 1998 release that helped to usher in the rise of Asian horror as a worldwide phenomena. There's a bit of a feeling that with ""Dark Water"", Nakata was trying to capture that wonderful lightning-in-a-bottle twice after the earlier film's wild success all over the world. And I can't necessarily blame him... after all, ""Ringu"" is probably his best-known and most-appreciated work, and it's also just a darned-fine film to boot. And his earlier attempt to capitalize on its success through sequel ""Ringu 2"" was decidedly accomplished with mixed results. An interesting follow-up that faltered at times and never quite attained the acclaim of the beloved original.The formula's all there with ""Dark Water"" and it's parallels to ""Ringu."" Both are based on popular novels by the wildly talented author Koji Suzuki. Both are centered on a working single- mom protagonist with a young child that is intertwined heavily in the story. Both make incredible and heavy use of water- based imagery. And both are centered upon a struggle against a seemingly malevolent spirit of a younger girl. (I believe the term for these types of spirits is ""onryo"", though I admit I am no expert in Japanese mythology.)One could reasonably argue that ""Dark Water"" is little more than a pale imitation. An attempt to either cash-in on or try to reclaim the fame brought about by the earlier film. But I do think that would a disservice to the movie. While I do have a certain amount of frustration regarding the blatant parallels between the two films, I think that ""Dark Water"" does just enough different and has just enough going for it to not only stand on its own, but to also succeed as a fundamentally solid and often creepy little tale.We follow Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki), a single-mom in the midst of a messy divorce as she tries to build a new life for herself and her young daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno), getting a new job and a new home in a large apartment complex. However, strange phenomena begin to plague the troubled mother... perpetual water leaks from the apartment above, glimpses of a mysterious young child roaming the hallways and her daughter's sudden illness. Soon, Yoshimi begins to piece together a dark and terrifying tale regarding what appears to be the spirit of a young child trapped somewhere in the building... a spirit that may threaten not only her life, but that of Ikuko as well.The strength of the film really does come thanks to director Nakata's keen visual eye and ability to build a wonderful sense of atmospheric horror and for the performances of our lead characters, which ground the film with intimate and highly emotional stakes.Nakata has a great sense of tone, atmosphere and composition. He's a master are slow-build and subtle horror, giving us a tale that very much evokes a good, old-fashioned sense of the creeps without falling back on cheap gimmicks and copious amounts of jump-scares as all too many films do. He also knows how to wonderfully build tension, and through vaguely metaphorical imagery, he creates an adequately chilling world in which the film is based. You'd never think water dripping through a ceiling could be so chilling (outside of the money you'll have to pay getting it fixed), but Nakata makes it work.The acting is also top-notch and is a big part of the film's overall success. Hitomi Kuroki makes for a loving and instantly identifiable protagonist, and even if we haven't experienced life- shattering circumstances as she has, we still fully grasp her turmoil throughout. She's just a darned fine actress and gives the film an emotional edge that is invaluable and greatly appreciated. Supporting roles from Rio Kann, Mirei Oguchi and Shigemitsu Ogi are also very well cast and well-played and help increase the scope of the otherwise very claustrophobic film.However, despite top-notch visual direction and world-class performances, I'd be lying if I said the film was without flaw. It can and does meander at times, while at others ratcheting up the pacing to near break-neck speed. It's inconsistent as a result, and that is a detracting factor. (The climax will sneak up on you from out of nowhere, and not in a good, startling way... more in a jarring ""Whoa, that was way too fast"" kinda way.) And those troubling parallels to Nakata's earlier ""Ringu"" are also where I gotta take off a couple points. It's asking a bit too much of us to not notice them, and it's occasionally frustrating as a result.Still, ""Dark Water"" is a fun little diversion nonetheless. It may not be Hideo Nakata's best work, but it's another engaging thriller from this mastermind of horror, and I can forgive it's (rather large) faults thanks to his grand visuals and the likable actors.I give it a solid 7 out of 10. Worth seeing at least once.",positive
"Water, for once, is used as the symbolic catalyst of evil and death. Blood is off the hook this time, and H2O serves as the metaphor for danger reasonably well. It appears on ceilings, faucets turning themselves on, puddles on the floor, overflowing bathtubs, frequent rain, and a flooded unoccupied apartment room. Someone in authority is forever trying to explain the weirder appearances, and in one case even suggests (ready?) the kitchen faucet was left turned on 6 months ago, and nobody turned it off! That silly line notwithstanding, much of this movie is presented in a fairly eerie and effective manner.I was very touched by the three central characters: the mother (Yoshimi) and daughter (Ikuku) are very real and human; their relationship touching and heartfelt, their danger and the terror they endure from the haunting is downright scary. An object as seemingly harmless as a child's backpack becomes a terrifying threat. The mysterious, enigmatic hooded character sauntering around in a raincoat is sufficiently sinister looking, yet a curiosity to learn more about. The tragic details of this entity are revealed to the audience only when the the characters learn them. Yoshimi, the central character (played by Hitomi Kuroki), is the right choice to build the suspense upon. Her battle with madness in the face of this crisis is well executed, and sets up the story's emotional conclusion logically.The movie is creepy and eerie rather than terrifying, but relates a strange and tragic story effectively. The acting is above par, most notably by the children. The altruistic sacrifice that is made is heartbreaking. A well-told story.",positive
"4 stars just for the main childe actress , she is just amazing ! Actress playing mother , reminds me of
Shelley Duvall in Shining ,same constant big eyes , breathing and the deer in headlights expression ... Can't recommend it at all ...",negative
"In my opinion, many elements of the movie are just like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"". By the way, I think those 2 films are better than this one. It's not scary a lot, the storyline is just ok (I would say basic).",negative
"Although I gave both films the same mark, I would have to say that Dark Water is better than The Ring.  There is genuine sadness and caring for the characters. The subtleness of the ""thrill"" will remind you of the Sixth Sense. Really a great movie.  Unusual in the decisions made by the lead character, the mother, sets the film apart from what you expect in American film fare. These folks make better thriller/horror films than are made in the States.  There is much more imagination.",positive
I about turned this one off about 5 times. How people are so enamored with this film is beyond me. The mom is a complete spaz. Off the wall looney and helpless. Very slow moving film. Just drags on amd on. Very disappointing film.,negative
"Yoshimi Matsubara (Kuroki) is a newly divorced mother that moves into an old apartment with her six-year-old daughter Ikuko (Kanno) where creepy things begin happening, which include a strange little girl and a water leakage from the ceiling. Falls into many ghost story clichés, but director Hideo Nakata executes the development and scares wonderfully. The tension builds to a satisfying conclusion, but the conclusion story-wise is a bit of a disappointment; specifically the film's obvious theme of water that seems all unnecessary when the film finally ends. Most people will see it for the scares, and they will be most satisfied.*** (out of four)",positive
I am a huge fan of J-Horror movies having seen the best and worst the genre has to offer I was expecting this to be among the best of J-Horror movies seeing as it is a Hideo Nakata movie but I personally found it to be a little too predicable with it's plot and the movies third act pay off was a little disappointing not adding any real resolution to the story much is left unanswered the back story of the evil spirit is never really explored the evil child spirit we are meant to feel sorry for lacks any real character personality so it's hard to feel anything towards a character that is given no personality or individuality and exists purely as the movies evil spirit that we are meant to be afraid of sure there's some creepy scene's with the spirt running around and the slow build up is enjoyable and dramatic but you expect to learn something about the spirit by the end of the movie instead it just rushes to the end with cheap scares and gives a lame and plot hole filled ending.The movie looks great and is very well directed using it's environment's effectively giving a unique and memorable atmospheric experience throughout the movie that makes you feel like your in a cold and damp environment by using effective sound effects of water drops and cold winds the grey and bland colours throughout the movie really add to the feeling of a dark cold and wet environment that is quiet and atmospheric where all sounds are amplified and hit your ears like a loud drum beat putting you on edge.I recommend this movie to any fan of J-Horror movies while I personally had a few issues with the movie it is praised as one of the best Ghost/Evil Spirit movies ever made so your experience may be different either way it is worth watching and is certainly a beautifully shot and directed movie worthy of praise.,negative
"""Dark Water"" is one of the movies from the recent Japanese boom of horror movies. It's not as original as ""Ringu"" but it's still one hour and a half of reasonably scary entertainment. The story is a simple haunted house one, nothing we haven't seen before in other words. Pretty creepy sound effects and outstanding performances from the actors make this better than it's Hollywood competitors. Rio Kanno is particularly great as Ikuko and Hitomi Kuroki is good as the mother, Yoshimi. The ending is actually quite redeeming, but the reason behind the haunting was explained to early and made the movie much less mystical. Pretty but not very original camera work helps to make it all a bit creepier. Unfortunately there's a bit to little scary moments in it all. You're seldom in an @rsecleansingly scary situation. If you want to be really scared, do like me and watch it in the middle of the night alone, it helps a bit.Overall, this is pretty good entertainment, and it works a dark night but it's nothing special really.5/10",negative
"I watched this movie based on all the excellent reviews and kept waiting for something to happen. Something does, much too late to make a difference, but otherwise, as has been pointed out about the remake, this is largely a portrait of a mother fighting for custody during a divorce and it's hard to tell sometimes what is real and what is a metaphor for her anxiety. It doesn't help that sometimes she reacts in ways which in real life would be over the top and probably make things worse (in acting terms, her behavior lacks motivation). So it's hard at times to sympathize with her. The most suspenseful aspect of the movie is the ubiquitous water, which leaves you wondering why a mother taking care of her daughter and fighting for custody isn't going much further to get the problem solved. As it is, you don't really care, since it seems so clear it's a portentous plot device. When the horror comes, it's a pretty horrible, but almost like it's out of another film.",negative
"I don't know what it is about Asian horror, but it always tends to bore me severely. Somehow it just doesn't strike a chord with me and i always leave the theater wondering what was supposed to be so scary. Dark Water is no different.The story here involves a quite common theme in Japanese horror. Namely spirits coming to haunt people. Maybe the thing about me and Asian horror is that i just can't relate to this fear of spirits that seems to exist in some parts of the world. Here the spirit is first demonstrated by strange water accumulating in the main characters' apartment. Later by other things. And all the while, i think ""This is nicely done, suspenseful. But NOT scary."" And while i can appreciate solid film-making for what it is, i can't help feeling that when i watch horror i want to be scared. And this simply doesn't frighten me any more than most similar movies. I rate it 5/10.",negative
"This was a great movie. I am not normally a fan of foreign films in general, simply because I find that having to read subtitles can be too distracting for me. But this film has made me change my mind. I thought it was incredibly creepy and the attention given to creating a truly bleak frightening atmosphere was right on the money. I saw this film before I saw the American remake with Jennifer Connelly, and I think that the original is much better. Connelly, while a great actress, didn't capture the emotional depth of the characters in the original, and as a result I found the film to be a tedious, boring disappointment. The original story is a haunting, emotional ride that stays with you. Though not what I would call a truly ""scary"" film, I enjoyed it for the attention paid to the character development and the emotional impact of the story of a child gone missing.",positive
I found this a creepy and psychological horror from Japan. It wasn't especially original compared to Ring (1998) but it was fittingly scary. It didn't make me jump but I was grabbing hold of anything tightly so that I wouldn't feel so scared. There was one amazingly scary moment. I found the end part of it pretty confusing although I can excuse that because of all the fear and tense atmosphere that was built up with the sole purpose of giving the viewer some paranoid scary thoughts. Scary and enjoyable.,negative
"As many will be aware, this particular style of Japanese horror cinema became a phenomenon in the west, mostly as a result of the sheer otherworldliness of it in comparison to the kind of horror films coming out of Hollywood at that particular time. For many viewers - myself included - the combination of slow-burning tension, understated performances, emphasis on character and morality, and a more old-fashioned approach to a lingering terror that stresses solitude and eeriness over screaming and gore came as a real relief when looked at within the context of violent, teen-based, self-aware horrors like the Scream franchise (1997-2000), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and The Faculty (1998). It's easy to scoff now, what with the conventions and characteristics of Japanese, and indeed, Asian horror cinema having been co-opted by the west - turning horror traditions into clichés - but at the time, films like Ring (1998), Ju On: The Curse (2000) and Ju On: The Grude (2003) brought horror back to the very essentials; no more satire or irony to kill the mood, just a slow-crawl of inexplicable supernatural horror tied to a fairly pertinent comment on the nature of contemporary Japanese society that elevated the horror, as opposed to detracting from it.Dark Water (2002) was fairly hyped at the time as director Hideo Nakata follow up to the first two instalments of the Ring cycle and the underrated mystery-thriller Chaos (2000). It came at a time when Asian horror had properly emerged in the west, with the American remake of the Ring (2002) continuing the trend of Hollywood ripping off more interesting films from other countries, and turning the slightly silly term ""J-horror"" into something of a genre or a fad. I suppose this factor could explain some of the previously lukewarm reviews of the film in question; with some viewers hearing the buzz or the hype about how great these films are expecting something approaching the second coming. Obviously, Dark Water does work as a conventional horror film, but it takes some cooperation. Remember, we're viewing these films as a foreign audience. They weren't produced for us, or for our particular culture, and as a result they require a certain level of compromise in order to fully appreciate the experience. However, these films fit into a social context that may be lost on a western audience; with the sense of morality and the roots within traditional Japanese folklore really giving a tragic and entirely personal edge to the more recognisable elements of supernatural abstraction.So, what impresses most with Dark Water is not simply the claustrophobia of its images or the constantly overwhelming feeling of loss and disconnection presented by the dreary production design and monotonous use of rain; but indeed, the central relationship between the mother and daughter that gives the film an edge of social commentary and places the emphasis on the characters throughout. It's grown up horror then; a film that suggests the true horror of a mother who can't quite comprehend the inexplicable threat facing her young child, and is forced to attempt to unravel the mystery surrounding the actions leading up to these current events. Japanese horror often has this aspect of investigation, though with the resolution leaving much room for questions and interpretations from the audience themselves. It is fairly slow moving, and does require some level of patience; however, it is worth it for the continually oppressive atmosphere and gradual revelations of the script. Dark Water might not be on a par with the work of director Takashi Shimizu, the most interesting Japanese horror director currently at work; however it does have a great mood, some skillful set-pieces, intelligent characters and an enigmatic final that is open to interpretation.",negative
"This movie ain't worth be seeing! It has been called a ""ghost movie"", ""horror movie"" by other users of IMDb.com , but the truth is I haven't seen any other movie which was so boring. After 70 min, nothing ever happened...just a mother and her daughter in an apartment in which sometimes water floods...nothing scary at all. The last 15 minutes the director wanted to be scary but he wasn't even close. I can't realize how could this movie be rated with 7.1 out of 10. It wasn't a horror movie, a drama, or any other kind of movie. It was just boring! Before I see a movie, I always read the comments which are made on this site but now I am really disappointed.",negative
"DARK WATER / FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARK WATER / GLOOMY WATER'S BOTTOM FROM (Lit) (HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA). Viewed on Streaming. Director Hideo Nakata (also a screenplay co-author) slowly and meticulously builds a scary psychological/supernatural drama for grownups (which means it does not have to resort to blood or gore). This is a tale centered on a multilevel battle over the protection/possession of a six-year old girl. The heavy-duty plot includes: (1) a bitter custody fight over a daughter where the father's game plan for winning is to demonstrate the metal instability of the mother (to a family court); (2) a super-stressed mother (with an apparent history of mental issues due to being abandoned by her mother) attempting to find shelter and re-employment (in Yokohama) with supernatural abilities (apparently inherited) and an overactive imagination; (3) the mother's ""discovery"" of a run-down, virtually deserted apartment house close to a kindergarten school that just happens to have a roomy, under-priced empty apartment in a set up that has her ex-husband's sanity-destroying finger prints all over it (starting with the over eagerness of a real-estate agent and off-putting remoteness of the resident manager (perhaps hired to stage ""mysterious"" happenings?); (4) an apartment house that turns out to be haunted by a six-year old girl who was abandoned by her mother (and is searching for a surrogate) and then, apparently, was abused by maintenance workers and drowned in a highly elevated water-storage tank (on the building's roof); and (5) an erratic, sluggish, and scary-looking elevator in which strange things happen especially at the film's end (there's only one of these in a seven-story building with, perhaps, 60-70 apartments and no freight elevator in evidence!). Nakata ultimately has the mother simultaneously fighting to keep her daughter from the clutches of her sort-of-shady ex-husband and the murderous spirit of the drowned girl. Just about everything that water in any form can do that is disturbing or bad for your mental/physical health is in this movie! A tour de force and a de facto advertisement for bottled water! Not surprisingly, superstitions widely shared by Japanese are cleverly incorporated into the film (perhaps, you can spot them?). Actors are well directed with attractive leading actress Hitomi Kuroki providing a stunning performance (despite being saddled with a wardrobe that does her no favors). Child actress Rio Kanno seems perfectly cast and delivers an excellent and, at times, spooky performance. Supporting male players are very good. Score is chilling. Subtitles are close enough, but you have to turn on the closed captions (CC) function to see them! Most signs/text are translated as are the lyrics of the end-credits song. Fear, dread, surprise, and suspense are generated without the usual phony audio jolts and jump-cut editing employed by movies of this genre. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

"Soon to be remade in Hollywood, lets hope it's better than the abysmal Ringu remake. Taking elements from his previous masterpiece, Nakata presents a story around a single mother going through divorce, and struggling to keep custody of her daughter. However, her struggle to find work, coupled with the fact that she seems, to those around her to be losing her sanity, it seems to be only a matter of time before her daughter is taken. What no-one realizes is that her new apartment is haunted by the ghost of a previous tenant, yep, a creepy little floating girl. Whether the ghost is a malevolent force remains unanswered, and the irony may be that she gives up own daughter, who she has fought to protect, so that she can stay with the lost spirit of another girl, one whose parents could not keep safe. Featuring the same tension in Ringu, although not as powerful, Dark Water is a great horror movie in its own right.oh, the dad is the comedy doctor from Ringu 2. 8 out of 10",positive
"Just want to say that I saw this one in the cinema and it was great!! The movie has a dark atmosphere. It has some good scares and the music/sound effects in the movie are great as well. A very good horror movie without blood and gore but with a good story and an atmosphere which fits well to the movie. Also great camera-angles (close-up of a face who looks at something, but what is it? It must be something scary, then the camera turns very fast at something (I am not telling you what)all together with creepy sound effects). So I recommend this to everyone who likes a good scare. I heard they are going to do a remake but I really don't understand why. This version is perfect, nothing Hollywood can add. Ringu was great as well but I liked this one even better. So go see this version!! Enjoy!",positive
"After Ringu and its sequel in the late 1990s, prolific J-horror grandmaster Hideo Nakata returned to familiar ground in 2002 with this intimate and very scary family drama/ghost story/murder mystery hybrid. Like Ringu, it was remade (reasonably well) in Hollywood – an indication of the central story's universal appeal.While awaiting custody proceedings over her daughter, Ikuko (Rio Kanno), Yoshimi (Hitomi Kuroki) recalls being left at kindergarten while her own parents argued about who should pick her up. These memories inform the whole premise and tenor of the film: Yoshimi is terrified of losing her daughter. So she convinces the divorce panel that she is looking for work and a new home for her and Ikuko. Mother and daughter move into a cheap, brutalist tenement. It's basic but serviceable. Yoshimi gets a job and soon the pair have achieved some kind of normality. But something's not quite right. There's a damp patch on the ceiling and it's gradually growing. And who is that strange little girl wearing the yellow mac? As Yoshimi seeks the truth – all the while protecting her daughter and triggering her own deep-seated fears – she will uncover the tragedy of a missing child that will haunt her on an existential level. As with Ringu, Nakata shows his mastery of the slow horror form, and is in complete control. The frame is drained of bright colour and tinged with blue and grey, almost as if we're underwater. Forget about cheap jump shocks – Nakata is all about presence, subtly introducing us to the layout of the apartment block before planting its corners with half-glimpsed human forms and shadows. Meanwhile, the subtle, eerily ambient score textures the images rather than crashing the cuts. The two main performances are excellent, portraying an entirely believable bond between mother and daughter. Kuroki's performance may aggravate at first – Yoshimi is all nodding subservience and hysterical nerves – but gradually we empathise. As the clouds clear on the mystery of the girl in the raincoat, so they do too on Yoshimi's really quite rational fear of abandonment. While you can see its influence on recent fare like The Babadook, which similarly focused as much on the mother-child dynamic as the scares, Dark Water also owes itself to films that came before. The image of the possibly supernatural, raincoated child, for example, clearly harks back to Don't Look Now; and we even get a final act shock that matches Nicolas Roeg's classic for sheer, lurching terror.Dark Water is deep and foreboding; a bass thrum of a horror which keeps its creepy cards close to its chest. It is intricate and heartfelt and provides pictures that linger. It is also, crucially, an effective and moving love story about family bonds, which is key to grasping the real horror here: the horror of loss.",positive
"From the same director who brought us Ring, Dark Water is from the same stable of recent Japanese horror which is currently labelled Tartan Asia Extreme in UK. But where Ring was new, fresh, sinister, scary as hell, and brilliantly made, Dark Water is a little bit lacking to say the least.A few homages are made to Ring in it, but instead of seeming to be 'trademark' touches, they come across as stale.The actual chills are few and far between. A couple of moments grab you, but for a 'follow-up' to Ring you expect more.And it also commits the cardinal sin of being boring in places too.Ah well.",negative
"I really didn't enjoy the movie. I liked the start of the movie because it was very clear that the mother's life was changing and how much she loved her daughter, blah, blah... The humidity stain... very disgusting, and how it thickened the intensity of the mother's emotions and problems, I liked that. Still I found it pretty easy to guess what happened to the missing girl. And then Boom! they let us see the girl in the tub and elevator, what an unreal monster/ghost! it wasn't scary at all I didn't even jump once. I'm very disappointed in this movie! The which played the mother's role, drove me insane, it was completely exasperating, she was scared before she even saw the ghost, that ""help me, help me!"" face through the entire movie, it just wasn't believable, someone that nervous shouldn't have the right to keep a child in the first place! It's completely unreal to have a stain like that, a constant leak inside your apartment and do nothing about it, that's simply inconceivable! I guess I liked the building, the water, the ghost but just the glimpses of it, not when they showed her; and ikuko's (the little girl not the ghost) I guess she's the only one that played her role well!The story is not developed enough for me, the acting was not that great, but great set designers! There wasn't enough suspense or scary moments for me.I haven't seen the US version yet, but if it stayed true to this one I certainly do not intend to rent it!",negative
"I sincerely think this is the most perfect Japanese ghost movie I have ever seen. I say that simply because it is the first Japanese ghost movie I've seen with such a strong emotional core, and such potential to scare. There are a lot of similarities to Ringu, but I think this may be slightly superior. It also has a lot of similarities to The Shining, mainly with the apartment elevator and the way the story unfolds, but it by no means takes anything from The Shining. This movie may not be wholesale original, but it can stand on its own feet, which I can't say about a lot of movies.The reason Dark Water is so effective is because it understands subtlety. In other words, it understands how to take something that could happen in everyday lifelike water dripping from the ceilingand backs it up with a feeling of terror. I'm the biggest fan of over-the-top violence and punk storytelling you're going to meet, but I can also tell you it's rare than something like that that bashes you over the head is going to scare you. There are some exceptions, but I think that the subtle delicate approach this movie had was more effective in the ability to scare someone. I for one was so terrified by this movie that I almost had to turn the lights onit's been YEARS and HUNDREDS of movies I've seen since something did that to me. There was literally not even a single drop of blood or act of violence, but the subtlety is reminiscent of how we get scared in real life. Slowly. Emotionally.Also, the other thing that makes Dark Water effective is that it doesn't resort to plot clichés or cliché scares. I am the kind of person who sees a little ghost girl and immediately turns the movie off because it's not original enough for me. BUT as I was watching this movie I realized the ghost girl was NOY an added on cliché because the Japanese seem to find them scary, but an actual living, breathing part of the plot. I've always said that it takes a lot of originality to take a genre pieceand Asian ghost movies isn't an underexplored genreand still have something different about it that makes it incomparable to the rest. Dark Waters isn't quite that original, but it's hard to name another movie exactly like it.Once I got to the ending, this movie had me nearly crying. Maybe I'm a pansy and a sap, but I don't think anyone can deny the strong bond between the mother and daughter was not well portrayed. Without that bond, the plot would fall apart. The acting was flawless and the writing was sharp.The only flaw that I've seen people give this movie is the ending or lack thereof. Personally, I love weird movies, and I think the weirdness of the ending was pretty cool and well done. It defied clichés and it was just . . . weird. *Spoilers* I think I like the fact that the ghost was not a killer ghost more than anything. *End spoilers*Does the movie leave you with any idea of what just happened over the past hour and fifty minutes? Nope. And that's why it was weirdly awesome.5/10",negative
"*Honogurai Mizu No Soko SPOILERS* Young divorcée Yoshimi is fighting to get custody of her daughter, but doesn't seem very stable, neither emotionally nor financially (at the beginning, I thought she was insane and didn't like her), and when they move into an old apartment building, matters get even worse.Water starts dripping from the ceiling, a girl's red bag keeps making disturbing appearances, and soon Yoshimi finds out about a missing girl who was the owner of that little bag...I haven't read the book this movie is taken from, but the movie is really good, not metaphysical boredom like 'Ringu', where they CHANGED THE MAIN CHARACTER'S SEX (among other things) from the book - and it felt like a rape each time I watched the movie after having read the book (forego the Japanese movie, read the book and watch the American movie).Back to 'Dark Water' ('Acqua Sporca' ('Dirty Water') in The Italian Edition)... I like it a lot better than 'Ringu'; everybody is in part, the story manages to be sad and scary without it getting gory, or maudlin, or pathetic, and the direction is top-notch.The only problem is the main actress' work in the first half-hour; I believed her to be insane and to blame with most of the things that she accused her husband of, and I didn't like her.Dark Water: 8/10.",positive
"I saw this movie when I was in first year of my college.Eventually It was a rainy night.I could not just move all the time when it was being aired and there after at that night I could not sleep(Really).I can't express what a strange feeling poured my mind.The music ,dialouges,frameshots,lighting was superb.I was not scared but I was amazed how beautifully a movie can be made.This is far better than many Hollywood made HORROR(so-called) movies.I never felt American Horror films enough 'scary'.But found Japanese ones are really scary.It is even better than ""dark water"" and ""the ring""(I mean Hollywood version of both) .I really was thrilled while watching the movie at the time of the scene when the girl returns to their old apartment and talks with her dead mother,at the same time the dead girl also appears on the back with partly covered face.I will never forget this movie which is a must see.",positive
"So whoever reading this review already watched it. Because there is a sign of spoiler.Promising start but failed to answers many questions like, when the girl visit their old home, it was cleaned and everything was there at their positions, no spider net, no dust, everything is quite neat and clean. How? When the mysterious girl and her mother disappeared, why their flat was empty and full of water? Whey their flat was not also same as before? When they both disappeared why there was no investigation to find them? Why no one lives in that house? I have never seen anyone without the caretaker sits all day in the entrance. Why the little girl never died and disappeared instead of her mother, whereas her head was taken by the ghost in bath tub? There are many other questions arose. These are in fact not questions, but plot holes.Overall, it's an overrated horror movie.I just liked the mood. I like Japanese horror movies a lot. That's all.",negative
"This is going to be a rare review, for I have seen both the original ""Dark Water"" as well as an early test screening of the American remake of ""Dark Water"" with Jennifer Connelly. This will be a comparison of the two as well as a standard review.THE SIMILARITIES:Both the original and remake are about a mother and daughter in the midst of a custody battle, and must move into a dilapidated apartment building with a creepy elevator and a water tower on the roof. Meanwhile supernatural occurrences involving water seem to be coming from the apartment upstairs. These strange occurrences start to affect the mother in such a way that it makes her seem too unstable to win custody of her daughter over her competing ex-husband. Both have a similar conclusion to a plot that has doesn't drive the audience's interest other than to figure out what all the supernatural stuff is about.This is where the similarities end. Other than the above paragraph, the two films are written completely different.THE ORIGINAL Japanese VERSION:The original ""Dark Water"" shares the same creative minds as ""Ringu"" and it shows, but ""Ringu"" is far superior. It comes off more as leftovers from their creative process. It's yet another Asian horror film where the ""villain"" is a long dark haired dead girl whose face can't be seen clearly. As the plot unfolds, I get the feeling this film is going somewhere interesting. Then the end comes and it makes almost no sense. I didn't understand the actions that occurred, and when I guessed at what I saw, the motives didn't line up with those actions. It didn't communicate properly to me as an American, nor anyone else in the room with me at the time. There's a sense of a complete story being there, buried beneath the poor communication, but if you asked me what happened at the end, I couldn't say.If you see it, you too will probably ask, ""What's with the neck pinching?"", or ""Why did she do that?"".THE American REMAKE:When America remade ""Ringu"", Gore Verbinski kept the visual creepiness of the original, if not improved it. Instead, the remake of ""Dark Water"" loses some of that visual creepiness the original had, but trades it for a better and more comprehensible script, at least for a western audience. The ""villain"" isn't all that creepy on a visual level. The remake is missing the mark on creating creepy visuals that aren't tired cliché's, like submerged bodies who open their eyes suddenly in someone's daydream. Didn't we just see that in ""The Two Towers"" and ""Resident Evil""? New material please! You know how some cold days have a misty, rainy grayer-than-gray sky that gives you a dreary depressing feeling that makes you want to get as far away from it as possible? Well, the remake has chosen to make that the setting for the ENTIRE FILM! I understand a mood must be set, and it's supposed to be a creepy movie, but does it have to make me want to stop watching the film? The remake decides to focus on the custody battle over the daughter in order to make sense of the confusing ending to the original film. This gets boring early on, yet its necessary to understand the characters' poorly emulated motives and feelings. The writers for the remake have done something clever to improve it. They created a much bigger part for the apartment building caretaker, played by Pete Postlethwaite, who does an excellent job playing the shady suspicious character somehow involved in the mystery. Man, I missed Pete. I was happy to see him.While the writing for the original ""Dark Water"" felt similar to ""Ringu"" or ""The Grudge"", the remake feels more in tune with a cheap, unimaginative version of ""The Shining"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". Where the original didn't make a clear telling of its story, the remake makes up for that...somewhat. However, the remake is overall dull and boring most of the time, and it lacks a clear sense of direction and has almost no suspense until the very end. The first two thirds of the film will make it difficult to answer the question, ""What is this film about?"". A good mystery gives us clear questions to ask that the hero wants to find out. In this case, it's the other way around. The hero seems as though she wants to ask the audience what this film is about, and they just don't know.In summary, the remake is an improvement in script, but a degradation in visuals. It's unscary, unsuspensful and too mediocre to be worth a full ticket price. I'll beat the other reviewers to the punch on this obvious pun you'll see all over Rotten Tomatoes, and say ""Dark Water is watered down.""Original: 5.0 / 10 Remake: 5.5 / 10",negative
"Besides all the psychological build-up - which is excellent - what I found most amazing about this film is the manner in which Nakata makes the drabness of urban Japan look so sinister.  The ubiquitous grey concrete apartment blocks (which become almost invisible after living in Japan more than a month) suddenly look menacing, as much as any run-down Victorian mansion in a more typical Gothic horror film.  Equally remarkable is how he managed to make a primary-school girl wearing a Miffy bookbag - which has to be the essence of ""unthreatening"" - into a convincing evil character.I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and the earlier reviewer was correct - nobody left early, and everyone screamed.  However, the final 15 minutes (the ""10 years after"" segment) belong in another film, and really smack of marketing-by-committee - as though the investors would not release the film with such an otherwise bleak ending.Highly recommended to anyone who has spent time in Japan, and anyone who appreciates imaginative horror vs. the gory pay-off.",negative
"I was told that this film was similar to The Ring, and made by the same director. Well, The Ring was pretty scary but this film never seemed to get started at all.With very few exceptions this film was totally unscary and seemed to relate a divorcée's domestic arrangements. (The very few moments of tension were quite untense too.) I'm usually pretty scared by most horror/ghost films but this one totally failed to frighten. Also, the 'creepy environment' would have been fairly familiar to quite a lot of council tenants.In conclusion I recommend potential viewers to avoid this film.",negative

"I've seen my fair share of thrillers and I can safely say that 'dark water' engaged me in a way that other thrillers tend to miss out.The acting was absolutely compelling and it is very easy to believe in the characters and personally I couldn't help but feel emotionally swept in by both this shocking but very emotional actingat times, dark water may seem long and dull, however this builds up to what I can say is a truly brilliant and disturbing scene...this is the climax to end all climax's, just seeing this scene will make the wait worth while...guaranteed.'Dark Water' may well be the thriller of 2002, with its mind boggling plot, and its great ability to build up tension and keep its audience on the edge of there seats!...if you liked 'Ring' you'll love this one!",positive
"Stephen King bores me. ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" may be (I've seen all the sound and a few silents) my least favorite Mizoguchi. Lately, though, I've been on an unintentional J-horror binge, triggered by my finally discovering how to see ""Kairo."" Search Japan DVD on ebay, you get horror, much of it Hideo Nakata's. Nakata has a knack for missing the best angles within his own films and characters. ""Dark Water's"" had to percolate quite while, before I realized I could keep to my rule by finding good to comment. The film's horror isn't the water oozing like blood in ""The Shining,"" the galloping-pathetic-fallacy rainfall, the reappearing doll. No, it's the lawyers' place, the long confrontational table in the white room, the dark-seeming L-corner around which everyone but the poor mother appears or disappears. The crux of the film should have been here. Take away the supernatural altogether (Is that reunion coda supposed to be a happily nostalgic ending?) and things become more, not less, horrific. Or place the ""ghost"" in the mother's or, maybe even more interestingly, in the psychologically brutal father's imagination. Or make it nothing but a machination of one of the lawyers. Have a lawyer and nobody else mistakenly think it real.Watch with an open mind. While the mother's roaming corridors, let your mind find chances Nakata hasn't taken. Not every dull film makes for a valid exercise, but Nakata's generally do.Horror I like? Cronenberg, Larry Cohen's infants, that first shatteringly unexpected not-quite-off-screen ""Thump!"" in Asami's apartment in ""Audition,"" the child's appearances, especially the first in the restaurant, in ""Seance,"" the Umizaki-trumping entanglement in Shunji Iwai's ""Undo,"" the terrifyingly general phenomenon at the heart of ""Kairo.""",negative
"Like all film industries, the Japanese film industry knows a good thing when it comes across one. In this case, the Japanese have flooded the markets with horror films inspired by the original RING. All the films are basically the same, with a person/persons being haunted by a woman with long dark hair, dark black eyes, and who has a bad habit of appearing out of nowhere. Usually the camera will pan to pick her up, and she'll do very little except standing in the background looking all dark and scary and brooding and such. Not to make fun of the genre, but once you've seen one film, you've seen the rest.DARK WATER gives us a child ghost instead of the usual scorned female. But even our child ghost is a scorned child, so her reason for haunting a mother and her child is the same as the reasons all the other ghosts in the genre has for haunting other people. What I'm trying to say is, you've already seen it. Move along now.5 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)",negative
"This movie did a decent job of building up suspense, bring out the creepiness factor, and portraying the psychological stresses of divorce, parenting, and trying to start your life again. The direction and acting were, for the most part, well-done, with the cinematography on-point.The problem I have is that there's a world of difference between subtlety and out-right incomprehensible choices. In order to create a horror that felt as ambiguous and inevitable as the filmmakers clearly wanted, they had to sacrifice a considerable degree of common sense. Why is the mother, already frazzled and stung, leaving her daughter alone for extended periods? Why does she go racing off alone, and why, when she has someone willing to help her, does she immediately give up when he can't be reached RIGHT NOW!?! Why does a small child disappear and the police never take the time to check everywhere, including the water tank? Why does she quit struggling almost immediately when the dead girl takes hold of her...that is, she just makes a perfunctory effort and quits. Why not, once she's convinced there's something off about her new apartment, flee as fast as she can and hope that the ghost doesn't feel like going all the way across the city to keep tabs on them? Why does she do such an awful job of explaining the issues, and why she feels the ex-husband is behaving badly? Why not make use of the aunt earlier, to avoid issues that complicate the custody battle, like leaving her child alone and untended? What secrets are the manager and the man from the office hiding that they even see the growing water spots and hear about leaks that prevent them from at least doing cursory checks? Why does 16 year old Ikuko behave like she's taking a slightly puzzling tour when she's confronted with a situation that defies logic and rational human experience? And so forth.Just to reiterate -- these aren't instances of basic ambiguity that make the viewer think. They're instances of incomprehensible behavior that make the viewer think the characters are blithering morons. Ambiguity is the question of whether the ghost was truly lacking in malice or had become something darker, which would explain why she took a girl's mother from her, or the motives of the ex-husband or even what the various events leading up to the final encounter in the elevator meant. None of my questions above fall into the same category.It's a well-done movie, in technical terms. It's just a bit nonsensical in plotting and characterization terms on occasion.",negative
"Someone who understands completely the dread a small out-of-focus figure in the distance can inspire, Hideo Nakata is the master of Japanese scary movies.  His latest, ""Dark Water"", immerses the viewer in a deceptively simple story of broken families, lost children and awful apartments.  Our heroine and her tremendously cute daughter move in to the awful apartment, with lazy caretaker and eerie CCTV (a guaranteed spine-tingler in this genre).  Strange things start happening pretty soon, such as water dripping through the ceiling, sightings of a mysterious child in a yellow raincoat, and the appearance, disappearance and reappearance of a totemic red bag, which fills the audience with dread every time we see it.As the domestic drama unfolds, with divorce proceedings, custody battles and the quest for a job, the atmosphere of pure tension builds and builds until a great climactic scene which, in the screening I attended, caused a mass cry of ""Oh, sh*t!"" as we realised the implications of the little girl in the corridor crying ""Mommy""... If that's her daughter, over there, then who's she got in the lift with her? And... relax.  The film's real climax then unfolds, with a strange, lyrical meeting between grown-up daughter and ghost mother.  This, you realise, was the point all along: a mother's love for her daughter, a lost child's need for a mother, a mother's sacrifice to save her child.",negative
"The gifted director Nakata has made a rod for his own back after the superlative 'Ring'; every film he now makes will be inevitably compared to it and be found wanting. He deserves credit for trying to be different - as in Dark Water- even if the film is ultimately disappointing.Dark Water is a subtle film about a mother's love for her child and the nature of sacrifice. However, the film reminded me of 'Ring 2'; it promised much, but ultimately failed to deliver. It's plot was too episodic and frequently relied on momentary shocks (the red bag which keeps reappearing) when the plots appears to sag. The ending was quite sentimental (i.e. the closing music) and I kept expecting a twist of some sort, but this never materialised.There are some good scenes in this film; I particularly liked the dream sequence, where the mother falls asleep and water from the ceiling falls on her. It has echoes of 'Ring 2' about water/mind transference. In her dream, the mother sees the missing child.I found it harder to suspend disbelief for this film in contrast to 'Ring' which was an excellent fusion of urban myth and Japanese folk legend.",negative
"Like Ring this one's a slow burner that builds up a gradual feeling of dread. There are some creepy moments that will give you the willies but one bit in particular that will make you cack your pants (it did me, the first time a film has done that to me since I was in my early teens).
You may wonder whats so scary about water dripping from the ceiling but as the meaning of the water becomes ever more slowly apparant, the dripping water becomes a precursor of whats to follow. The ending was not what I'd had pegged at all and was a bit of a surprise, but it will leave you thinking for a few days after you've seen it and that can only be a sign of a good movie.....",positive
"This movie is entertaining in numerous ways and has many nice scare. I do not find this movie slow pacing at all. I thought it was very well paced. The ending of this movie was very touching and well made. The storyline was decent but there were some plot holes. This movie, unlike ringu, contains both touching and creepy scenes. This movie has much more scares than ringu, cause ringu only has one scary scene. But the scary scene in ringu is much much more frightening than this movie. So overall, ringu was scarier and much more entertaining. The storyline of ringu was better than this. However, although ringu was much more entertaining than this movie dark water, dark water has got very good development of the characters. This movie deals very well with themes such as ""Family"", ""Love"", ""Mother Daughter Relationship"". The ending for this movie was an extremely sad one. There should be more character development for the ghost. Other than that, this is a wonderful movie that deserves to be watched definitely. Score:8.7/10",positive
"You'd think with the talent behind this it'd be awesome but unfortunately it missed the mark. The talent I'm referring to is Hideo Nakata, who previously directed The Ring. It's also based a book written by Koji Suzuki who wrote The Ring.My two main problems with the movie were the characters and the story. Let's start with the characters, they're paper thin. The only two that get develops are the leads and there isn't much to them either. There is a mum and a daughter, the mums going through a divorce and having a hard time that's all you get, you know that she loves the daughter but that's it. There was a perfect point in the movie where it mentions her job but it's swiftly breezed over, I just wanted something to give the character more depth but sadly there was none. Then you get the daughter, she's 5 and goes to kindergarten. I don't mind that she isn't as developed because kids at that age generally aren't, in saying that she does become much more interesting later on. Everyone else is just there, you get a principle who's set up to be mean but it doesn't play out, you get the father in an antagonist role but isn't fully developed or given more than 5 minutes screen time.This leads onto my second problem, the story. It's not overly engaging or interesting until the last 40 minutes. You have to get past the first hour before that though, which mainly consists mention of divorce, creepy apartment, mention of divorce, creepy apartment. Occasionally it'll throw another setting in but it mainly sticks primarily to those two, I can do movies about divorce and hardship but it doesn't even bother to reason why it's happening in the first place or why the parents don't get on. Instead one of the main things the story chooses to focus on is the leaking ceiling, which I get it's called Dark Water so obviously you're going to have some scares around that. It doesn't do anything apart from drip and look dirty though, for the first hour it just drips and the wet patch on the ceiling becomes bigger, great right? It could of focused on the affect it dripping water can have on the psyche, like Chinese Water Torture which is supposed to make people go nuts. It could of don't something around drowning as well as that is pretty frightful in itself but no the ceiling drips.I can deal with slow burning stories if there is something interesting to cling onto but this doesn't have anything, which is a shame as the last 40 minutes are great. Everything is ramped up and the atmosphere becomes creepy and unsettling as well, if they trimmed this movie to around 70 minutes I think it'd work great. It wouldn't be repeating itself every 10 minutes, there are a lot of points where I had to pause this do something then come back because it was that boring. I like to think my tolerance is quite high because of all the garbage I've watched but this one made me rethink it.As I mentioned earlier this is written by Koji but it only adapts the short story ""Floating Water"" from the Dark water book. Maybe there lies the problem, not enough source material to work with, heck I said if it was shorter it would have worked a lot better even as an anthology short it would have been epic.",negative
"Visually and thematically bleak, Dark Water is a creepy, slow building ghost story that effectively uses muted, dreary images and sound to explore the feelings and consequences of isolation and neglect. Grey days, almost constant rainfall, and yellow-tinted dirty water flashbacks characterize the film's pallete while suspense builds in the soundscape as heavy rain gives way to quiet moments interrupted by bursts of atmospheric music and the sound of dripping water.",positive
"Well, as I was watching this movie, a few things occured to me.  Firstly, the pacing and overal atmosphere is very similar to Ringu.  However, I was sure that this would NOT be re-made in the US.  Apparently I was wrong.  I advise you to see the original before an american director wrecks it.  It is quite slow, but the climax is worth the wait.  If you're looking for wild gore and violence (a la Ichi the Killer) pass this one by.  If you liked Ringu, there is no reason you won't get a bang out of this.  One thing I never get tired of in Asian movies is the bizzare directions the plot takes. I highly reccomend this film.  There is something very creepy about movies that focus on the dark nature of children.",positive
"In one of the rare occurrences of the Asian/Foreign --> Hollywood remakes (e.g. The Ring, Grudge, Sommersby), I thought the Hollywood version was actually much better.The storyline was acceptable, although the need for scaring audiences every few minutes has become something of a cliché and the 'scare your heart out' music is sometimes unnecessary.The characters however lacked depth, and with this I could not seem to feel any pity for the Yoshimi (the mom) and Ikuko (the daughter). Walter Salles in the remake managed to take the framework of the story and add more depth to the characters, even the minor ones such as the building caretaker, the estate agent and the lawyer.There were also some unanswered questions, such as the reasons why Mitsuko was abandoned. Again this subject was more covered by Salles' remake.My advice is to watch the remake version first, so you get a better understanding of the original. However be prepared to be scared in typical 'Asian Movie' style!",negative
"SPOILER ALERT - some of the following may have spoilers if you don't know anything about this flick. Proof yet again that no-one matches the Japanese for horror and/or supernatural movies these days. This eerie little flick had me glancing over my shoulder to check that there was no-one there more than once.Although derivative (specifically Don't Look Now) there is much to appreciate here, the slow build - the feeling of dread inspired by an almost missed glance of a shadowy figure - the discovery and re- discovery of a child's satchel, the central character's dignified and compassionate lawyer (!) seemingly being three feet taller than all of the other male losers she has to put up with in the course of a film and, of course, the errant father's complete inability to put out a cigarette. The climax also has a really, really drawn out and intense scare which had my subtitle-hating wife squirming. In lesser hands (dare I say Spielberg and AI?) the coda would have been mawkish and overly sentimental but here it puts the events before it into context and (although it provides an explanation that we probably didn't need) it gives an otherwise downbeat movie something approaching a happy ending.Criticism - the movie could probably have made more of Yoshimi's feeling of abandonment as a child (which is hinted at in a flashback sequence but then never mentioned again - unless I missed something) and her (implied) nervous breakdown to raise questions in the audience's mind about whether what was happening was supernatural or was all in her mind. These are minor quibbles when you compare the movie to most western horror films but they do pull my score down to 7 out of 10. I do however look forward to Nakata's next movie with interest. Overall, if you liked Ring from the same director or Danny & Oxide Pang's The Eye - you're gonna like this.",positive
"I really do. Now I feel ashamed for my doubts I had after 20 minutes of Dark Water or so. There's much deeper plot that it shows at first. And even if you think you know what will happen next, you don't. This isn't some cheesy predictable hollywood trash.And there's scare too. Asian film and/or horror fans be advised not to miss this movie. It's worth it.... Or, you can wait for Walter Salles's remake if you like.Actually the remake of Ringu (which was suprisingly slightly better than the original for me) was my ticket to asian mystery horrors. Since then I can't get enough :)Ringu series, The eye, and now Dark Water. 8/10",positive
"Now that Japanese horror movies are in fashion, any third-rate flick like this one reaps all kinds of undeserved praise.Japanese don't make real movies but rather filmographed manga cartoons, with no effort to build up a logical plot. This was true for ""The ring"" and it stays true for this botched attempt at a movie. It is slow-moving, derivative and entirely devoid of any action. There are very little scares if at all. The plot is extremely predictable and has holes as big as skyscrapers. Perhaps this abortion may appeal to people interested in some tepid childhood drama, but even that is so half-hearted and lackadaisical that it adds very little interest.The only redeeming feature are the performances of the two main actresses. Only recommended to trendy viewers interested in getting all warm and fuzzy with the latest cinematic vogue.",negative
"This is one heck of a scary movie.  A true psychological horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The music, the gloomy scenes, and the great camera angles all work together beautifully to keep the scary element throughout the entire movie.My only complaint is that the ending is sort of weak, but credit should be given to the director for using an unconventional ending.  All in all, not as good as Ringu, but nonethless, this one is a keeper.A 8/10 on my book.",positive
"Saw it yesterday and it scared the living daylights out of me. Because of the atmosphere, yes, but also because of ""Ringu"". I watched ""Ringu"" on TV a couple of months ago, and it was the most horrific experience of my life. And I mean that in the real sense: scared s***less (the topic of Ringu suits the TV-format very well by the way). So scared in fact, that much of the scariness of Dark Water came from anticipation of more of the same. Of course, it's spooky, but not so much as Ringu, because we don't get to care too much about the ghost, since there's only two people being bothered by it. In Ringu, you got the feeling that the tape could be in your mailbox the next morning. And, there you had added suspense in the end: you already knew what had happened, but you still were left in the dark as to how the curse worked. The fact that Dark Water does not have the revenge-theme makes it weaker as well, though the sentimental tone-switch at the end still has me contemplating whether that's a good move or not. Maybe a bit abrupt - suddenly the music swells, and the horror dissipates.The greatest criticism however is the near-identity with ""Ringu"". Not only in atmosphere, because that would still be OK, but also in plot! I mean, the well is placed on the roof, the bloody nail-less fingers are replaced by a swollen child-corpse, we see no face of the girl. How formulaic can you get?Conclusion: it's pretty well done, and when you haven't seen Ringu, none of the above will be of any problem, but if you really want to have the horror creep under your skin: rent Ringu.",negative
"I've seen other movies by Hideo Nakata and this one surely doesn't differ much from Ring, unless it doesn't count that Ring was interesting and pretty unique movie. Imagine Ring with mild and less sinister atmosphere, and replace the scary well with not scary water tank on top of apartment house. A child drowns in the water tank accidentally, and the ghost of the child starts to haunt around the house. This time there is no even special motive to haunt. Maybe in the movies of Hideo Nakata, ghosts just simply enjoy the task? So what, I say. Nothing happens in the movie until it's half. The ending is surprising, but sad and childish. I can't really understand why director had to end the movie like this. Just like in Ring trilogy, no explanation whatsoever is given to the viewer. If the movie would be interesting, the viewer could create the reason by imagination, but this movie doesn't inspire any imagination. I really don't care whatever was the reason at the end. I have better things to do. I would even say that this movie doesn't have a proper plot.Seriously I think this movie would have been much more interesting as drama. The actress Hitomi Kuroki does pretty nice job as mentally sensitive mother who has traumas in her past and emotionally sick ex husband who wants to steal her child. If we forget the artificial horror, putting it away and adding some colour to the film (even if it's left for post processing, but we really need more colour!) it might become a nice drama movie.This isn't even scary. Only in one scene in the movie really scared me. It was when the sick ex husband put away the cigarette to the button of the elevator. There was something really dark, shady and sinister in that. Otherway, I've see the children with long who stands on a dark corridor before. Hmm. when was it last time.. Oh it was in Ring.OK, putting away the lousy horror, the thing I was disappointed was the visual output. The movie should really have a bit more colour, and I've had enough of the ""bleach sky"" effect of this director. When I watched the movie by the DVD, I thought how boring. Almost no colour at all! I understand that the movie was supposed to be like this to create that effect dampness, but I already saw it in Ring and I didn't like it there either.Sometimes the bleach-sky effect can be used in creative way. I like the way other Japanese director Shunji Iwai uses it, creating feeling of nostalgy. Light shining through the screen. But this effect looks like amateur used the movie camera. And in DVD, it looks awful. Also I must complain about the DVD quality, the compression was somehow too heavy and the colours were cutting out.Not exactly my kind of movie experience. I gave 5. However, again I want to say that Hitomi Kuroki was nice and her fans can watch this movie, maybe they can find something nice?",negative
"I didn't find Dark Water as good as it was hyped up to be, yet it was good. The movie centers around a single mother and her daughter moving into a somewhat remote but ""will do"" kind of apartment. From there on things start happening and the girl starts seeing things. I didn't really get much of what was going on in the film, but it did interest me in a lot of ways. It definitely had some formulaic elements in it, but the story was so intriguing I didn't mind it that much. What really impressed me was the acting, especially from the daughter, who did a really good job. This being said, the movie isn't very scary, it has suspenseful scenes and a few frightening moments, but overall it felt like a psychological thriller/drama. I can definitely recommend this movie for anyone who is into psychological movies, as well as films that have well written scripts. My rate is 6/10 Rated PG-13- for terror and disturbing situations",positive
"Yet another lacklustre Japanese ""horror"" riding on the coat tails of Ringu, Dark Water has apparently good intentions which fail to materialise thanks to a script that's dead in the water (hah!).I mean, just how threatening is a damp patch on the ceiling? Not very.I'm trying to think of something positive to say, but I'm struggling. Umm. No, there's nothing. Dark Water is a below average horror movie with no horror, very little suspense, virtually no atmosphere, a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp and all the excitement of a puddle.",negative
"Hideo Nakata's DARK WATER shares many parallels with his 1998 masterpiece RINGU - not least in the storyline. A single mother, battling for custody of her six year old daughter but losing the fight as a result of previous psychiatic treatment, moves into a dilapidated apartment complex and is soon plagued by a constant dripping of murky water from her kitchen ceiling. She also starts seeing a girl around the building - one who closely resembles a long-missing schoolgirl - but is what she's seeing real or is it all a delusional nightmare?I personally don't think Nakata - or anyone else for that matter - will ever match the sheer intensity, suspense and ingenuity of RINGU (certainly not for a while, anyway) and it's unfortunate that his latest effort - also based on a Koji Suzuki novel - has to be compared to that. It's impossible not to, however, and while DARK WATER has a few chilling moments, it suffers from a woeful lack of pace and a rather incomprehensible plot which ultimately result in a disappointing feature. Acting is magnificent, with Hitomi Kuroki giving a performance to rival anything I've seen in Asian cinema as the distraught mother whose love for her child could be driving her slowly mad; and the youngster portraying the daughter is utterly flawless throughout. Nakata's direction is suitably creepy and makes good use of a chilling musical score.To be truthful, though, I'm surprised DARK WATER has had the mass critical acclaim it has. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and plan to watch it again soon but, as a horror movie, it just doesn't deliver.

"Hideo Nakata's less horrific tale of a missing girl. The film is more a drama chiller than a straight horror and the finale is a mind-boggling shock-attack that is, once again, difficult to grasp. The story is about a mother and daughter who move into a flat. They begin to notice wt patches appearing on the ceiling and the mother investigates. The room above is filled with dirty water and according to the owner of the flats, no-one has lived there since the last girl who disappeared a few years back. When the mother takes another look at the room upstairs, she sees a head of a girl peer round the door to the house just as the elevator goes down. Interesting and tense from start to 3 quarters of the way through, then the film turns and what follows is a confusing struggle between the missing girl and the mother. The confusing bit is when the mother holds the missing girl (after the mother has been attacked by her) and says "" i am your mummy"" leaving her real daughter distraught and lonely. 10 years later: the 16 year old girl revisits the house and talks to the mother it is clear she is talking to a ghost but what exactly happened? A film to watch with the commentary on. 8 out of 10.",positive
"Hideo Nakata has finally returned to the horror genre he re-invented with his previous hits ""Ring"" and ""Ring 2"", to bring his newest masterpiece ""Dark Water"". The movie is an adaption of the book by Koji Suzuki (of ""Ring"" fame). Yoshimi Matsubara is in a custody dispute with her husband/a divorce, and she needs to find a place to live with her daughter Ikuko. They find an old decrepit (and very atmospheric) apartment, and since they can't afford anything better, decide to move in. Soon after, water starts dripping from the ceiling, and her daughter begins to act strangely. Yoshimi will soon discover the tragic mystery behind the water...This film was just awesome. It's the only film I've ever seen that can actually be compared to the legendary ""Ring"", and not fail in the process. It's high on atmosphere, suspense, and complexity, but at the same time very beautiful and sad. If you liked ""Ring"", you will love this film.My rating: 10/10",positive
"FIRST OF ALL ONE GOOD ADVICE!Please if your are a person like me :-), who really diggs himself into the story/caracters/details and the great suspence Hideo Nakata createsDON'T SEE IT WITH PEOPLE WHO START TO SAY SOMETHING AT MOST SCARY MOMENTS..or even open there mouths few times in a ""suspence movie"" PERIOD! for me that can infect a movie bigtime. Even a small sentence can disturb the feeling of how you were following the story before.I bet if you see Dark Water alone or with 100% quiet people, lights out, dolby surround for a good noise..and i mean the sound in DarkWater is FANTASTIC it will get you as small as an imp. And you vote a big 8.0!See it the otherway you get comments like this.. mahh it was borring movie, and nothing happend! OFFCOURSE! not, you missed the suspence, by opening ""the"" mouth to much :-), and i didn't say ""YOUR"" gna gna...Darkwater rocked like Ringu.. and if i think back on all the movies i'v seen, can someone please mail or tell me, any movies with the same style, or is Hideo Nakata the only master of this kind of suspence?I'm not going to tell you anything about the movie YOU MUST SEE IT I DEMAND IT!And take my advice for granted, it makes a big diffrence in how you see a movie! Hopefully most will agree :-)I'm satisfied excelent movie!Cheers",negative
"Thankfully I saw this film BEFORE I saw RINGU, as the latter film was by far the better of the two, in fact, I prefer his earlier GHOST ACTRESS over this one. At least in both of those two films, Nakata delivered the chills that this one lacked at the end. Sadako coming out of the set in RINGU and the appearance of the title character in GHOST ACTRESS delivered more scares than the end of this one does with the now- teenage daughter confronting the ghost of her mother in the end of this one. Yes, the buildup was well-done, which is why I gave it as high of a rating that I did, but the ending was a big disappointment.",positive
"Let me start out by saying that I am a big fan of horror movies. I have seen just about everything and have reached the point where nothing really gets to me anymore. Sure, I get a kick out of ""reading"" a movie and predicting the moments where the audience jump out of their seats. But in all honesty - I haven´t been scared in years.When I first saw Ring, my expectations were high. I had heard from friends who had seen it that it was the best thing to come along in many years. Perhaps even the best ever in the genre. On the internet I read wonderful things as well.Here in Denmark we have an event each year called the ""Nightfilmfestival"", where Ring was voted ""best festivalfilm of 2000"". Then I went to see it and... Nothing! Dissapointment! Depression set in! It had some unique camerawork and the cinematography was topnotch, but it just didn´t get to me. Dammit!But now I have seen the light. Hideo Nakata, the director of Ring, has given us ""Dark Water"". If ""Ring"" made you stay up all night, trembling with fear, you should NOT see ""Dark Water"" - it is that creepy! This is the kind of film you go see if you arer a sucker for punishment (The good kind) like me. You won´t find a single drop of blood in it. Nor will you find any scenes involving knives, scissors or guns.Hell, the acting isn´t even that good. But the atmosphere created in this masterpiece is unparallelled. I refuse to give away any of the scenes or in any way spoil it for you. Just go see it for yourselves.But to illustrate what you are in for: remember that scene in ""The Shining"" where the kid is riding his bigwheel around the hallways of the Overlook Hotel and he runs into the twin girls? That was creepy as hell, wasn´t it? ""Dark Water"" is like that for the entire length of the movie! Only ten times as spooky. I am not exagerating.It´s been 48 hours since I saw it and I still have goosebumps.Be afraid - be very afraid...(P.s. Please excuse the spelling.)",negative
"First of all, let me address the neverending comparison of Dark Water to Ringu.  There is a single scene near the end of Ringu that I don't believe will ever be matched when it comes to scaring the living daylights out of me.  I literally moved  few inches in my seat when it happened, and even though Dark Water has some fairly good scare scenes, nothing matches Ringu for that single scene.Having said that, Dark Water is an incredible movie that offers more scares throughout than Ringu did.  From the moment Ikuko and her mom walk into the apartment complex, you know the place isn't exactly right, and strange happenings are thrown at you frequently enough that it doesn't get stale for a majority of the movie.  There are a few choice scenes that made me jump pretty good, and overall Dark Water keeps a consistently spooky tone that keeps you hooked until the very end.  Some people weren't happy with the ending, and I tend to agree that it seems more tacked on than it probably could have.  Having said that, I don't think it took anything away from the film and if anything it offered some closure that you don't normally see in horror films. I would highly recommend Dark Water if you were a fan of Ringu.  Both films are spectacular examples of what movies that don't depend on blood and guts and scores of murdered teenagers can accomplish.",positive
"Not bad at all with a few new good idea's but to bad it is a little bit slow to get start and a much to gentle end, euh i mean after the little accident :) not gone spoil like useal. Another little bit disappointing thing is that it looked like another sequel to Ringu, just that the girl looks younger, but overall the movie is entertaining with a few good scaring scenes but less scaring then Ringu in my opinion, i hope the out coming JUON will be more impressive coming out in January 2003.Oh and by the way, i would like to comment also the ridiculous comment of Jeepers creepers and frailty great movies, euh lol if you compare those to the Japanese Ringu's and same style movies like Phone then you need to learn much more about horror or give at least names like The Shining if you are start talking about masterpieces, especially that i am a big fan of Gina Philips since Breaking Free (main actress for Jeepers Creepers) but was an extremely disappointing movie an really i am defending the Japanese horror because they have new idea's and great scaring scenes in a lot of movies, we need to take some serious lessons, then perhaps we will stop to make such bad movies like Jeepers Creepers but there was worse St-Valentine, this one should win the Oscar of worst of them :)",positive
"I saw this as part of a special screening where the audience had to fill out questionnaires at the end in order for the cinema to give it a 'recommended' star.  I didn't even know what the movie was going to be before it came on.As a fan of the Ring trilogy, The Eye, and Asian horror in general, I was pleasantly surprised to see it was Hideo Nakata's Dark Water.I wasn't disappointed.  This has all the disturbing hallmarks of Ringu et al.  However, it is also a very thoughtful and moving essay on the problems of single parenthood, the effects of divorce on children and rejection.Hitomi Kuroki struggles to maintain custody of her daughter whilst sending her to a school with abusive teachers, trying also to hold down a job.  All the while, the ceiling to her apartment in a run down tenement block is dramatically leaking water.We feel total sympathy for them both as their initial enthusiasm falls into fatigue at their situation.Oh, did I also mention there is also the ghost of a little girl on the prowl.This film succeeds on two levels.  As a social commentary in a similar vein to Urban Ghost Story, and as a truly scary experience.Hideo Nakata uses all the techniques he showed in Ringu to give us a genuinely disturbing experience.  The Eastern style of acting is not to everyone's taste, but it is high quality nonetheless.Disturbing and thought provoking, it will resonate in your mind long afterwards.  Don't miss it.",negative
"The biggest disappointment of this film is that the trailer gives away the entire story, and the only thing that surprises is the coda. 
Good visuals, tho the ""turn...pause...shocked expression!"" was a bit overdone.  Could have used more stingers (re: the calligraphy ghost in ""The Eye"") and a bit more symbolism with the rain.**Possible spoiler** The solution to the story--near the end when Mom rushes into the elevator--could have had more impact if we'd gotten some better exposition on Mom's past.  My first assumption was that she was the ""thinking only of herself"" mother referred to earlier in the film, but the last line of the film revealed I was wrong, and that was disappointing.I still look forward to Nakata's next offering, tho.  :o)",negative
"As with the Ring (which still for me is a superior film) this film takes a while to get going but then proceeds to chill and scare at will. The choice of setting, the cinematography and the performance of the two leads are first class.  The director's ability to spring the unexpected, and create iconic sinister little girls is a mark of genius (although The girl in the yellow mac owes more than a little to the red mac of Nic Roeg's 'Don't Look Now').  More Japanese horror please!",positive
"This is by far a scarrier movie than any of the Ring movies. No gore, no violence,just unrelenty tension and and a sense of doom that starts with the first scene and carries you to the end. The actress who plays the mother is woman really right on. Utterly believable, well paced, gut wrenchingly tragic in her portrayal.",positive
"Spooky ghost story that gets under the skin because of it's touching treatment of the themes of child neglect, parental responsibility, and childhood emotional wounds. Dark water provides some effective thrills, but possesses a richness that is absent from most contemporary horror films. Audiences who are looking for a relentless thrill-ride ala Ringu will probably be disappointed, but viewers that enjoy subtle chills and old-fashioned ghost stories will be delighted.",positive
"The cinematography was well done as was the acting, but the story itself is lacking. It did not make sense and painted the characters as incompetent fools, especially the back-story of the ghost child, the description of her death did not make sense and made the child seem terribly dim witted. I did not find the make-up used on the ghost to be all that impressive and the ultimate outcome of the movie was utterly predictable. The only horror film child I've ever found remotely intimidating or frightening was the girl from The Exorcist. Creepy crab walking scene. Polluted water and a neglected, stupid child are not enough to qualify as frightening. Although, the general idea of strong motherly values was nice to see in a horror flick, but I don't think I would watch this again unless I had to.",negative
"Being an aficionado of Japanese movies, I had high hopes for Dark Water. Unfortunately this movie was a monumental let-down. Nothing really happens until the denouement, it just plods along a very predictable course (the ending being rather contrived too!). The main characters of Yoshimi and Ikuko are acted well enough but the plot is just not that engaging and the effect is that of a monotonous drag. The overall feel of the movie is that of a cheap knockoff, trying to capitalise on the success of Ring (released four years earlier).",negative
"I think that 'Honogurai mizu no soko kara' is better than 'Ringu', I was deeply moved by the story of alone mother confronting a gost/lost soul of a lone daughter. The atmosphere is very gloomy and sticky, the fear of the main character gives you the creeps, and keeps you intense to the very last scene, though you can know the ending in about half of the movie. The music is great and climatic, there's a lot of light work making some shoots very interesting - it's quite a big thing to film a regular building of flats so it looks a lot more disturbing than an old cliche haunted mansion. The ending leaves you with a shadow of anxiety and many thoughts.
That's one of the best japanese horrors I've seen, and one of the greatest thrillers I've ever seen - no wonder holywood is preparing a remake 'cause the idea is awesome. If you like to be afraid - and I mean AFRAID - see this film without hesitation. It simply can't dissappoint you.
-9/10-",positive
"Dark Water is an enjoyable film, but it's not as scary as other Japanese horrors. However, I did enjoy it. Everyone else has outlined the plot so I'm not going to. The ghost in the movie is quite creepy but nowhere near as creepy as the ghosts in say Ring or The Grudge. I am quite interested to see if the forthcoming Hollywood version of this film ups the scare factor any.I think the overall tale trying to be told in this film is that a mother will do anything to protect her child. Which is nice if you think about it.Roll on the next Japanese horror film. I love em. I like American ones too, but Japanese ones usually have a better story.",positive
"Although I enjoyed this film and its story, I have to admit that i didn't really find it very scary. There were a few moments in the film which I found a little creepy, but there was nothing there that got right under my skin and made it crawl. I mean, personally, I don't find water very scary for one thing. Also, I felt that this was another horror movie labouring under the impression that little kids are scary. I'm sorry, but I just don't see what's meant to be so frightening about them. This was a ghost story that delivered little in the way of horror - at least from my perspective. I found the ghost in Takashi Shimizu's remake of The Grudge to be far scarier and more frightening than the ghost in this particular story.Still, although the horror wasn't quite up to par, there were many elements of the film I still enjoyed. The lead performances given by Hitomi Kuroki and Rio Kanno were really good, they really fleshed out the film. The soundtrack was pretty good too. It definitely lent a certain tension to the story.Overall, although I didn't find the film particularly horrific in any way, it still kept my attention until the end. It's definitely not Hideo Nakata's best, but worth watching if you're a fan.",negative
"The wonderful thing about watching a non-hollywood flick is that the storylines are often completely unexpected and original. This movie (aka Darkwater) is a welcome breath of fresh air. Its well acted, creepy and you wont be able to guess what happens in the end. The music, lighting and camera angles are top notch. Its both creepy and utterly compelling. Watch it NOW!!!!",positive
"Seriously, I've got this friend who just loves Asian cinema. Every now and than he persuades me to see one of the many -as he claims- Asian masterpieces. So, after thinking 'Ringu' was a quit OK movie, but really nothing much more than OK, I decided to give this Dark Water a change. But I wish I didn't. It wasted my precious time. Is this horror? No, it's not, it's not even trying to be or even get scary. Is it drama? No it's not, because the story is way to undevelopped to get in touch with the characters. I don't say it's badly acted, it's not the actress' fault the script is lowsy. Is it boring? Hell yeah. We see the same ringu girl but with a different name. Long black hair and too shy to show her face. Next time, it might be a good idea to actually spent 100 yen extra on the hairdresser. Perhaps, they can do something different with the cheap looking haircut than. I'm not used to not sitting movies out, so in being rather curious of what the outcome might be I just waited, and waited and waited. And when it finally came, I realized it was absolutely not worth the wait for. People call this absolutely terrifying. Beyond believe horror. Outstanding film-making. But come'on. This film has basically no soundtrack, no original story, what the heck, the story's just too doll. The style on itself is not particularly special or unseen. It's plane... just ordinary. Nothing big or even remotely masterpiece about this film. I'm getting sick of hearing that Asian cinema is the best horror you'll find out there. I'm getting sick of hearing that films like Ichi the Killer are OUTSTANDING, because they are not. They have lack of story and originality. It's not because it's foreign that it's good. I'm no all American All star, I'm a guy that lives and works in belgium. I like movies. I like good movies and bad movies. And I agree that everyone has his/her own taste. But a masterpiece is a masterpiece. It's about movie making, and storytelling and editing. As I said before. This is plane, and cheap storytelling and therefor I give it a plane rating 5/10. There's nothing that made it bad, but nothing that made it good either. Next time you want to scare me... show me a hairless perhaps even smiling Japanese kid. As I will be surprised, I might be even scared!",negative
"Huge horror fan so if your looking for a horror aficionado's take on the movie then read this brief review Good Story, eeriness abounds, decent scares yet lacking the punch that I neededMore chilling than scary I guess. Read some review so I watched it. Not gonna lie kinda disappointed. Solid story but other horror movies deal with similar themes and are just handled better. very dreary. almost too much. weather is shite in every scene. maybe if the movie was more stylized i would have liked it. Some decent scares but I watched shutter from Thailand the day before and that blew this out of the water in terms of scares. maybe biased on scare factor because shutter was so recently watchedIdk i cant say its bad. its definitely a decent movie but not great.",negative
A good movie. Ending is great. Alot of tension to the build up. Good watch on a long week end.,positive
"This movie is scary in two very distinct ways. One is the main ghost story, amazingly told with a masterful photography and perfect settings. The other is the drama of human relationships and loss intertwined in the plot in such a manner that the outcome is simply perfect. IMHO, the comparisons that some reviewers made to Ringu or even Shining are just plain silly. Hideo Nakata is a gifted filmmaker and have his own amazing style and, if you like the genre, Dark Water is a piece of art that no one should miss.",negative
"Dark Water is a horror masterpiece. It has so many things going for it. It is incredible at building tension. The scares get more and more disturbing until it lets loose an amazing terror at the climax. It also is helped by the fact that the characters are fleshed out to the point where I forgot most of them were characters. The relationship between the mother and daughter is beautiful, and realistic beyond anything I've seen in most movies. But this is a horror movie, and it sets out and performs what it is supposed to do. And the fact that the characters are so well developed makes their situation that much more horrible. Mitsuko is a terrifying presence throughout the movie, and though she is made sympathetic, it doesn't take the horror that she is putting Yoshimi and her daughter through. I was cowering by the time the film reached its climax, and almost crying at the final scene, which is creepy, but mostly beautiful and touching on many levels. Why are you still reading this? Go and watch it(unless you already have)! I can't promise you'll love it, but I hope you do and recommend it greatly from my own personal experience.",positive
"why do movies with scary water situations always scare the crap out ofme? and there's a really creepy kid too - they're always effective ala Children of the Corn, The Bad Seed, etc.......this movie is totally worth watching..and omigod the non-spookykid is so absolutely adorable that i just want to put her on akey ring and take her everywhere with me...(what's up with this 10-line minimum? it just encourages people to babble pseudoauthoritatively about their film philosophies and their knowledge of genre and style as well as to question the integrity of every filmmaker, director, writer, and actor that crosses their paths- hubris, all hubris)",negative
In all fairness my expectations were really quite high for this movie & unfortunately I was left feeling a little disappointed. Everything was was going so well. A totally creepy thriller all be it a little predictable but who cared it was great anyway. Then suddenly without warning it almost turned into a totally different movie. Predictability went out the window and so did any possibility of a reasonable ending. The general feeling in our house was that of watching a good movie crash & burn on the home straight. However for the most part it's superb acting mixed together with classy film making to produce a truly unnerving movie.,negative
The film knows how to build its atmosphere. The mother and daughter make the movie for me. Its very emotional at times. The music was also great. It's a nice spooky little film and I adore it.,positive
"""Dark Water"" the follow up to Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu"" is much better than it's predecessor. Usually, a film doesn't hit me hard enough to make me write a review, but this is one of the few that has. Highly recommended, especially for lovers of bootleg/Japanese film collectors.",negative
"Some people are baffled by this film's ending, by the choice the heroine makes.  But not me.  If you have not seen this film, then I suggest you stop reading.SPOILERSThe heroine decided to ""die"" with the ghost because it was the best solution, in her troubled mind.1.) If she stays in the flat with her daughter, then her daughter will eventually be killed by the ghost (as it had tried to do several times) so that it will have a mother.2.) But if she moves again, she will lose all hope of keeping her daughter, because the courts will see her as unstable.  She is in a lose-lose situation.3.) So she sacrifices herself for her daughter.  Giving peace to the ghost, but allowing her daughter to survive.Definitely an intriguing end to a very intriguing film.  Loved it very much.",negative
"SPOILER-LESS SECTION:This is another excellent film from champion director Nakata. If you enjoyed the Ringu trilogy, you'll love this. While Nakata does use many of the same motifs, for instance a child ghost, focus on a dark, watery place, innocent victims, confused but overly inquisitive divorced single mother, it's in no way a carbon copy of Ringu. Even though Nakata exploits similar methods of invoking fear: for instance, the someone's shocked expression seen face-on before the camera slowly slowly slowly pans round to reveal the source of their terror, and the combination of visual and aural oddities to make a latent atmosphere of fear, these techniques still work, and it's every bit as frightening as Ringu.SPOILERS BELOW!But to its credit, the ending is different, and stunning. While Ringu rebounded from it's false ending with the true ending, where we see the most frightening part of the film, in Dark Water, the true ending is almost devoid of fear. This actually struck me as a happy ending, as the mother's love for her true child is revealed to be so strong that she is willing to give up her life and 'adopt' the ghost girl Mitsuko in order to protect Ikuko from another trademark 'malignant ghost'. This was completely different from what I was expecting, having seen the Ringu trilogy, and as such Dark Water is a fantastic film in its own right.Admittedly, one has a sense that we've seen many motifs and set-pieces before. But the film is unique, although without a doubt Nakata's craft. I advise we set up a TV in divorce lawyer's offices and show this to people who are unhappy with their marriages, it'd be great as a demonstration of why not to split up!This film was doubly good for me as I watched it during a period of heavy showers. Though, tragically, they didn't quite follow the ebb and flow of the action...",negative
"no spoilers, no plots in this reviewjust wanted to say that i probally seen over 1000 horror movies, im a huge horror movie fan, collect horror posters and memorabilia this is one of the few movies that really scared the s*** out of me. one of the best movies i ever seen, sure it MIGHT scare the s*** out of you. but at the same time it's a beautiful movie with an real niceupbuilding suspense, watch in a dark room with good speakers and no talking!in my eyes its perfect i give it 10 out of 10",negative
"The last 30 minutes ruined the movie. The ending could have been much better if the mother saved the ghost instead of being taken by it which makes the ghost who is a victim turned evil for no reason. I mean it died by accident so why become evil and selfish leaving the young child to suffer. It just doesn""t add up.",negative
"I hate saying this, but while I did enjoy this film; after seeing ring 1/2 and ghost actress you realize that there isn't much difference between these films aside from character and setting. Now, this isn't to say that 'Dark Waters' is a bad film at all. If anything, the plot is more cohesive than Ring; and it certainly doesn't lack in mood or creep factor. There are a few scenes that'll have you clutching your cover to your face (like me), at the least Im sure you'll be left cringing from time to time. I've heard mixed reviews comparing the scare factor of this and ring, I'll have to side with the camp that says it really depends on the viewer. I still get creeped out and wonder if Sadako is lurking, but I dont anticipate the same happening with this movie experience. All in all Im fairly pleased with this movie, but Id like to see the writer/director involved with a 'fresh' product. They've mastered this sort of story, and its time to move on.",negative
"DO bother seeking out this film, especially if you think that any film of recent years made in the US is scary. Forget Blair Witch, this is the real thing. All non-stop slow building of tension then no let up at all once he horror kicks in. Again, like Ringu, the sound effects and music are brilliant, and the very affecting storyline as well as being really scary is wonderfully acted and sensitively portrayed. Just a great film, sadly overlooked it seems. Maybe because the original title Dark Water seems to be unusable in the US. Track it down.",positive
"I've had this film on DVD for some time and never had the chance to watch it, but since the new American version is now out i thought i ought to see the original first so i can compare them later on..............its 98 minutes later.....and now i don't want to go to bed or ever see running water or children again. This is a genuinely creepy film, more so than the ring or any of its sequels, ( however good they were ) shivers run through your body when you get to certain scenes....thats if you can keep your eyes on the screen, because the suspense builds so much that you just have to close them for a minute so your nerves can settle down. If the Hollywood version is only half as good as this then it will be a great film. Just one thing though....its best to watch Dark Water with the lights off and with no interruptions. the horror comes from the relentless suspense that builds up throughout the film, and if you are interrupted, then the suspense is gone and you may have just rented scooby doo 2 instead. Lovers of Ringu, Cursed and the like will love this one......settle down and be prepared to get the shivers!! dryadcrow",positive
"I'm a Japanese horrors fan and after I've seen the 7,1 score of this Nakata's work I've decided to buy it. The first half of the film it's a little slow and nothing happens, just like the first Ringu, so I was waiting for the last part. Well this film seems more like a thriller/drama than an horror film. It doesn't scary me for nothing, the acting it's in the average of the Japanese films and the storyboard it's just a deja vu. The story of the little girl that die inside a water cistern and than return in ghost form searching for is mother, recall to much of the sadako story. So if you are looking for a great jap horror try something else (Ju-on, two sisters...). Only for fanatics and lovers of Nakata but I think you will remain a little disappointed after watching this title.",negative
"This is one true blue psychological thriller. one that manipulates the audience's deepest fear without showing much graphic horror. The fear you feel for the 2 weak female (a mother and a daughter) protagonist seeps through the whole movie. If you are a ""normal"" person, you can't help but to feel the anxiety of their safety. This is where the writer did an excellent job. Selecting the weakest gender (frail divorced woman and her child)to create a sense of empathy from the audience to the weak so that your nature of wanting to protect the vulnerable will be at play and pushing the psychological ""fear"" of seeing them in trouble to the tip.Direction of this film shows much of director's understanding of man's psychic. The intense and slow buildup of each scene have an extraordinary impact on the stack up fear factor. I believe it is not the director's intention to develop a twisting plot. (however, there is a slight twist) There are more to this thriller. One that search deep down into our hollowest emotions and thoughts. Rack it up and confront you.
On top of this skillful psychological calculation, what impresses me most is the underlining theme of child neglection. An absolute effective way of expressing the negative effects of irresponsible parents. When you don't take care of your child, what will they be doing? What will happen to them? Such questions keep jumping on you in the course of viewing the film. And even much thereafter. And what is the result? A haunting one.....",negative
"I think it's unfair to say that this film was similar to Ring without pointing out that it was written AND directed by the writer and director of Ring. You think our horror movies are original? I would argue that Dark Water is deeper than it at first appears. You have Yoshimi, a single mother trying to make it on her own in a patriarchy. She's constantly being brushed off or belittled by the men in her life (her ex-husband, her apartment manager, etc.). On top of that, she's being haunted by a ghost child with whom she identifies strongly because of her own childhood abandonment. This film speaks to single mothers everywhere. It's an existential horror in which the scariest part is that a group of people that is growing larger by the day (single mothers) don't have any place in a patriarchal society. If we were all as critical as we pretend, we'd see Dark Water as a haunting and touching multi-layer epic that cannot be coded binarily as ""scary"" or ""not scary"". Luckily for viewers who don't want to have to think about film, there's an American re-make on the way.",negative
"A nice little chiller with a few tricks up its sleeve, DARK WATER brings us more deliberately paced fear and dread in the style of his classic film RING. If you loved that movie, by all means seek out DARK WATER wherever you can (currently available on Import DVD), but don't dive in expecting the same kind of plotline as its predecessor - it's not, but it is just as satisfying.I'm not about to reveal anything of the story here. Let's face it, if you got this far on IMDB, you already know what you're looking for - you just want to know what others thought of it. I thought this movie was fantastic. Very scary. Please go and see it.",positive
"This could well be the most frightening movie I have seen at a cinema. It is a masterful lesson in atmospheric fear, that doesn't have to rely on shock tactics common in most, if not all, Hollywood horror films.  As with Ringu, this Japanese movie draws us into the world of fantasy undercut with an unsettling, provocative tension that doesn't even let go in the film's denouement.  The future of horror lies in the hands of films like these which can fill the audience with a sense of unease which will stay with them longer than the average, mainstream shocker.",positive
"Like so many other Japanese films these days, there's no real beginning or ending. Wonder what that means? Try picking up a random horror book off the shelf the next time you go to the library and read nothing but the middle 3/5's of the book. Translate that into Japanese and chances are, it seems, you'll have a hit film. In English, it's crap.It is, however, very easy on the eyes. The entire script could fit onto three typed pages.It would make for a fun drinking game, though. Take a swig every time the kid's name is spoken. Heck, that's like 50% of the entire spoken dialog.Save your time and money and pick up the American remake. You'll thank yourself for it.",negative
"After seeing the US remake of this movie several months ago, I was not impressed. The scenery was so depressing it was almost overkill, and I didn't think it was very scary at all. That being said, I was a bit apprehensive about watching the original, but I figured I would give it a shot. Well, I thought the original was much better than the remake. The scenery wasn't nearly as dreary yet the tone of the movie was still the same...creepy. I wouldn't say it was super scary, but there were definitely a few creepy scenes. It was also a bit more subtle in dealing with the emotions that the mother was going through, which I liked. I liked the ending of the original version much better, although they were pretty similar. I have also found, as this is the second Asian horror movie I have watched (""Phone"" being the other one), that I don't mind the subtitles one bit. On a few occasions I had to rewind to catch all the dialogue, but that was no big deal. In light of the two Asian movies that I have seen, I am planning to watch several others that I have read about (""Ringu"", ""Tale of Two Sisters""). I would not recommend the US remake of this movie, but the original was entertaining. If you are looking for a traditional horror movie, however, this movie might not satisfy you.",positive
"As with other Japanese horror films I have seen, Dark Water has a slow, subtle build up, introducing the scares and tension bit by bit - there are no big scares early on to set the scene. This is the films strength - it sucks you in, putting you on edge ready for the climax, and what a climax it is! Just when you think you have predicted how the film will play out, all hell breaks loose and you are left a stunned and cowering wreck whilst an equally eerie and melancholic anticlimax brings the film to it's conclusion.This is top notch scary stuff, and I would recommend it to anyone who has been disappointed by the recent appalling non-scary horror that has come out of the US recently. Whoever claimed that Jeepers Creepers was the best horror film in the last ten years should be locked in a small theatre with a dripping ceiling and forced to watch Dark Water immediately.This is pure atmospheric horror, with true scares that do not rely on blood and gore, and the effect lingers in the mind.",negative
"I went into this movie expecting something great, and extremely creepy and traumatizing scary. Instead I just got a bunch of half scare scenes that made me say ""WTF is that it"" I was expecting the scares to be really disturbing and make me jump out of my skin. But instead I was sitting there expecting more to happen but nothing happened. The one thing about this film I do enjoy though, is the plot. I felt the plot was well done and the purpose of the ghost mysteriously appearing out of no where was relevant. I see this film gets a lot of great positive reviews and praise from other people which is fine since that's their opinion. I never seen the American version so I don't plan on comparing the two. I just felt that this film lacked the scares and haunting images you would see in other J-Horror movies like Ringu and Ju-On. Like I said I'll give this film props for the plot, but I'm disappointed in terms of the horror provided in this film.",negative
"Well I have to go against the flow here and say this move scared me more than any film I've seen in about 10 years. I loved the slower pace and the fact that the film didn't constantly pander to its audience by filling every minute with a horrible death or a gory revelation. The movie slowly worked its way under my skin until the final shock scene in the elevator (""MAMA!!!!"") caused all the hairs on the back of my neck to stand on end. I loved this film and bought the DVD as soon as it came out in the States. Blood and guts don't make a film scary. Suggestions of the supernatural into an otherwise fairly un-horrific story can be so much more frightening. I am quite nervous as to what the USA film will be like. I'm not holding out much hope that the true creepiness of the original won't be swept away on a sea of overdone special effects and shock scenes. I am making a point to show my DVD of the original to all my friends before they see the remake and their opinion becomes jaded.",positive
"I don't watch horror movies. It is a simple fact that they scare the bejesus out of me. I wouldn't call Dark Water a horror movie. I would call it a thriller or something like that but it isn't a horror movie. For one, it didn't keep me up all night worried about ghosts of dead children leaping out of my bathtub. I did cry in it though. The ending, poor Ikuko. And the bits with the dead girl made the hair on the back of my neck rise but not send me scurrying across the room. The bit where she jumps the mother was actually kind of funny and slightly disturbing. But otherwise, I thought that it was a sad story and i was moved by the mother's sacrifice for her daughter.Ikuko, i wanted to bundle her up and hug her, she was so kawaii! (cute). and when her mother called her ""ik-chan"", hee hee. ^_^I even felt sorry for the dead kid, she was cute before she turned all algified and stuff, but death will do that to ya.",negative
"3 years ago, Hideo Nakata adapted a novel by Kouji Suzuki, and the resulting ""Ring"" became a huge success, not only in Japan, but also in other parts of the world. It managed to create an extremely spooky ambiance from extremely elaborate camera and sound works, without the trace of a special effect (except the cult final scene, which gave the creeps even to hardcore horror viewers). Well, after a bunch of sequels/prequels and several other ""ring-like"" movies, Japanese and Asian horror has reached its maturity. Time for the original team (Nakata / Suzuki) to reform.""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" (from the depths of dark waters) works on basically the same principles : very slow pacing (just like Ring, the scenario is extremely simple), chilly ambiance, everyday characters rather than heros. As for the story, it is an extremely basic haunted house/ghost story. A divorcing woman moves with her 6-year old daughter in an old (by Japanese standards) apartment. Shortly after they move, strange noises come from the upper floor, and water starts dropping from the ceiling. Acting is efficient, Hitomi Kuroki is an experienced actress, and the supporting cast seems solid to me.As said above, the pace is extremely slow. Do not expect any big plot twists, followed by narrow-streets car chases. There aren't any. But there is no need either. There are some special effects (as the credits rolled, I even noticed a ""Computer Graphics Effects"" team), but hey, dropping water from a ceiling requires a special effect team.Is it scary? yes. As scary as Ring? it depends on the spectator, I would be inclined to say no. Is it a good movie? yes. But it kind of lacks originality (see Kairo by Kiyoshi Kurosawa). It is ""only"" a good horror movie, with an excellent ambiance.",positive
"Maybe there´s not m-o-r-e water in this film than in The Big Blue (Besson). But it´s... darker, and sure there is a lot. Not to mention the water is... alive. Sort of. The suspension grows steadily while the relatively simple story rolls on.I saw this at Stockholm Film Festival, starting at midnight, and it was a thrill! Creepy, of course, but also very beautiful. Excellent acting, not least the six year old girl character.It starts like an everyday drama, about a woman and her daughter in the middle of a post-divorce trauma. It ends like... well, let´s only say Stephen King could have written it (but really not just this good).The movie reminds me vaguely of The Shining, there is also at least one very clear reference to the classic Kubrick movie. But here you don´t have to watch Jack Nicholson. And no blood, just water. Dark water.",positive
"Hideo Nakata is a good director. Although the film is just about ok...not very moving, thrilling etc. The plot is lame and you can predict the end, before you're halfway into the movie.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to a die hard horror freak...but then this movie is not a complete waste of time. The stark environment, the background score..is good enough to just about make it it a horror flick.But if your looking for action, go watch a Hollywood production.The actors are great. Hitomio Kuroki plays the role of the almost neurotic mother with great elan. Ikoku, her 6 year old, is an absolute delight to watch as she skips across the roof.The rest of the action id diverted between a divorce proceeding, a missing girl and lots of..well..water.",negative
"The plot is about a mother and her daughter who move into a gloomy new apartment with a damp problem. Soon the damp patch is getting bigger and a ghostly young girl starts appearing.....I watched this film after enjoying the first two Ring movies. Director Hideo Nakata has made another film that is genuinely creepy. Without using gore or cheap shocks he manages to crank up the tension, cleverly leaving you imagination to do a lot of the work. Whilst there are no scenes quite as terrifying as the finale of the first Ring film, this film has plenty to offer. It is also short and sweet at around 90 minutes.",positive
"Im sorry but this movie took the edge out of water and made it in to something boring. before viewing this movie i was scared of water!, now after bad acting slow screenplay and Aquaman in the end of the film, I'm not!.yeah its scary with black hair in the water glass and water dripping from the roof, children's feet running, bathtub running over... but we have seen it before! also the movie give out itself in plot, you know whats gonna happen,4 out of 10 wasting time!Cheers!",negative
"Oops... did I spoil the movie for you? Nothing happens in the whole movie. There is something about a ghost of a girl living in a water tower above the building but nothing comes of it. About as scary as being bored at work.I remember something about a mother moving into a new apartment building with a girl and there is water leaking into the building. Like a lot of pretentious movies lately there is a lot of foreboding and intrigue but nothing happens in it. It's basically a great big tease.This is just an excuse for snobby pricks to look down on mainstream (IE ""American"") movies. Not that all good movies are mainstream, but not all mainstream movies are bad either.Anyone who tells you that ""the original is better"" should set off red flags in your head... pretentious a-hole.",negative
"Watched this a couple of nights ago & it really got under my skin, it's still bothering me, especially when I go in the elevator with my daughter, who likes to hold my hand.... (my husband thought that the first time they went to look at the flat, the hand that was holding Yoshimi's was on the wrong side from her daughter- is that right?!) Won't go over the plot details again - it's just a really creepy film, with lots of little shocks, rather than the big blasts we're used to. At the end, I felt that I had to go back to the beginning and see what clues I'd missed, rather like Sixth Sense. Just not ready to watch it again yet! I'm surprised how few people have compared it to Roeg's ""Don't look now"" - lots of glimpses of faceless child in rain coat etc. Very similar feeling & use of water, water and more water. A note about shoes, after one reviewer noticed that Yoshimi always followed Japanese custom of getting her shoes on and off (very observant!) - when we lived in Japan, a neighbour had dumped her boyfriend, who then got drunk & came round screaming outside the place- he threw a large burnt-out cooking pot he'd found in the rubbish through the window, shattering it, & the police were called. And what did the cops do when they went in to investigate this apartment full of broken glass? They took their shoes off...",positive
"It's a pretty good movie, emotional and creepy, one of the best i've seen",positive
