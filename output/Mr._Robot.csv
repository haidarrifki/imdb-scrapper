"Even if you don't like it, Mr. Robot is undeniably a very unique show with lots of great ideas. It's biggest crime to this day is how much it stole from Fight Club, which is now more or less forgiven by everyone.The show is very stylish, it's unique camera angles, I love hoe they play with focus, and zooms. There are a lot of very great little montages, or parts where there is a lot of quick editing. The show's intro alone is unique enough to make people excited for the episode. So the editing is really on point inthe first 3 seasons, but in the 4th season it slows the hell down, and there is an abundance of really long takes, that are really impressive. Some locations in and of themselves are beautiful, and the CG is mostly well done, although it is not a prominent thing in the series, it's just a tool they use to make long takes easier to pull off, and it's pretty seamless, with the exception of a scene from 402 Payment Required.The whole show and the world of it is full of details. The title of every episode is very closely tied to the story and the fact that they are hackers in the show itself. There are actual websites from the world of the show, reddit pages from 2015 (the year the show is in), and so on.The descriptions for each episode on Amazon Prime are really funny too.The story and the motivations of characters always change and the show is many things at once, but it's always about the main protagonists's internal, personal emotional journey, it's the central focus of the show. He is a really likable character.Mental illness, hacking, and economics are all pretty accurately and realistically predicted in the show, that make the world all the more interesting.The overall plot is just there so that the characters always have something to do, but the characters are the important and interesting part. All the characters are either lonely, depressed, anxious, or lost, and the show explores them very deeply. All of them are different so it makes for very fascinating scenes.I don't want to say too much, but watch the first few episodes. If you like Elliot and who he is, than continue with it, and always watch it like it's his show, because it is. It is about him.Another advice: Watch Season 2 in a short period of time. Lot of people got bored because there is very little progression in a huge amount of time, and for some, it is frustrating. Still, keep watching because Season 3 and 4 are universally accepted as magnificent seasons of television.Thank you Sam Esmail! You are amazing.",positive
"This show is genuinely perfect on so many levels. The first season although very reminiscent of Fight Club is still done in such a unique way with unrivalled directing, music and portrayals of genuinely interesting and gripping characters that it sets itself apart from the crowd. Season 2 although seemingly messy and confusing on the surface unravels episode by episode and becomes a much deeper delve into the mindset of Elliot and his alter ego Mr Robot as well as an important part of the overall puzzle presented by the show. Season 3 was at the time of broadcasting my favourite season of television with consistently brilliant instalments every week, including but not limited to Kill Process, Runtime Error, Shutdown and Don't Delete Me. The bold steps taken by season 3 marked a point of no return where they had to go hard or go home with their final season and after a 2 year wait we got what I believe to be the greatest season of television in the history of the media and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Every episode of season 4 is an absolute masterpiece in all respective departments. Mac Quayle delivers another incredible expansion to the score which is one of the staples of Mr Robot and is almost single handedly responsible for its gripping atmosphere, Sam Esmail brings his A game firing on all cylinders in directing and writing giving us shocking and satisfying answers to the questions that need answering and wonderfully frustrating ambiguity to the ones that didn't and the cast are all award worthy, from Rami Malek to Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin to BD Wong, even Joey Bada$$ and Elliot Villar! they all deserve the highest possible praise for their work on this show that they have helped bring to life. Not only is Mr Robot a consistently intriguing and gripping show but it also sticks the landing making its finale its best episode which after Proxy Authentication Required, Kill Process, eXit and Conflict is no small feat. Thank you to all that helped piece together this incredible puzzle and thank YOU for reading this review. I'm going to give Mr Robot a 10/10. Goodbye, friend.",positive
Over the final 3 episodes I've had my mouth open the entire time. There's nothing that exceeds this. I don't know what to say. Watch this god damn show.10/10.,positive
"I was there when the pilot aired. I loved it since day 1. Season 4 is the best!!! Sam Esmail is a genius. Rami , Christian and all of the cast are amazing. This show is going to end with a bang. I bet the finale will be the highest rated one in tv history. And Rami is definitely going to win his Golden Globe this year too!",positive
I've loved all 4 seasons of Mr Robot but 1 and 4 are definitely the best of the bunch.Season 4 has been an epic journey so far. The only downside is waiting a week to find out what happens next. Once it's finished i'll be bingeing it all again.Rami Malek is brilliant as are the rest of the cast.10/10,positive
"Everything having to do with going against society and conspiracies I crave! Mr. Robot is incredibly filmed, written, and has such an exciting soundtrack! I absolutely love the vibes I get from all the excellent things that happen throughout. Some of the best suspense ever and profound quotes/speeches. Rami Malek has become one of my favorite actors to watch and I have enjoyed Christian Slater quite a lot. I can't wait till I can own season 4 like I own the other seasons.",positive
"This show is absolutely genius, but it never quite gained the massive acclaim it deserves because it focuses on making every single scene meaningful and visually appealing, rather than coming up with as many quotable one-liners and high-budget special effects moments as possible. In other words, it's very different from other shows. This isn't a show about a villainous main character that people mistake as an antihero. This is a show about control: what people do to gain it, what it does to the world, and how it's really nothing more than a concept that we obsess over. Mr. Robot is the story of its time, and I'm not saying that because it's an incredibly made show. It's more relevant to the country we live in than anything else on television, and perhaps more than any show in history. Think of every critically acclaimed show from the U.S., and ask yourself: were they specifically relevant to what was happening in our country at the time? This show is... and it is terrifyingly accurate. Besides being commendable for its accuracy, Mr. Robot truly rewards its viewers for paying attention to detail, much like The Wire did. Subplots are hinted in one season and left alone until they come back with a vengeance in a later season, and if you remember the hint then you're even more excited by the payoff. There are incredible symbols and motifs throughout every episode, like Elliot's beta fish ""Qwerty"", the ominous knocking at his apartment door, Price's references to WWI, Elliot's use of computer language to explain his mental state and the crises he faces, and many more. The characters have their own unique motivations for the things they do, and they never make those obvious plot-device mistakes that characters make on so many other shows to get the conflict rolling. Ralphthemoviemaker does a great job explaining why the camerawork is so amazing on his youtube video about Mr. Robot, so I won't bother repeating him, but definitely check it out for yourself. My personal favorite aspect of this show is the villains... they are outstanding. Fernando, Ray, Irving, whiterose, and the rest of the people who try to manipulate the protagonists, they all have a unique perspective of the world and a unique past that warps their moral guidelines. I hope this show gains more praise and recognition for its originality, because right now it is one of the most underrated shows of all time, and those who appreciate excellent television will agree.",positive
"Mr. Robot simply changed my life.I watched over 4175 TV episodes of 92 shows (28 still in production). But the last episode (mostly the last 3 eps) of this masterpiece just broke my heart. I was never so sentimental for characters in any movie. But this time it was like taking place of the action, feeling the anger, the shame, the frustration of Eliot. After watching so much TV, you notice they tend to have similar patterns, similar endings, but not, no. This mind****** me. The only thing that I want more is that I want more of this!Hats off for Mr. Rami Malek for converting acting into feelings to this level. And thanks to Sam Esmail for being the architect of this masterpiece!I bow to you!Thank you.",positive
"In my spoiler-free summary of this show, I'm here to express what this show has done to change everything about how I think of serial drama television. I will probably come back to do a follow-up review once the show is finally over because I'm sure this won't do Mr. Robot justice while the main story is still yet to be fully unveiled.From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unraveling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became ""Mr. Robot"" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals?Overall, I'm so happy I discovered this show and there is absolutely nothing like it. It is the most one-of-a-kind serial drama series ever made, truly, and undoubtedly the best television drama of the 2010s in my eyes. And that makes Mr. Robot pretty special to me.:)",positive
"I'm sitting here in the dark after watching the last episode with a warm feeling in my heart and tears in my eyes. Thank you for taking us on this journey. I will remember it for the rest of my life.Best regards, Simon J.",positive
"A series with a complex screenplay, multi-layered plots and ultra-brilliant acting by the whole cast, spearheaded by the ruby-like Rami Malek who personified the character's split-paranoiac personality like a glove. A special kudos to the creator and executive producer, Sam Esmail, for his deeply thought-out screenplay, meticulous execution and impressive choice of actors.Despite the shows brilliancy and sleek seasons; some filler-like, surrealistic and ""philosophical"" events weren't to my taste and I always liked it more when the flow was brutally simple, direct, featuring awesome hacking-scripts-writing & execution and Elliot talking to himself. Also, since the beginning, it became clear to me that Christian Slater could have played with more intensity, craziness and gutsy performance. He was too slow and dull compared to Rami Malek and that ruined a little and negatively impacted on their onscreen interactions IMO.You want to feel real presence tainted with hypnotic intensity, watch Stephanie Corneliussen's performance in the show and you will understand thoroughly what I mean.A rare, sort of underrated gem in the world of series and IMO, second to 'Dark' in terms of complexity.Screenplay/story: 9.9Development: 9.9Realism: 9.5Entertainment: 9.5Acting: 9.9Filming/cinematography: 9.5Special effects: 9Music/score: 9.5Depth: 9.8Logic: 9Flow: 9.5Suspense/thrill: 9.4Ending/closure: 9",positive
"Just finish watching the last episode to a brilliant series. This is hands down one of the best tv shows ever! EVER! I thought GOT was it but after they botched the last season of GOT, this is flawless from start to finish. Overall, I can't put into words how amazing the entire staff is. From directing, writing, acting, the entire tv show. Amazing! This has breaking bad and GOT beat by a landslide. Amazing ending to a stupendous series. Thank you for providing this masterpiece.",positive
How this is show is just 8.5 overall rating when only 2 or 3 epsoides in the 4 seasons are only below 8.5 and more than half epsoides are above 9 someone give me a clue,positive
It was perfect.It was great.It was great.It was engrossing.It was legendary.,positive
"Mr. Robot is sweeping up all the important awards (Best drama, best actors) and well deserved! When i started to watch this series i didn't expect much, but it has blow me away even in the first episode. A dark story about what is right and what is wrong, and the madness that that question brings. The acting is solid and so is the directing.This character, Elliot, is really drawing me in. He's so fantastically flawed, beautifully destructive, sane and insane. His outlook on the world is perhaps pessimistic, or arrogant, but there is a truth in his words - his inner dialogue that comes across as well-written poetry. By the time you're on episode four, the confusion somewhat kicks in. This is okay though, as each character is slowly becoming themselves in the show and synchronizing.I can tell how each character is going to intertwine for the most part - but Elliot is the main attraction. I believe there are people out there who are like him; snorting Morphine 30's and taking Suboxone so he doesn't withdraw - a computer genius and natural poet, and a complete sociopath who abuses his power over computers and the internet to understand the human condition and even himself.This show is well worth your time; I think even the older crowds (I'm 22) - so basically people who would be my parents, can learn something from this show. They can catch a glimpse of what we're all really like: Sociopathic internet nerds who tweet and text and share, passing information around this sterile country as if it's the very air we breath. This show captures the current zeitgeist, or overall spirit of the times - Elliot is just the extremity, of course. A job well done. I give this show a 9/10",positive
"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*I, like many people, didn't know about Mr. Robot until a year ago which is when I decided to give it a watch and ever since then I've been trying to get more people to watch this spectacular show.Mr. Robot follows Elliot Alderson, a man who is a cyber security engineer by day and a hacker by night. One day, a man named Mr. Robot recruits him into his underground hacking group to destroy E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world.It's been a while since I've finished this show and I'm still thinking about it to this day. This is one of my favourite shows of all time. From the opening scene of the first episode alone I knew I was in for something special. This is Sam Esmail's show and he's directed majority of the episodes. There's a particular style Esmail uses throughout that makes Mr. Robot stand out. The range of camera angles, the way scenes are framed and the way every scene is lit makes this show unique and beautiful to look at. I don't think there is a single weak episode in this series. This show's depiction of hacking looks incredibly realistic. The way it's edited and shot make it so intense and entertaining to watch. On top of that we have Mac Quayle's phenomenal score. Whilst I admit it sounds reminiscent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's work, it fits well with the tone of the show and I love listening to it.Season 1 is a great introduction into the eerie world of Mr. Robot and its characters. There's a lot we learn about every single character which leads to an epic season finale. It's filled with so many brilliant sequences that's edited marvellously. The dialogues are fantastic especially Elliot's narration that takes us into his mind and help us see the world through his eyes. Season 2 takes a more sombre turn and focuses primarily on developing the characters. It's my least favourite season out of the four but it introduces interesting characters and threats that build up the stakes for the upcoming seasons. Season 3 is absolutely insane. This season amps up the stakes further and gets to a point where the show becomes cinematic rather than just a TV show. Then we have Season 4, a season I believe breaks boundaries and has one of the best endings to a show ever!I also love how experimental Sam Esmail gets with this show. I always looked forward to the opening title sequence because of how different it feels each time. There's one that acts like a sitcom and one in the style of The Shining. It's very creative and prevents the show from becoming repetitive. Some episodes stand out on a filmmaking and writing perspective. There's one that looks like it's been shot in one take, one without any dialogue and one that takes place in a single location. It's these episodes in particular that elevate Mr. Robot's quality and presentation. Aside from the presentation, this show tackles many themes that are relevant. Its commentary on society, politics and mental illness above all makes Mr. Robot so thought-provoking and interesting. It handles these topics with so much care and the planning Sam Esmail and his team did to convey this through the story and characters is nothing short of astounding.One of the best aspects is the acting. Rami Malek is absolutely stellar throughout. He embodies Elliot and adds a lot of depth to the character through his expressions especially through his eyes that give a tired look to Elliot. It's a difficult character to play but Malek succeeds in every way. It's so good to see Christian Slater after a long time and he is also fantastic as Mr. Robot. Carly Chaikin and Portia Doubleday do an excellent job as Darlene and Angela. Martin Wallström as Tyrell Wellick is amazing. It amazes me how well he's able to play such a strange and crazy character. Michael Cristofer is brilliant as Phillip Price. I love his voice which makes him a commanding presence in each scene he's in. BD Wong as Whiterose is incredible. This is another role that's hard to play but Wong is captivating all the way through. Grace Gummer is also very good here and I loved the development given to her role.Despite all the praise I'm giving, this shows still has flaws. The twist at the end of Season 1 where we find out Elliot and Mr. Robot is the same person completely rips off Fight Club and at times Angela's storyline isn't as interesting as the rest of characters'.Aside from the minor issues I have, Mr. Robot will be an experience I'll never forget. The amount of thought, care and planning that went into the show amazes me. Every single performance is excellent and Sam Esmail is a very talented filmmaker who hopefully continues creating exciting films or shows like this in the future.",positive
"Mr. Robot Staring Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and Portia Doubleday is a work of art.
While telling the story of a hard working, slightly struggling cyber engineer with a hard drug addiction; it also depicts a realistic representation of how ""our democracy has been hacked."" It is also a very realistic life story with quotes like, ""I should just tell her what she wants to hear,"" and, ""We're all living in each other's paranoia."" A must watch for all.
There is no better role of Rami Malek than of Mr. Robot's Elliot Alderson.",positive
"This is the best television series ever created!
The writing is superb, the acting sublime, the camera angles crazy and incredible and the acting stunning.
The direction uses angles you thought wouldn't work, breaking all the filmmakers rules. The cuts are stunning and the sound and soundtrack a real joy. Yep that's right even the cuts are stunning!
The script has you shouting in disbelief and the acting is as real as it gets.
If you haven't seen any of the episodes you have missed the greatest television experience of your life.
Truly brilliant!",positive
"Going in with low expectation, not knowing anything about this show, the pilot turned out to offer a pleasant surprise. In short, the show is a bit unconventional, like a mix between an audio book and a TV show, but one rather well researched and executed.The acting is fairly good, the narrative style felt novel and fresh, and there's ample room for various subplots and story lines. The setting also felt real, as others have pointed out. Some interesting creative decisions were made, such as blatantly spelling out the antagonist, a company, by giving it an unmistakable name. It also makes subtle jokes and pokes fun of things probably only people in the IT industry would recognize.Whereas most shows and movies seem to throw all connection to reality straight out the window when it comes to IT related stuff, this show does not. In fact, it seems extraordinarily well researched for an entertainment piece. Being in that industry myself and having had a bit of ""fun"" as a youth, I'd have to say that overall the portrayal of IT security and hacking in this show is leaps and bounds more accurate than anything that has come before it, even if the attentive viewer would be able to spot some minute factual errors.Perchance even entertainment execs have realized they can no longer get away with silly and unbelievable things like ""magic picture enhance"", nerdy super hackers who as through divine insight guess their targets passwords in 1-2 attempts, or with peddling notions of tools that have weeks of artist design effort spent on them, for buttons that once clicked, reveal some information that would logically be impossible to get hold of through the channel used.It seems as though we finally have a show that doesn't treat its audience as idiots, and where the writers actually spent some time doing their homework. I'm just concerned that the show may be targeting too small an audience, an audience consisting of people who do not switch their brains off when they turn on the tele, and as such it may not be awarded a series contract.So far, highly recommended to tune into if you're interested in seeing something fresh and aren't allergic to narration (getting inside the mind of a somewhat odd protagonist), as there's quite lot of the latter.",positive
"If you are going to review this show only having watched a couple of episodes or season 1, then your review looks terribly silly for those who completed it.
This is by far one of the most well excecuted series in its decade, this isn't Lost where every unexplainabe thing just fades in a distance. This also isn't Twin Peaks where the bizarre moments will never be explained but encouraged.The violence gets real intensive from season 3 onwards, it gives me the same intense feeling I got when watching Breaking Bad. Most importantly is how the series ends. The last seven episodes gives you a grand finale of absolute mind boggling intensity that has you shaking at the edge of your seat. Everything unfolds. The best is once you think its the end, and they cannot possibly have 2 or 3 episodes left, it blows your mind, makes you cry and really understand the world of Elliott.How a series ends has always been important to me, thats why I loved Six feet Under and Battlestar Galactica. But Mr Robot is one of the best examples of how you end a series!! The writers of the last season of Game of Thrones should have taken notes. Truly a masterpiece! It stands unique on its own.",positive
"But after finishing season 4, my god what a masterpiece.From the first episode you could tell that the writers knew what they were doing, and knew how to make an entertaining show, with lovable and memorable characters, amazing music, and moments that make you feel. The amount of amazing episodes Sam has created is insane and it makes me wonder why this show has only an 8.5, it deserves at least an 8.8 or higher.With all that out of the way, here are my ratings for each season.Season 1.0 - 9.5
amazing start to a series, especially the first episode, a few episodes later it gets less interesting, but after seeing episode 6, 8, and 9, I knew I was in for something special.Season 2.0 - 8.0
a bit of a weak season tbh, it had some really good moments, especially near the end, but at the end of the day, it's probably the worst season of the show. But it's definitely not badSeason 3.0 - 9.0
significant upgrade from season 2, featuring some really good episodes such as, ""runtime error"", ""kill process"", ""don't delete me"" and ""shutdown-r""Season 4.0 - 10.0
words can't describe how amazing this season was. From having the greatest opener episode in the show to an incredibly sad series finale, this season will probably be the most memorable other than season 1. Especially with episodes such as ""407 Proxy Authentication Required"", ""405 method not allowed"", ""eXit"", ""Whoami"", and of course, ""hello, Elliot""bravo Sam, bravo.",positive
"One of my favorite tv series! Incredibly well written, directed acted, with a great soundtrack. Emotional and interesting throughout all seasons, full of plot twists, difficult choices and hardships.",positive
"I saw Mr. Robot and then i re-watched the whole breaking bad, and now i can say with confidence that Mr. Robot is way better than breaking bad. You don't agree? Show me a montage of breaking bad that's better than Mr. Robot. Show me an example of conflict between character in breaking bad that is better than Mr. Robot. Sow me that the cinematography and sound design in breaking bad is better than Mr. Robot. I guess Breaking bad got so much rating just because of the final 3/4 episodes of season 5. I mean that's a lot of emotion there. But who cares. Mr. Robot is better.",positive
"Did USA really just do this? They have managed to give me a combination of the best parts of Swordfish AND Fight Club and managed to make it coherent, suspenseful and a joy to watch. And Christian Slater gives yet another go at TV-Land and may have finally hit the mark!The premise: A young man working at a security firm by day, and an elite hacker vigilante by night.Sounds like it would be a bore-fest full of misplaced techno jargon, dry suspense (remember BlackHat?) and poor acting, right? Wrong! Not only was I amazed at how the story was presented, but I fell in love with the main cast with some spot on character development, GOOD use of technological aspects of hacking and a great use of voice over.Color me impressed! I am a computer geek by trade and they hit the nail on the head with almost every aspect of security and defense without making grievous errors (think The Net & the worst aspects of Swordfish). This is a must see for geeks of all ages and even hits the mark for those not so tech savvy.While the show is littered with clichés, they are all so well done and accurate that I could not find this an actual fault with the show. Try as I might, I could not find any glaring faults with the dialog, character development or even the subtle ""Big Brother"" aspects that they were going for. This is a MUST continue for USA and I will be ecstatic if it gets picked up and more episodes are made (at the time of this review it appears only 1 episode has been made). Kudos for USA for taking a risk!To sum it up; if you are a tech savvy user of the internet, smart phones or computers this is an absolute MUST see. Even for those of you not so tech savvy please give this a go!",positive
I love watching this show. It is a true entertaining show. The story is very wonderful and has many layers of action and thriller. It is just awesome show with wonderful and powerful dialogues.,positive
"This show was revolutionary. The brilliance of the writing, directing, and the acting is almost unmatched by any other show I've ever watched. It absolutely changed the way I watch other shows. Only a couple others are in the same caliber. Now that it's been a year since I finished it, I'm going to watch it again and I'm confident it'll be better the second time. Kudos to Sam Esmail for making a show that has probably some of the highest rewatch value of all time. Amazing. I cannot praise it enough. Rami as Elliot Alderson is just something I can never put into words. The deeper the show went, the better he got. I'm also forever applauding that they ended the show at four seasons. It was well rounded and genius, without being ran into the ground and ruined like so many other good dramas. Did I mention I loved this show?",positive
Mr.robot a very exciting and suspenseful series that each season progresses compared to the previous season and has unique characterizations and very good surprises,positive
"My favourite TV show of all time is the Office. Whilst that's great and all for some light hearted, switch off, bingeable entertainment, I really wanted to find something more story and character driven I could get into. And boy did I find it.This TV show is a masterpiece. The characters are so layered and interesting and this is only enhanced by the captivating performances from the talented cast. Malek gives a mysterious and at times sinister- yet somehow likeable- performance as Elliot. He ramps it up and knocks it out of the park when depicting Elliot's mental health issues, and this delivers one of the most painful, yet grounded depictions of mental health ever put on the screen. His performances alongside the brilliant Christian Slater create an incredible dynamic that carries the show forwards. The supporting cast are all great and are all given enough screen time to flesh them out, creating a truly three-dimensional set of characters.The writing is top tier, with tense story-lines and shocking, earth-shattering twists that change the entire complexion of the episodes before. At the end of episodes, I usually found myself with my jaw agape well into the credits. And it isn't afraid to put the tension on the back-burner to deliver some slower-paced, more human moments. This creates a nice, well-balanced mix with edge of the seat stuff one episode, then poignant, well-written character-defining moments the next. A great example that comes to mind is the heart-wrenching season 3, episode 8- 'Don't delete me', that succeeds the fast paced and exhilarating episodes 5,6 and 7.I'm on my second viewing of this show. Not only does it provide and entirely different yet equally entertaining viewing experience, it highlights how great the writing is. Little lines and clues snuck in right from the very start- the finale twist was in our face the entire time but it was so well hidden no one could see it. They had the whole story planned from the very beginning and it shows- this really is top tier storytelling.Every now and then, an episode will come along with a completely different format to other episodes in the season. It keeps the viewer on their toes, guessing when another 'bottle' style episode will come up- something that really enhances the viewing experience. And these are not present just for the sake of being different- they are all really well executed. From the bizarre yet genius sitcom style opening in the second season to the juggernaut of tension story-telling silent fourth season episode. And that's not even mentioning quite possibly the best episode of the entire show- An exhilarating yet devastating stage play in the middle of season 4.All of this is underscored by the incredible original score and inspired music choices. It's no surprise I like the music given my favourite artist of all time, M83 features heavily. M83's epic 'Intro' and 'Outro' perfectly fits the world-changing, high stakes drama and makes for deservingly monumental conclusions to the final two seasons respectively. I'm not even going to get started on the immense finale, otherwise I shall be typing this review long into the night.I have to save the best till last. There is not a hint of exaggeration when I say that this is the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. The thought behind every camera move, the colour palette and the attention to detail that goes into every shot, every frame is breath-taking. Negative spacing to enhance characters feelings of isolation and disconnect from one another- the framing means something. And I can say that about very few pieces of media. Even little things such as stylised title cards that change from episode to episode, the letter-boxing of the screen when the filming style changes to more conventional techniques of film-making in more dramatised, movie like episodes- it all adds up to a visually striking experience.There are not enough superlatives to use when describing this show. Its rock solid writing and gorgeous cinematography shows that TV is just as much cinema as the latest multi-million pound blockbuster release. A true masterpiece that I was always be indebted to the genius Sam Esmail and the entire cast and crew for. Goodbye, friend.",positive
S4 E7 best off the best on the tv I have ever been seen,positive
"Rami Malek gives an outstanding performance in the initial episode of ""Mr. Robot"", a promising thriller series from USA debuting this summer. I caught a special screening at Google hdqts. today and was impressed with the premise and his powerhouse acting.The Ryan Philippe/Tim Robbins movie ANTITRUST, made 15 years ago, is the precedent that came to mind for this paranoid thriller which falls neatly in the vein of THE PARALLAX VIEW and other classics about conspiracies. Creator/writer Sam Esmail has bitten off a big topic, as our hero (or antihero possibly?) goes up against E (for Evil) corporation, a vast conglomerate that encapsulates our worst fears about how the contemporary world is rigged by just a few powerful & shadowy figures against the rest of its inhabitants.For this 62-minute opener, the ground was set for future episodes, as well as delivering a satisfying one-off story for starters. Most unusual aspects of the pilot are its truly dark mood and serious tone, plus the incredible emphasis on the central character.Rami Malek as Elliot, a computer whiz working at a Manhattan cyber security company which has E as its chief client, is in every single scene of the hour, and dominates nearly all of them, with his heavy narration (including interjecting his thoughts) talking directly to the viewer who he terms an ""imaginary"" audience. There is a crucial pivot after the halfway point, when previously dangled before us in cameos Christian Slater as the mysterious ""Mr. Robot"" takes over center stage and begins to manipulate our hero and hint at a counter-conspiracy of even greater potential power than the evil powers-that-be.Beyond the computer techno-babble (which of course elicited some chuckles from the theatrical audience of Googlers on a lunch hour break), what really made this series work for me is the bug-eyed (when necessary) spooky performance of Malek as we are invited to wonder is he crazy, is he merely imagining things, or is this social misfit going to save our world? I grew up addicted to morbid TV shows (""The Outer Limits"" most obviously) like David Janssen in ""The Fugitive"" and its lighter but also effective Ben Gazzara clone ""Run for Your Life"", and Malek's anti-hero dovetails nicely with these brooding, romantic '60s figures and TV icons.Other cast members made a nice impression, though it was difficult to get one's foot in the door opposite Malek's one-man-show. Michael Gill as his boss Gideon was quite sympathetic and had a smashing (and needed) comic relief scene aboard a private plane alone with Malek when the boss ""comes out"", announcing to the bewildered introvert that he's gay, for no particular reason confiding in Elliot.Portia Doubleday is arresting as theoretically a love interest for Elliot, though as a co-worker she already has a comic relief boyfriend (also co-worker) who wants everybody to like him, even the untouchable Elliot. Guest star in first episode Gloria Reuben as Elliot's shrink and sounding board was also a good foil, as Malek insists on meddling in hers and everyone else's life according to his whim. I hope the producers don't head too far into ""The Equalizer"" territory that at times is suggested.His is a most complex character and I suspect part of the fun of watching the show will be to calibrate week to week how much the viewer identifies with him and his actions or disagrees with his peculiar tactics and issues. I can't recall such a self- divided frankly mixed-up hero since the Golden Age of film noir nearly 70 years ago.With Slater positioned to move potently in and out of the storyline at will, this otherwise top- heavy project could catch on, especially given today's audience having such a propensity for ingesting dark subject matter (""Banshee"", ""American Horror Story"", ""True Detective"" and ""Hannibal"" to name a few).",negative
Just spellbinding! I couldn't get enough! ! !Sam Esmail pulled out all the stops!I haven't missed one episode of this show since it started its first season and I must admit some of the episodes have been confusing but I always come back. Malek and Chaikin are perfect as brother and sister.This most recent episode seemed to fly by so fast - which means it was oh-so good.,positive
"This is one of the most unique show I have seen on Tv, if you are intrigued by the first episode you will probably fall in love with the rest of the show. The plot is top-notch and it is very suspenseful, it features some of the best tv characters ever, every actors nails their role. This show also features heavy amount of Hacking, I thought that was very neat and cool, but do not expect to see too much of that aspect, the focal point of this show is really the story. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for this one.",positive
This is truly one of it's kind. I just jave to write this in order to show my appreciation for this masterpeace. I was blown away from the start till the end. I've seen thousends of episodes now but after watching the last episode of mr. Robot I'm confident at saying that this is the best TV show i have ever seen and very likely ever will see.There is no way to truly show you what I'm just feeling right now.I don't now how you can't give 10/10.Just THE must watch!!,positive
"Wow this is just something I cannot describe in words about how good it is. Brilliant acting from everyone. Superb and satisfying ending and that is very rare. By that, I can confidently say that Mr. Robot is one of the greatest shows of all time. If you haven't watched this show already, don't waste your time. Go and enjoy watching it.",positive
"Mr. Robot a true series for the age of information. I think it helps to be 30 or younger to get all the subtle nuances going on here. This old man will try to do the best he can.Our protagonist is Rami Malek a perfect product of the age of information. He's a computer programmer working for a company that's supposed to protect from cyber attack their clients, the biggest of which is a company led by Bruce Altman. Said company is under attack at the moment and the leader of the attackers is cyber anarchist Christian Slater in the title role of Mr. Robot.Malek is a flawed hero like Adrian Monk and he functions best working and living alone. He's got social anxiety and the creators of Mr. Robot have used a technique first developed by Eugene O'Neill for Strange Interlude. Through Malek's own voice over narration we get the real action because the real action is going on in his own mind.Malek is socially dysfunctional, but his skills like Monk are not to be denied. It's why Slater is recruiting him for his cadre of hackers looking to free the world of debt. Free it of debt and humankind is truly free.What I find curious is that if this show had debuted 20 years ago Slater would probably the one recruited instead of doing the recruiting. Malek's Elliott Alderson is just the kind of role that Slater would have done in his salad days.Mr. Robot is well written and acted and deals with some interesting concepts about our age of information.",positive
"When I watched the first episode i was feeling kind of skeptical and i forced my self to continue watching... i am glad i did.that The performance of the characters is beyond brilliant and the plot is very intelligent and requires the viewer to be attentive every minute in order to understand. What is also enthralling about this show is it keeps on surprising you, so whenever i felt it was getting dull something mind-blowing happens and flips the plot! I remember i almost cried in quiet few scenes in season 3!I think this show should receive more attention and credit than it has and i truly hope they do not ruin it in season 4.",positive
"Right! I'm not gonna waste any second! Mr. Robot is quite literally one of the greatest pieces of entertainment ever created! A tight, sharply written, expertly acted, fantastically scored and majestically produced TV masterpiece. A breath of fresh air in an otherwise lackluster state of cinema in general over the past decade or so. This is a show that was carefully planned and executed from the very begining up until the last scene of it. A TV show that had me gripping from the first scene until the last satisfying and epic conclusion. A show that stayed with me, captivated me, haunts me and at the same time inspires me. A show that tells a unique story with multiple social commentary and lessons to be learned from it. Truly, masterpieces like this are hard to come by! I couldn't even fit the plot of this show in this single review, so instead I'll just talk about the things I love about this show, so here we go:The story: This show has one of the most complex stories I've ever seen in any medium. And at times, especially the first season, it's hard to keep up with it. There are so many things happening, but it's not like ""Rapid-fire stupidity"" from JJ Abrams where you can't even pause for a second to think about what just happened before the next stupid event comes along. It's rather a very layered, multi-dimensional, multi-perspective story full of unique characters that feel and act diferently in their own way. Simply put the plot of this show is about a hacker named Elliot who wants to destroy that status quo by tacking down the top 1% of the top 1%. The ones who play God without permission. From there the show develops into something a lot more and different with shocks and twists better than almost anything you see in any TV show. That is achieved mainly due to the fact that the story is told through Elliot's perspective, him being the narator but at the same time an unreliable one. So when things are recontextualized, you know you're in for some cool twists. I'll also mention here the incredible work put into programing by the creators of this show. Literally every single line of programing code was done for real and it looks amazing. And there are times when you can gaze upon the algorithms Elliot uses and it's clear they are authentically made, and that gaves the Show an even more authentic feeling.The Characters and acting: As I already mentioned, the characters are all unique, different and with their own unique set of qualities and flaws. And here I'll be going a little more into the acting of this show. It is quite literally a masterclass in acting. I mean at times you even froget you are watching actors playing some TV roles, but rather think you're watching someone's life develop in front of you. Not a single performance in this show is forced, nothing comes across as appaling or overacting. Everything feels natural, grounded in reality and interesting to watch. And it is refreshing to see such good performances with good stories, they actually enhance one another. I usually don't get excited about acting, because most of our film industry uses story in order to give actors great performances to win prizes at awards ceremonies. But here, even I must admit that the show is expertly played and acted, with every single actor giving a believable performance that imerses you even further into the world this show creates.The screenplay: Now, I'm no expert in screewritting but I've watched a decent amount of TV shows and movies to know when I'm watching a well written show or movie and when I'm watching utter garbage. And this is a fantastical written show with excelent dialogue and crazy and unexpected twists that leave the audience at times completely baffled by what just happened. And here is where the actual praise begins. Sam Esmail is the creator of this show and also the writer and man does he do a fantastic job with it. Literally every single aspect of this show is meticulously planed to the point where at the end you'll realise the whole show was carefully planed from the begining. I've mentioned the twists in this show, and well, Sam leaves the greatest and best twist of them all until the very end in what I can only describe as one of the most mind-blowing and satisfying finales I think I've ever watched.The score: Another thing the show exceeds at is the music. And honestly speaking Mac Quayle wasn't a guy about whom I knew a lot going into this show. In fact I never heard of him up until this show. But boy does he delives a fantastic score. The soundtrack is absolutely pitch perfectly made for this show. It enchances the atmoshpere and the tension when it needs to. And at the same time is horifingly haunting after you listen it for a while. Truly a master work here!Honestly I can't say enough great things about Mr. Robot. It's an expertly crafted, thightly written, flawlessly acted, hauntingly scored Tv masterpiece. The like of which you only find once in a lifetime. It's something cinema was invented for. No CGI nonsense or overblown big set pieces, instead everything in this show is grounded, real and very authentic, to the point that you could even think that something like this could very well happen in real life. If I were to pick gripes I might have with this show, the only thing that really bothered me was how the show resolves Tyrell Wellick's storyline. It felt somewhat cheap and glossed over, like they didn't have time to give it a proper resolution, and just thrown a random scene in there. The other thing would be just a minor gripe, and that is that the show is at times hard to follow, especially in the second half of season 1 and the entirety of season 2. But those rather slow burns are necessary in order for the third and fourth seasons to shine. Aside from that, this show is pretty much flawless in every way. I would even go as far as calling it the best written show I've watched and in my opinion the greatest written show ever! It's one of those rare gems that are ignored by many people but which influence and inspire the ones that do watch them. And I wholeheartedly recomend you watch this show! It truly is one of the best ever! 10/10",positive
"This series is a first of its kind. I have seen Art House films, yet before this never an Art House Television Series. It is a risky move and the rewards are bountiful. I started with the pilot of Mr. Robot 3 weeks ago. I binged and finished the finale just now. This is my favourite show of anything ever and I wept twice watching Season 4. This is high art. The Cinematography, Score, Editing, Acting, Direction, Humour, Characters, Plot and Themes are all immaculate. Everyone involved should be proud of what they helped create, especially my boy Sam Esmail. A visionary who can challenge the viewer and himself with:
1. An episode that appears as a oner
2. An episode with dialogue starting and ending the episode (the slices of bread that reference what is between them) and the meat of the episode being hacking action without dialogue
3. A Bottle Episode that is the best episode of the series for me, that is split into 5 acts with 5 characters and is able to have the feel of a stage play while delivering immaculate direction, acting and cinematography
4. A lost walk through the forest being one of the best episodes of television & the series
5. An ending that subverts expectations, makes sense and is incredibly satisfying given the information we get up until the twist of the final 3 episodes
6. Many episodes that have no ""gimmick"" and are among the best that television has seen to this point in time and for a long time going forward. We get shows like this but once in a lifetime
Themes of mental illness, grief, sadness & loneliness are often used and add to the authenticity the show portrays. The viewer is a character that our protagonist refers to in the first person and it works beautifully without feeling stupid or pretentious.
I was alive on this earth during the time when this show was aired and that is a beautiful fact. This will be my favourite show until my last breath

This show has changed the way we watch television. The acting is outstanding. The cinematography is phenomenal. The score is seamlessly woven into a fascinating and exhilarating story. A must see. Film and acting schools will use this show as a teaching mechanism.,positive
Rami is my new fav number 1 male actor. Just one of those once in a generation amazing actors who pours himself into a character. I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't stop. Ah fantastic weekend.,positive
Just an all rounder with this series. Sam Esmail's amazing directing completely takes the audience on a rollercoaster through all of its twists and turns. The whole series is amazingly directed with every single shot playing an important part in every episode. The directing perfectly shows Elliots state of mind in a creative and satisfying way. Every season has its own plot twists and always takes the story on a completely unexpected path. Rami Malek's acting and character are both outstanding. Elliot is such an unconventional but amazing protagonist and every episode is just beautifuly crafted. The show is honestly like no other i have watched and i couldn't recommend it enough.,positive
It's a huge shame that a series like The Walking dead has a higher rate,positive
"Raw. Perhaps a bit crude at times, but always brilliant.Mr. Robot is the type of show that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The twists and turns are huge, the characters larger than life, and somehow both the writers and the actors manage to deliver a top-quality production on par with their ambition! no small feat!A dialog on society, a warning of extremes in all their forms, the show is a representation of our fears and worries, our hopes and dreams, all merged into one big confusing mess where you end up wondering exactly where you stand in all this.A foreshadowing of our near future, or simply an anecdotal tale of our recent past/present? I guess only time will tell...",positive
"Watch till the end. You'll agree with me too.The creator of the show (genius guy, Sam Esmail) mapped out the entire story before making it. This results in so much hidden content and clues throughout the series, observable only on a re-watch.The cinematography, the score, the acting (especially Malek), the direction. Everything's just perfect. Any complaints you have about the show during its run, are overshadowed by the sheer genius of the 4th season.Episode 4x07 and the finale are seriously the greatest television episodes of all time.",positive
I've watched one season and this show is amazing! Each episode gets more crazy than the last. It's so interesting and cool I can't wait to watch more.,positive
I have never really watched a show like this before. I mean the one including hacking and stuff. I read reviews saying it was confusing and many people give up on it but they're all false. This show is too good to stop watching until you finish it. Absolute masterpiece.,positive
"The everything is incredible. By that I mean the acting, directing, editing, writing, EVERYTHING is incredible. I watched the pilot episode of Mr. Robot the night it aired because I thought from the promos that the show was created by my favorite film director, David Fincher. I found out right away it was actually created by Sam Esmail, whom I had never heard of. Even though I couldn't find Fincher's name anywhere in the first few opening credits, I gave up looking almost immediately because the first scene was so perfect. It was dark -both literally and figuratively- subtle, intense, and everything else I could ask for in a television drama; I've considered every episode since then to be a masterpiece. Every season has a unique and incredible arc, cutting certain scenes at crucial moments and finishing them later on, keeping the audience only partially informed about the bigger picture to give them a sense of the blackouts Elliot experiences. All of the main characters are complex, and the villains are some of the greatest on television (Ray was probably my favorite because he gave some of the most badass speeches of the show, like the one about prophets who heard voices). Every new twist feels like it took effort to plan and connect to previous events, unlike the twists that are just meant to throw audiences off. I've religiously followed this show since the beginning, and I'm going to miss it so much, but all works of art have to be complete at some point.",positive
"Mr. Robot is nothing more than a masterpiece, it is a piece of art. The gripping narrative, fleshed out characters and absolutely beautiful cinematography work together to show us the potential that TV has. Every show should live up to what Sam Esmail created here. This is living proof that television shows are not limited to flat lighting, bland cinematography and shallow characters and plots.Every episode tries something new, every episode expands upon the prior episode. Every episode is captivating and utterly magnificent. Whether it is an episode with no lines of dialogue or a one-shot, Mr. Robot is captivating. The brilliant use of the rule of thirds and colour is spectacular. The use of open space to have us feel one with the world. The show is so much more than a guy hacking a company, the amount of concepts that are packed into the four seasons means that the story continues to change and evolve.One of the criticisms of Mr. Robot is how Sam Esmail incorporates ideas and stories from other films and television shows. We can see the influence of 'Fight Club' and 'American Psycho'. I definitely agree that these films and many more are used prominently in Mr. Robot, I also understand why viewers may criticise this. Sam Esmail even stated that he steals from everything. But Mr. Robot is so much more than a carbon copy of another property, it is a collage of so many brilliant films. While 'Fight Club' did not expand too much with the idea of an entire character being inside the head of another character, one of Mr. Robots main plot line is Elliot's and Mr. Robots duality. Their two different views and ideas. Sam Esmail took ideas from other films and shows and expanded on them, he took them and mixed them together to make this masterpiece.Without sounding too tacky, Mr. Robot has changed my life. The philosophy explored in the show is one of the most interesting concepts ever seen in television. After my first watch through I had a completely different outlook on our world. Elliot's many monologues about our society is so much more than words on a screenplay, they're concepts up to the viewers interpenetration. Is Mr. Robot a show about a hacker taking down a conglomerate? Is it about mental illness? Or is it about how our society is built around each others paranoia, how our society has created a fake reality that we inhabit in the form of social media?Give Mr. Robot a watch and you decide, what does this show mean to you?",positive
"Incredibly twisted, intelligent and so much fun!!
I've binged watched tons of series the past few years... this is without a doubt my favorite. I loved it start to finish. Malek is just an incredible actor. I remember watching him in a mini series of sorts a few years ago, may have been his first starring role... I was blown away because at the time he was a nobody...but he was fantastic in it and in everything He's done since. Either he's gotten very lucky with great roles and shows or he's made them great by himself... I think the later is more accurate.A must watch!!! Can't believe I overlooked it for as long as I did.",positive
"Mr. Robot is one of the most underrated, under-seen, and misunderstood TV series out there. It is a near perfect cinematic masterpiece.I was amazed that this was on the USA network. This show plays like a foreign film--edgy, dark, risqué, and cerebral, with stark, daring, and aesthetically pleasing cinematography. The writing is top notch, not dumbed down for general audiences.Every detail you see needs to be taken in and catalogued in your brain so you can refer to it at a later time. Because the smallest of details will come into play in a later episode or season.Sam Esmail is a writing and directing genius, and ALSO a genius for enlisting Mac Quayle, the MUSICAL genius who created one of the top scores in television history. Esmail also chose the perfect songs throughout all seasons that truly fit the mood and emotion of the scene or character. Some of the songs and score are now part of my music collection.Some people seem to have given up on the show around the beginning of Season 2, which is noticeably slower paced and darker than usual. But believe me, it picks up steam less than half way through and doesn't stop. Season 3 is stunning (there is a ""one take""/real time episode that is groundbreaking and outstanding). Season 4 is brilliant! Too many brilliant aspects to list. This series also has one of the best endings ever: clever, mind blowing, and bittersweet. 100% satisfying.So forget all the reviews right now. This one, you will have to see for yourself whether you'll like it or not...it will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions: it will amaze, it will frustrate, it will upset, it will inspire, and you will be sucked deeper and deeper into this dark, melancholic, nihilistic world...it doesn't need to be read about right now, it needs to be experienced!",positive
Best show so far . I haven't watched any tv show like this . This is the most underrated tv show. Watch it now.,positive
"The greatest tv show I have ever seen, i just finished the show and I am literally sitting here with my mouth wide open. What an experience. Definitely worth watching once in a lifetime, the acting, the thrills, camera angles, the soundtracks (just wow) and the narration are simply the Best. Thank you Rami Malek and Sam esmail and Goodbye friend",positive
"From beginning to end, Mr. Robot delivers. Can't wait to watch the series again",positive
"Easily top 10 in series out there. On the level of Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Dark for example. Nothing is perfect so it's a 9. Amazing acting, great story. Different story. Complex in a simplistic way if that makes sense ? Left me with a lot of messages and understanding ones self better.Captivating. Interesting. Intense. Deep. Intriguing. Honest. A whirlwind. I thoroughly enjoyed it. You won't regret a single episode. Slater hit this out the ballpark. Hats off.",positive
"It's not often a series opens with such strong performance, it brazenly captivates the audience with not only smart premise but also an identifiable observation of society. Rami Malek confidently steps into the leading role with all the awkwardness and anxiety of a vigilante hacker. Mr. Robot takes a different route of technology-based crime drama, it treats the subject with enough credible realism and without being detached from audience like over-the-top hacker with sunglasses gimmick.Rami Malek as Elliot delivers a hefty amount of monologues, he literally communicates with the audience as though he's talking to an imaginary friend. This approach could end up stale, yet the brilliantly fresh material and admirable performance make for a highly intriguing watch. Elliot is tech savvy, though sociably clumsy. It's a different take on leading character, which is why it's compelling to see him dissect all the trivial matters with unapologetic precision.He solves problem by stepping on a gray area between privacy breach and vigilante assistance. At some point he encounters an attack to a large company's server. There he finds a ploy to sabotage very important parties and the subsequent far-reaching effects. Due to his indifference nature and chosen action, Elliot begins his involvement in the web of conspiracy.The production is nice without being overly futuristic. Clips of social media and the view of large metropolis are handled with poise, transitioning from a cool shot of the urban scenery to cynical presentation of pop culture. It doesn't attempt to glamorize hacking like typical blockbuster mishaps, the kind where the hacker shouts at the screen with countdown timer. The show knows its theme and it presents it with both accessibility and sophistication.With an outstandingly interesting pilot, it's a pleasure connecting with Mr. Robot.",positive
I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING WILL TOP BREAKING BAD BUT DAMN ESMAIL YOU PROVE ME WRONG THIS IS ART...MR WHITE,positive
"I am just amazed at Sam Esmail's brilliance, the cinematography is the best I have ever seen which hones the story and makes it the best ever. The subtle meaning in the dialogues , can not even go on to explaining that.",positive
"From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unravelling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became ""Mr Robot"" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals? Truly one of the best shows on Television.Season 1 - 9.0Season 2 - 9.4Season 3 - 9.5Season 4 - 9.8.",positive
"The pilot episode of this series shows great promise. At the risk of failing to appeal to the modern television viewer who has become accustomed to shows lacking true substance, it will most certainly captivate a core audience of viewers who feel alienated by the typical programming of the modern day. The narrative touches on topics like social and digital revolution through the thoughts of the protagonist as he narrates the episode. The status quo of modern social behavior, consumerism, and corporate greed prevailing by virtue of the complacency amongst the proletariat is a core issue that both the show and protagonist address with great disdain. It ironically begs the question that if our complacency with the quality of consumer items––such as substandard television programming––is so entrenched in our society, when we are finally greeted with an oasis of the kind of talented artistic expression that this show offers devoid of being dumbed-down or hollowed out in effort to appeal to a wider audience, will we be able to transcend our usual tastes, or will the level of real, thought-provoking narratives lead a disinterest among the typical armchair audience and eventually the show's demise? Much like other successful programs such as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""House"", that received a large following despite some very technical aspects of the dialogue that tend go over-the-head of the majority of their viewers, Mr. Robot followed suit and still holds true to it's core audience by fact-checking its more technical content and preserving its validity. Most films or programs with a hacker or computer science theme tend to overplay the ""coolness"" of what is shown when it comes something as dry as computer code by representing the digital world as it it were a fantasy, in lieu of the more accurate yet bland, plain-text unix coding on a computer screen. I was surprised and also relieved to see the actual computer science portions of the episode be accurate representations of a real-life scenario down the very character. As with other successful programs with story lines derived from complex subject matter (like medicine or theoretical physics), the amount of technical dialogue is not so much that it will bore the majority of the audience who will not understand it, but just enough that it will captivate and perhaps even educate them slightly as they are offered a glimpse into a fascinating world whose power and influence they wouldn't otherwise comprehend. My hope is that USA––the network on which the show will air––will recognize that they have struck gold, and not run scared if viewership starts off slow. Most shows of this caliber do not take off will a large audience, but rather begin to amass a strong cult following and later become a huge hit. We saw this kind of skepticism among network executives with Breaking Bad. Much like the idea of a school teacher cooking meth to pay his medical bills, a computer nerd with a social disorder and possible schizophrenia working for a network security firm by day and playing social hacktivist by night is not something that immediately screams ""blockbuster"". It's my hope that the timing of this show will prove to be its greatest strength in light of recent events in the hacking and cybersecurity world involving Anonymous, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Ross Ulbricht, and Aaron Swartz. Viewers are educated now more than ever when it comes to hacking and the impact that individuals can make on society through their ""hacktivist"" work.The protagonist of Mr. Robot is similar in many ways to these individuals, and the plausibility of his disposition is validated by their individual plights. Where they have fallen short of their ultimate goals and failed to elude capture, the audience will root for their new favorite anti-hero since Walter White to incite a social revolution through his hacktivist work. Whether he succeeds or is met with the same demise is up to the writers who have crafted this brilliant first episode.",positive
"Hello_friend, I hope to convince you to watch Mr Robot.It is one of the most underrated TV series in my opinion. I remember that when the first season aired every one watched it because hackers were in, but then the majority stopped, their bad. Mr robot is not just about hacking, it's something definitely smarter.The plot is super intelligent and you have to pay attention to details because everything happens for a reason, and that reason will be explained sooner or later. Events always have logical consequences, but this does not mean that they're predictable, indeed it is plenty of surprising turns of events.Mr robot is not dramatic, thriller, psychological or action, but it's all of them mixed together. Personally I loved the psychological development of Elliot, and when THAT thing was revealed in season 4 I was so moved. But other than that, I enjoyed also the revolutionary ""social"" events of Mr Robot, which are something that we can easily imagine to happen nowadays.An other thing that makes the difference in this series is the cast. Malek is really impressive, as well as everybody else. And when I say everybody, I mean literally everybody, even Janice's and Irving's actors. But the biggest revelation is Esmail, whose screenplay has reached the perfection over the years.I hope that I have convinced you, goodbye_friend.",positive
"This is the best show I have watched since breaking bad, and it might even be better! It is certainly darker.The first season and finale are excellent. Everything in between was a depressing mess. I will remember this show for its final episodeI do like the focus on depression and trauma, I would rate this a 9/10 which is the highest rating I give. This show is REALLY GOOD, but not all the time, It has some pacing issues. Season 4 is one of the greatest seasons in tv history. I would've preferred if the middle part of the show focused more on dissociative identity disorder and mental illness. The end concept was great. I love the ""real Elliot"" plot line. The final episodes made the show worthwhile. This series is worth rewatching simply because of its finale. The ending of this show is a masterpiece.",positive
"Another winning Dexter style formula of hero, the wife and I enjoyed this program a great deal and think this is a winner.Modern, gritty and self medicatinga good cast and well acted, the lead character is instantly likable and i know enough IT guys to see bits of some of them in there.watching him act in peoples lives and his struggle with his own mind is quite a refreshing scene in this day and age, i grew up with mechano and buckets of lego, this generation has a world of knowledge and with the right know how can get under the skin of anyone they meet, scary and cool in a happy bundlekeep making this one!!",positive
"This show is simply brilliant.
I've never connected with a show more than I have with Mr. Robot - not even close. There's an Elliot Alderson inside us all.
It hurts to say goodbye to this exceptional series, but all good things must come to an end. I'm just really happy they didn't milk it.
For me, it ended beautifully.
Thank you Mr. Esmail (and everyone involved) for a truly brilliant work of art!",positive
"I do not watch much TV nowadays. Less than 10 hours per week. TV series nowadays are mired by half baked ideas picked up by Netflix/ Amazon/ etc etc. They are brought to air and when people actually like them it seems that the companies go oh sh%t they like it we need more. So the writers come up with half ars%d ideas. Mr. Robot is different, there are no, ""well that is just stupid doesn't make sense "" moments. Everything is believable, even down to most of the hacking. Roller coaster ride that is worth your time, and I don't say that often.",positive
Probably one of the best series that I've watched.,positive
"One of the greatest shows ever created. One of the most poignant stories about the modern era and one of the most important stories about mental illness. Mr. Robot is, while an exhilarating and intense series, one of the most beautiful studies of the human mind you will ever witness.Every bit of the show from the very first episode through the very last moment is carefully crafted. Mind-melting as it may be, there is ample pay-off throughout and ultimately, follow-through.The devil is in the details with this one. Sam Esmai's creation has always been relatively cultish, but I believe over time, this show will garner even more viewership.Simply put, I will miss Mr. Robot, but I am glad to have been one of the many 'voyeurs who think they aren't a part of this, despite being here for all of it'.10/10",positive
"Mr Robot burst onto the scene in 2015 winning numerous awards, including an Emmy for Rami Malek as an outstanding lead in a series and a Golden Globe for best Television Series. It's second season let a lot of people down with a convoluted plot. It rebounded nicely in season 3 and the final 4th season.Sam Esmail created such a unique masterpiece with Mr Robot. It has beautiful dialogue, cinematography, and a score to match. Each character is important and every single second of run time is important to the plot. It ended in 2019 and I'm currently rewatching it. This rewatch is making me miss it even more.All that being said, it's not for everybody. Some people are fans of simple, thoughtless entertainment. Mr Robot would not fall into this category. It has numerous reveals that throw viewers off, which is fun for me, but not for others.This is one of my all time favorite shows and I hope if you haven't watched it that you'll give it a chance. Enjoy!",positive
A fantastic show from start to finish. Rami Malik is without question one of the finest actors of his generation. And Sam Esmail is an undeniably brilliant writer/producer. One of the greatest shows ever.,positive
"Intellectual and fast paced Mr Robot is the show we've all been waiting for, not a vampire or teenager in sight and about time too. In the mega choice of shows available these days it's hit or miss with a lot in the grey middle ground - Mr Robot is a clear hit. From the start it has you buying in to Elliot's story and this is thanks to Rami Malek's brilliant portrayal of him, a lost soul who is dissolutioned at the world and those who run it. He uses various methods to cope, including keeping most people at arms length, using illegal substances and oh yes, the internal dialogue that runs in his head, keeping him in check as to what is real and what is imagined. But what happens when those lines blur? Elliot's life begins to give him what he's thought he always wanted; a way to take down the greedy corporate bigwigs that wrung their use out of his father and then fired him when he got sick, that understand just what he's capable of and that see him for who he is and embrace him totally.",positive
"No words can actually express my feelings.. It is beyond perfection.. S1,S4 was the best one for me..",positive
"A very well written and executed TV Show. Mr. Robot is very dark and mysterious show with mindblowing execution. Rami Malek and Christian Slater have blown the show by their acting.
Season 1 is great, season 2 is bit slow and dramatic but will worth watching for upcoming seasons. Season 3 is good with medium paced execution.
And Season 4 is - WOW!! You will just fall in love with whole story and mysteries.Cinematography and screenplay are one of the best I have ever seen.",negative
Unlike almost all tv series that drag on for more than 2 seasons this managed to make SENSE about its ending (compared to the clues of the first seasons) and also be relatively comfy as well. It can't get a perfect score of course because it dragged on a bit more than it should have in a few cases and it felt repetitive at times but it was an excellent show and one of the best in the history of television from start but also to finish.,positive
"Mr. Robot started of to me as i described ""just a junkie hacker"", when i gave the opportunity to myself to go beyond that and kept watching the seasons, i noticed it's so much more than that and every episode is meaningful and has no fillers. Even the time that seems dragging out was the open the possibility for a recuperation from the twists and building up to the next twist in the same episode. I've been mindblown through the entire series and i fell in love with the cast. I must thank everyone involved in this masterpiece. It is indeed, a true mastermind! I wish the mastermind stayed after all this, he really grown on me and i was sad to see him go. I will re-watch this tv show over and over through the years, because even though i know whats happening, i can't get enough of how good it is.",positive
"Well after season 1,2 and 3 I tho this show couldn't play anymore tricks with my brain but after season 4 episode 11 I am once again paralyzed and unable to fall asleep.",positive
Ramy Malik is very very good actor and he present one of the best characters in the history of TV. The Director Sam Esmail did a great job he is different and he has his especial way which is very good to me.,positive
"I only got to watch this show now in 2021. But boy am I happy I did. I've always shared many of the points of view as Elliot did. The stuff about social media being full of fake people and a breeding ground for attention seekers and narcissists. I thought I was alone in feeling this way.Anyway overall despite personal feelings about it. The acting by Rami Malek is absolutely brilliant. I don't know if he won an Oscar yet but he definitely deserves one. The story is absolutely brilliant as well. I think they canceled it because of all the stuff it was exposing. The sickness of modern western culture, the unchecked corporate corruption, and the demented people that we have voted to lead us.",positive
"This review contains spoilers.Mr. Robot is a television series by Sam Esmail that premiered on USA Network in 2015. The series is about a vigilante hacker.Mr. Robot is a series that heavily focuses on Elliot Alderson, played by Rami Malek. Elliot Alderson is the focus across the four seasons of Mr. Robot. Ellio Alderson embarks on a massive journey across the four seasons and the audience comes to a deep understanding of Elliot Alderson. This is not common with many television series. Sam Esmail put a lot of effort into Elliot Alderson and it shows. In addition Rami Malek plays the character incredibly well. He highlights the struggles that Elliot Alderson encounters.The side characters, especially Darlene, also embark on a journey across the four seasons. These characters are involved in the hack and are engrossing to watch. However, the story does not focus too heavily on them. They are interesting characters but they have story arcs that can end abruptly. The characters in general are well written and highlight aspects that Sam Esmail wants to highlight with modern society.Mr. Robot is a well shot and beautiful series that serves as an example of creative focus. The episodes frequently feature artistic shots that highlight each of the character's struggles. Isolation and loneliness are central themes in Mr. Robot and the art style reflects these themes.I highly recommend ""Mr. Robot"".Grade: A.",positive
"Though Christian Slater's previous tech-geared TV drama flopped without notice, this new effort has just enough grit to keep people interested. The main character, not Christian Slater, could be one reason for a positive shift. Elliot, played by Rami Malik, pulls off the beady eyed grayhat fairly well, and riffs of ""Fight Club"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Hackers"" all coexist to compose a decent melody of scenes. For me, it appealed to the cyberpunk bookworm and anime watcher of old who spent decades in a barely fed genre.Yes, the technical aspect of hacking is dumbed down quite a bit, but you won't see giant pacmans eating pixels on the screen or progress bars labeled ""VIRUS"" either. Social engineering is given equal weight as well, which is a welcome area of focus. Hopefully the writing team and creative directors develop plots and characters in a non-linear fashion, and don't begin to rinse and repeat the show into yet another formula driven cash-cow.I look forward to the future of this series, with fingers crossed.",positive
"Wow, I started watching first episode and was skeptical. Those type of shows about hackers and conspiracy are not my favorite. But I loved the first episode, it is well done, acting is amazing however it seems to be going too fast. It seems they have too many ideas and only show us a little bit. The first episode had just over an hour, yet so much happened in it that it could easily be split into 2-3 episodes. But at least it is not boring. It also seems real. And they use command tool for hacking, not one of those super spy CIA graphical interface that you just have to press ""HACK"" and you are hacker .. oh how I hate those. I am not saying this is the way hacking works, but it does seem closer to the real thing more than dumb Hollywood movies. I watch many TV shows and this one really got my attention. Highly recommended.",positive
"I started out thinking this show was a bit too ""dry"" for my liking: I generally like shows that have at least a bit of dark humour to them so I initially gave this a 6/10 review. For the first two seasons I recognized this show was well written but I didn't realize just how well written.I've got 5 more episodes to go in the 4th and final season, and I had to come and review this show again and up the rating to 9/10 because I think it may be the best written, best acted, best filmed series in the history of ""television"".",positive
"The is one of the best series I've seen. Great acting, superb script, definitely worth watching!",positive
I will always be grateful for this series and for the time I spent with it. Thank you to everyone who worked on this series and for making this series a part of my life.,positive
"Where do I start? Perhaps by stating what I feel is important; forget the fact that Mr. Robot airs on USA network, as it is HBO/Showtime quality material from start to finish. The writing is fantastic, the acting is generally good throughout, and the music is uniquely fitting for the world these characters live in. Mr. Robot is a show of many twists, some more obvious than others, but more importantly it bucks the trend of storytelling found in most modern cable TV shows. What I found interesting about this show is that the producers/writers are quite willing to push the proverbial envelope for network television. There is plenty of sex, swearing(although it is ""silenced"" out, it's still quite obvious what the characters are saying), violence and backstabbing to keep even the most grizzled Game of Thrones vet interested. More importantly than that though, is the content that the show brings. For once we have an intelligent show about not just hacker's lives, but hacking in general. Most of the hacks found in this show are grounded in at least some reality, which is a far cry from what we are used to seeing in movies and media over the last several decades. Notice Elliot booting up a Kali Linux distro on his computer to ""own"" one of his targets? That's about as real as it gets in the hacking world, and I truly appreciate the realism the show brings. As a Computer Science student who is currently focusing on Cyber Security, I really appreciate the level of detail Mr. Robot brings in regard to cyber security/attacks. Even the computer jargon used by the characters is nearly always accurate, which is even more surprising for a TV show. If you don't care about all the techie stuff, there is plenty of twists, intrigue, and backstabbing here for everyone. While the show certainly focuses heavily on computers/hacking, you certainly don't need a background to understand whats going on. It sure does make it more interesting if you do, though ;)Overall this is a show that deserves all the credit it is getting, and more. I waited until season 2 came out before I started watching season 1, mostly because I thought USA wasn't capable of delivering a show of this caliber. This is my humble opinion obviously but if you are like me, don't let the network turn you off. This show has a lot to offer for most, if not all, adult audiences, and should be given at least the first 3 episodes before judgment. I just cannot applaud the creators/producers enough for creating a smart, accurate, show about the modern technology world. If you haven't watched it yet, well, you have 2 seasons to catch up on. And for that, i'm very jealous.",positive
"The reviews you see are not wrong.This is one of the best if not the best series you'll watch and to top it off with a deserved brilliant ending. It's an example of how you make television to be honest.Acting brilliant..the cast are brilliant
Script brilliant
Concept brilliant
Filming brilliantIt's just a brilliant show.If you've not, start watching it, stands alongside breaking bad as one of the best pieces of television, films etc ever made",positive
"Mr robot is the proof that tv shows can be as good as movie and not something just entertaining to be Bing watched.
Rami malek did such a great job.
From the beginning to the end everything is well writen and planed.
They didn't start season just to keep the hype. Rami knew all along how the show will end.
This show deserve so mutch attention.
Hope we will remenber more of mr robot than Game of thrones",positive
"Truly incredible, all 4 seasons were just mind blowing. For years Breaking Bad had been the bar that no show could peak. But I think I may have found it, albeit a few years late. There's no real way to surmise just how brilliant this show is. Having just watched the last episode of season 4 I just kind of sat there in awe. From the first episode to the last all the actors were flawless, the writing of a level so high you wonder how they'll possibly be able to top it, the world they crafted and environment so believable and seamless, it was all just so perfect. This for me is the new standard that ever new show will be measured against.",positive
Was waiting to finish watching it to officially give it the score it deserves! Absolutely mind blowing. Never seen anything with more twists and turns in it. Absolutely fantastic gripping thriller great job with everyone involved.,positive
I'd say it's one of the best series I've ever watched. It's story is amazing and the twists will blow your mind. It's totally a must if you're a psychological drama lover.,positive
"/refers to Series 1/I am usually cautious in watching software- and/or freak-out-related movies as they tend to deal with difficult matters not bespeaking me. But Mr. Robot, recommended to me by some like-minded friends, turned out a different one, when the topics mentioned are just a background and ""excuse"" for wider concepts and global issues really happened/happening, and one can ponder on and over multiple follow-ups of globalization and Internet, e.g. technical vulnerability, social differentiation and stratification, personal loneliness and emptiness, use of various mood-improving substances, etc. And all this in a ""digestible"" package, with interesting turns, distinct approaches, skillful choice of character actors, and intertwining multi-layer events and characters. All actors except Christian Slater were rather unknown to me, but there is a good chemistry between them, no one dominates too much, and a Swede called Martin Wallström made his first and successful international appearance. And, of course, Rami Malek is ""just it!"" for this role, and hopefully he will get more leading roles in the future.The very ending of the Series is intriguing, and despite the fact that some last episodes saw some decline in pace and clarity (for me as non- follower of Occupy Wall Street! type of events), I am looking forward to the next season.PS Season 2 was slower and more sophisticated, but still a good show.",positive
"Mr. Robot is the most gripping Tv show ever made. From the first WORDS. My interest was peaked. Each season has new interesting changes to the formua. The characters are excellently written the twists the show makes are so well executed.
If you want a show that puts well written and grounded scenario's with raw emotion into the mix this show is for you. This is a show that cannot merely be put in the background it's a complete adventure I urge you to watch. Sammy Boy (Sam Esmail) is perfection.",positive
"When I started watching this series it immediately connected with me. Many years ago I've written some notes to someday write about vengeance on the top 1% of the top 1%. It's a really cool idea for a series.
There has gone much attention to the hackings and technical details which is really appreciated by a technical person like me.
One day I hope to write a book entertainingly containing the life lessons I've learned by experience to pass along to my children and their children. Something they can look back to and learn from, start from and evolve from.
I hope the creator of this series also had such premise and saw this as his life work. From reading other reviews it seems to have impacted and touched many lives.
Mr. Robot contains many details which resonate with my own ideas and thoughts. I like how it goes into the topics of social awkwardness, self identity and the meaning of happiness. It's the combination of great storytelling, philosophy and filmography put together into a grandiose work of art.
I can write a lot more about the many details I appreciate, but you have to experience this for yourself. I can't help but feel excited and amazed that someone was able to create this.",positive
"Mr. Robot is brilliant storytelling.The only thing is you need to be patient. This show is not for those who have short attention spans because the attention to detail is meticulous. From the gorgeous cinematic quality-like camera work, to the philosophical writing, Mr. Robot is top quality work.I really loved watching the show and there are some episodes that really stand out amongst the pack as some of the best episodes in recent history. I highly suggest everyone watch this show because it's just so good.",positive
"This is great achievement in entertainment, it's like it invents its own language. I feel like re-watching the whole thing soon, and it will be a whole new experience. Amazing work Sam, Rami, Christian, and the rest of the cast and crew. Love Portia Doubleday.",positive
"This show had its ups and downs, but the ending cemented itself in TV history as one of the most clever and fulfilling shows ever. I cant give the whole show a 10 just because, but the last season deserves an 11. Sam Esmail is a mastermind. The music was king phenominal. Wow. Great show. Worth time for sure.",positive
"The series has a very interesting premise. By far it has the closest technical reality when it comes to hacking .(i am talking about the bullshit they show in movies probably using hackertyper). Very nice portrayal of solving computer problems in real world. The lead character has done a really good job convincing the viewer of his mental state. The writing was decent.The cameo from Christian Slater was very good. When he talked about software running the world, virtual money and moving away from gold standard which are absolutely true. Overall the subject is really tough to deal with and the director/writer did a wonderful job in giving the audience a clear picture. One hour pilot was spectacular and I hope it will progress into a more engaging TV show. I am confident of USA network since they have been giving excellent TV.",positive
Hands down the best show I've ever seen. I don't really wanna say anything else. The pilot will hook you and you won't be able to let go.,positive
I am sure I saw too many great show in my life but never seen something like this...it will always remain in my heart,positive
"I'll be as direct as I can - if you think all we had was King ""Breaking Bad"", ""The Sopranos"" and/or 75% of ""Game of Thrones""...get ready to put out a new placemat at the big kids' table of TV shows and watch this now. Be warned, it is quite dark and at times macabre so be mentally prepared beforehand to be a little disheveled for the duration.This show manages to transcend reality while being one of the most realistic shows to come down the pike - maybe not in style or character but in the execution of many of the major plot points especially from a technical perspective. This isn't 1995 and it's not ""Hackers"" or ""The Net"" - every hack shown is 100% possible and paints the command-line interface as the most dangerous weapon anyone can wield.The plot and tone while derivative of ""Fight Club"" (mostly the first season) feels more like a respectful tribute than a rip-off (even ""Where Is My Mind?"" as a piano interlude playing in the background of a pivotal scene, being very forthcoming in its respect to the film).The characters are just constantly under duress and you're left wondering how they are going to possibly get out of a situation (or not...) and there are more twists and turns than the brush-stokes of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"".The casting is spot on and the acting is tense and dark, perfectly complementing the overall tone of the show. We are continually introduced to new characters that set the bar higher than the ones before - especially the antagonists...we truly are kept guessing on fates and allegiances, and sometimes even on what is or isn't real...no one is truly safe.Cinematography is some of the most unique you'll find in any show or movie. The unbalanced framing and color palette never manages to paint any of the characters in a deserved, relaxed or innocent light - rather it is almost like the camera serves to intimidate instead of emphasizing, showing that no matter what the characters think of themselves or what situation they're in, the surrounding world is and always will be bigger than they are.While some of the episodes are quite slow especially in the 2nd season (there are a couple that are about 80 minutes long) However - the 4th season is possibly the most well-done final season of any show made. It is so tense and satisfying, to put it into perspective - I rewatched the first 3 seasons at the end of last year (since I hadn't seen the final season yet I wanted to refresh) and that took me about 2 weeks and change but I BLEW through the final 13 episodes in 2 days. It was that good.I know I didn't even really get into any details but you really don't need to know anything before getting into this...just watch it. Even my 70 year old mom who loves soap operas and has zero interest in computers (or anything remotely technical) says it's one of the best shows she's ever watched. It really deserves a larger audience.",positive
"History -cI just want to watch over and over in a recursive loop with no depth check.Looked up the M83-outro song and can't stop listening and feel a sense of loss. If a show does that to you, it did something right.",positive
"Honestly, the show had a pretty good season one. When the first season ended, I pretty much lost it XD cause it was so obvious that the whole concept was heavily based on a film (I won't say which so it won't be a spoiler, but if you've seen both season one and this film you know what I'm talking about). I wasn't sure how will the series go on, but I'm glad to say that it gets better with each season.The editing is great, and like most aspects of the series it gets better with each season. Same thing about the acting. (Especially Elliot, Vera and Whiterose ) The soundtrack is solid as well, and even though the pacing is a little bit off in some episodes, I do think that the show maintains interest throughout.I love the experimentation with different formats and episode structures, and the fact the every little detail, since the very first season, turns out to be a clue for the ending :) It ties everything together in a great way.
I also really like the creative way in which the series breaks the 4th wall, most of the times it's quite clever.btw, my absolute favorite episode is 407. It's a 10/10 episode, and probably one of the greatest episodes of...well, anything, ever. An absolute masterpiece.To summerize it all - it's quite a great of show. It is mostly well written, well edited, well acted, and it just keeps getting better from season to season. I totally recommend checking it out.",positive
"The writing in season 4, along with the overall plot of the show, development of a complex world and characters, and unparalleled cinematography, have propelled Mr Robot comfortably in a spot as one of the greatest shows in the history of television. The conclusion of the show - undoubtably - will only push it even higher.",positive
"It isn't just a show about a cybersecurity engineer by day and vigalante hacker at night. I've been with this masterpiece story since the beginning, and now that the last episode has aired I will carry it with me forever. The writer and director, all the actors (who are all deserving of Oscars), cinematography, music composer, the production crew, have come together to create something so memorable, and the viewers are just as important to the creation, as well. If this show doesn't grab you, draw you in, make you wonder what you are watching, then it just isn't for you, which is ok. But if it is, I'd warn against total binge watching; instead ponder and come to some conclusions before moving on. I've watched all episodes 3 times and will watch again, there is always more to learn. The ending is only deserving of praise. Thank you, Sam Esmail.",positive
"This show is the greatest show that ever existed on human history
Watched and you'll never regret seeing it""",positive
"After watching Breaking Bad I never thought I'd have a chance to watch a TV saga at the same level. I think I watched the first episode of Mr Robot at least 5 times, immediately after that I stop watching it because I found the atmosphere very dark and depressing until I stopped my excuses and watched 6 consecutive episodes and believe me that once you dive into Elliot Alderson's mind, you will not be able to continue your life without checking on him. Episode after episode (it's with me at least)
The vast difference in the imagination of the program maker, Sam esmail
It led to giving each season its special characteristic events, unprecedented picture frames, creative directing ideas, especially the last season that enjoys richness and artistic creativity that I have not seen before in any season of any series, an episode representing the stage, a pure action episode, an episode of imagination .
But if we talk about strengths, it is necessary to mention the dialogue first. Man, any dialogue is considered a quote as well as preparation and preparation for the end of the series (the idea is inspired by the fight Club movie, in my opinion). As for relationships, this is another world that I almost Sure that there is no relationship in order to fill Emptiness, all relationships are important in the development of events, even relationships in which you are hopeless. Also, each character has ups and downs and events that make you change your feelings towards it, as the character you hate in this episode finds yourself sympathetic to it in the next episode.
We talk about acting a little. Simply this work presented enormous acting talents and energies, but by virtue of that rami malek is the hero, it is necessary to talk about him, and I do not hesitate to say that he presented a character from the best I have seen in the world of television, a troubled personality, suffering from schizophrenia and able to turn his thoughts in any Moment.
In the end, I will talk about the ending that I see legendary enough to connect all the events of the four seasons (I consider it the best ending to the series)
I am not here to compare but as a story and events attachment, I have never been attached to characters like this (especially Elliot and Darlene) and to a story like this.
So it was wonderful to live this experience and I am afraid that I will suffer in a vacuum afterwards because only good experiences leave you this feeling after the end.
Goodbye my favorite show.
Good bye my friend.",positive
"Wow.Just wow.I watched this based on recommendations and it is actually the first seasonal movie I will be seeing and it didn't disappoint me!I am a Software Developer and trust me, all the hacking/coding scenes of this wonderful masterpiece are just on point.You are not in for those regular HTML hacking, this is real life!",positive
"It was June 2015. I was only 7 months old in in a new city. Was still trying to figure out out, the vibe and the people. Needless to say, I was missing Delhi badly.
Some of my friends know, I'm a TV show and movie buff, so I used to take respite in their company.
Mr. Robot probably launched a couple of weeks after my B'day and when I played it on a lonely weekend, I was shell shocked.
This series was launched without much fanfare and the scrawny protagonist(Rami Malek) looked like he was acting since ages. The script and direction (both by Sam Esmail, somebody I'd not known before) were masterful and the camera angles were unique. I was hooked onto it in the first couple of episodes.
I was so much in awe of it that I had a chat with my friend DD and told him that mark my words; this guy, Rami Malek, is going to get an Oscar pretty soon. I said the same to my newfound friend in Pune, Sandeep Washivale. Sandy who wasn't a TV buff until then, started watching this series on my persistence and we used to discuss about it in office.
Mr Robot is not about hacking computers, in its essence its about human behavior, it dissects deep into every characters' psyche and it goes where anyone else would become uncomfortable with.
Not one person in this series is not flawed, yet you'll not hate a single person. Not even the villain. But you'll also find, the villain is also dynamic and is based on your perception.
Rami Malek lived as Elliot Alderson. He didn't act. It's one of the best acting pieces you'll ever see. At par with Matthew McConaughey in True Detective or Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad.
What differentiates is, that it's written better than Breaking Bad. It's hard to believe it, but it is.
Rami Malek, as one of my only true predictions in life, went to make a movie on queen(Bohemian Rhapsody) in 2017 and came back with an Oscar to complete the finale of the series. He already had won an Emmy for Mr Robot in 2016. I got happy when I saw that a no-one at the start of the series in 2015 had turned producer for the same in 2019.
Sam Esmail had a tough job. All three seasons of Mr Robot were fantastic. It was an uphill task to tie everything and make sense out of it. Probably the break that Rami Malek took, gave some buffer time to Sam Esmail to outdo himself.
The 4th and final season of Mr Robot, is a masterpiece in itself. Each and every single episode.
I waited for 24 hours before writing this so that I don't go overboard but my feelings have not changed.
Mr. Robot will remain with me forever.
While, I had to use some other ways back in 2015, all you need right now is an Amazon Prime subscription to binge watch this weekend.
You'll love it, if you like short pace storytelling and a complex storyline.",positive
"After finishing the series, I feel like I could write a book on how Mr Robot deals with certain themes and subjects. The basic premise of the series, the plan of a hack that could change the power relations in the current economy, is what drew me in, but the rich subtext of this work of art is what is compelling me to write a review.
I am calling it a work of art because it required a rarely seen amount of liberty and creativity in how everything was presented. From the more conventional, plot-driven seasons 1 and 3 to the ""looser"" seasons 2 and 4, that only use a semblance of a plot as a device to explore their themes. The plotlines are resolved in the exact way that the creator envisioned them, the messages are presented when and how he wanted them to. One may agree with his vision fully at parts, but disagree at others. Patience is key.
This is why I cannot say that the series is ""perfect"", as I would personally have preferred some small changes. For example, crucial information is often deliberately obstructed, which creates multiple layers of mystery at best, confusion and irritation at worst. I do not think the series was at its best when it was trying to twist the plot for the sake of it, or even when it engaged in rampant social commentary. I appreciated both, but I always thought it was at its best either when the characters conversed under certain power dynamics, or when their actions and consequences were presented in relation to their context. Maybe even when the plot fizzled out in favor of some new exploration.
About that, I have to recognize the amazing effort put into exploring mental illness. It is the only concrete aspect of the series that I will mention in the review. It was part of the ""spiritual"", ""looser"" part of it, and I thought the presentation made it justice and really made the viewer more aware and empathetic.
As regards the technical aspects, the TV is a medium that combines moving picture with sound, and Mr Robot deserves a 10/10 on that department. Excellent music and a great imagery that ventures from fast-paced action with quick cuts, to masterful long takes, to a slow, awe-inspiring dream-like haze. I love all of these styles for their different merits. I loved the grandiose openings and every scene was a pleasure. Beautiful combinations.
To end the review, I do not think that Mr Robot is the bingeable series that takes over your free time, nor a plain dramatic story with its high and low points. As a whole, it can't fully be described without its subtext, and I don't think tying it to a particular aspect of the subtext or the plot can encompass it. It is rather a stoic, creative, mature work of art, that presents a number of ideas by using and eventually transcending the medium television, best appreciated on an episode-to-episode basis, in my opinion. Because as a viewer, you can do what one does with every work of art: appreciate it and be glad and amazed it exists.",positive
"You know when you read or view a work of art that leaves you staring away in amazement. I am too limited in my vocabulary to render proper praise, this work was Nearly Perfect.",positive
"Mr. Robot is, to put it simply, a brilliant series. You don't have to be a total tech-savvy in order to enjoy it and appreciate the marvellous storylines. The genius writing of the show is impressive (and its pretty much accurate portrayal of hacking) as well as the execution; the narration is intriguing, always leaving me wanting more at the end of an episode, and it never slows down. The interesting framing gives something unique to it, too.The characters are well-rounded, three-dimensional; especially Elliot, the main character, is very well-written with the accurate portrayal of his mental illnesses and disorders. I believe I read somewhere that they had an actual psychiatrist read the scripts to get it all right.The acting is superb and believable. Rami Malek, who plays Elliot, makes every monologue captivating with the way he speaks, which is the reason why the generous amount of voice-overs never feel ""heavy"" to me. That and the use of voice-overs works wonderfully in this show to get inside Elliot's mind.Currently anticipating season 4 (which will also be the final season). Hopefully, it'll be as rewarding as the previous seasons. Kudos to the cast and crew!",positive
"I'm a huge fan of anything related to computers, and after exhausting cheesy 90's movies about hacking (cough cough Hackers), I found this unique show recommended to me by a friend. Between the claims that Sam Esmail did justice to the actual act of hacking and the superb cast, I was sold on watching and got my popcorn ready as I began to binge. But nothing, absolutely NOTHING, could have prepared me for this unimaginable rollercoaster of a story.Not only did Esmail deliver on depicting a true-to-form and realistic big-screen adaptation of hacking (about time), the narrative behind this show proves to be among the few that can dethrone some of the best shows out there (Westworld, Downton Abbey, Mindhunter and Vikings to name a few). Rami Malek and Christian Slater deliver some truly award-winning performances to compliment Esmail's jaw-dropping narrative, the way forward paved with twists and turns that would make any M. Night Shyamalan movie look like a trailer - and not to mention Mac Quayle's incredible soundtrack providing the perfect backdrop to every single shot. The narrative proves to be very interesting, not simply focusing on the generic ""save the world"" premesis that most forms of media tend to chart, but rather placing that plot in the background while the show explores the deeply wound personality of Elliot and the reasoning behind his actions (and the fallout of consequences brought on by those actions).Mr. Robot definitely satisfies our need for a good computer-focused television show, but adds to it by creating a driving force behind the interpersonal drama that overlays the rapid keyboard typing and intense python script executions. This has been the only show I've ever watched to instantly ascend to No. 1 on my all time favorite shows list, and trust me - when you watch it, it'll be the same for you.",positive
"The feel you get when you sit on a rollercoaster ride... start and move slowly before a deep fall and raise... then slowdown here and there... that's exactly the feel you get while watching Mr. Robot. You will feel its going slow in places with long dialogues but that's something needed because there is a deep fall coming (twist and turns) in the storyline.Season 4 is epic. You could get the taste of it in Season 3 itself. First 2 seasons are to set the stage for last 2, but you won't be bored. There are few flaws here and there but doesn't matter like you may see characters responding to both Elliot and Mr. Robot looking at them separately when they are shown on screen physically standing in different locations (considering both are same personality supposed to be standing in same position for those characters). Like I said, it doesn't matter.Technically, cyber attack/hack concepts were handled very nicely at the story level (dialogues, tools names, usage of technical terms etc were good, though debatable on security loop holes they were explaining/exploiting that are not exactly that easy in reality, but better than any of the webseries/movies I have seen so far)Remember Disney's Inside Out...? for some reason, the last episode made me think about that for a while. Every one of us has multiple characters inbuilt which one we bring to front depends on the situation we are in. Elliot is no different.Overall, this is one the best webseries to watch.",positive
"A modern classic written and directed by Sam Esmail. Cyber-security, mental health and anarchy. These topics have been abstracted from reality in film-making history. Not in Mr. Robot!Throughout 4 brilliant and equally important seasons we follow the life of Elliot Alderson and you are his friend. Actually an everyday character, but an everyday character who's invisible in the eyes of many people. Rami Malek fantastically portrayed him and I can't think of anybody else at his place.That's true for any other character he meets - from Tyrell to Mr. Robot. Their goals reflect their fight against the world and its struggles. Brilliant actors, it's rare to find such a near-perfect casting. Don't let me spoil it for you, if you're looking forward to understand everyone's actions and their goals, then take this show into consideration.The post-production crew elevated everything to Esmail's vision and just by watching you can feel the great chemistry and team-work between them. Cinematography, editing and especially the background score are experimental throughout the series, fitting to the episodes.The journey of learning more about the characters and the truth, finding theories and scratching off theories just doesn't stop. This probably captivated me the most - twists and turns. Very well paced suspense, which only got topped by Death Note in my opinion. Sometimes you felt the truth already, but you didn't want it to be true. And sometimes these turns feel out of nowhere, but when you look back, they're the missing pieces of the puzzles.As for most art works a director's vision and mind affects his projects' depth. Sam Esmail isn't narrow-minded and he doesn't manipulate the questions to make his answers true. He gave us the answers he found.Mr. Robot is for you, if you're looking for the balance between suspenseful visual storytelling and reality. A big thank you to everyone who worked in Mr. Robot, which definitely has a special place in my heart.",positive
"An excellent, very well-crafted show that displays creativity at its best. It's dark, depressing and disturbing at times, but somehow still satisfying to watch because of its compelling plot full of twists and turns that never fail to deliver. Its innovative visual storytelling really makes it an unique experience for the viewer. It borrows from other sources, but still manages to be very authentic. Every season goes into new emotional and visual lenghts until we get to the ending that gives an entire story a whole new meaning and, surprisingly, makes perfect sense.",positive
"Loved it. Some episodes will simply haunt me forever, and for those who have seen it, i am pretty sure you know which ones i mean. I cant stop comparing this to Breaking Bad as both are great tv shows that provided amazing characters and a very cohesive story line. Mr Robot is as well written and has as brilliant characters and is as consistent as Breaking Bad although Mr Robot is faster and more gripping. The Acting was amazing and the characters were beyond. The only thing i didnt like was that feeling that i didnt get a resolution after the final episode, something that Breaking Bad did perfectly with its finale. Although in the light of past experiences, we learned - the hard way - that the ending of almost all great shows are almost always disappointing, and with this in mind, i would say this one passed, with flying colours. I will miss this show, and my compensation is that some of its characters will live in my head. Forever.",positive
"One of the best series I saw, notice, it is not for everyone, but if you can bear it, you are going to love it, beautiful series and great ending, 10 out of 10.",positive
"The best there is in televisionI watch a lot of TV, and usually it's hard to pick my ""one favorite show"". But after watching Mr Robot that choice is no longer difficult.
It excels in pretty much everything it does; casting, acting, writing, direction, themes, atmosphere, music, framing, etc.And as a computer scientist it is so incredibly refreshing that, for ONCE, hacking and computers aren't treated as something mystical and magic. The tools, terms, and techniques used in the show are legit. Code snippets that are shown actually do what they are supposed to do, and aren't ripped from HTML-tutorials online.I've heard complaints that people usually give up on the show in season 2, since it tries a lot of different things and use a lot of subtle symbolism that seemingly make no sense to the average viewer; but I urge you to stick with it. The fact that the creator had the ending planned out from the start really shows in the final season. s04e07 is, without a doubt, the best hour of television that you will watch.I can not recommend this show enough. And if you're even a little bit interested in IT, it should be required viewing.11/10.",positive
"This show is some of the most clever writing I have seen since the early days of Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, or Dexter. This show has plenty of twists and turns that will leave you shocked and sometimes confused and lost until that part of the story develops more. At that point you have that ""Ah hah!"" moment when things fall into place. I have been a Cyber Security Professional for more than a decade, and am very PROUD that almost all of the tools and methods used in this show are not only mostly accurate, but for the most part very realistic. This is truly the most accurate depiction of what ""hacking"" actually looks. If you're a fan of suspense and haven't seen this show you're missing out. I definitely have to give this a 8/10 - as no show is perfect, but this is definitely close. The reason this didn't get a 9/10 is because the show depicts a hacker group that is a blatant rip off of a real Hacker group that was heavily prominent in the Mid to Late 2000's.",positive
"This show is just good. I can't put it into words to describe the excellence that comes from the carefully crafted and well thought story lines, acting and directing. Sam Esmail is truly a living legend as this show is a masterpiece. It's funny, Dark, scary, realistic, yet it includes elements of the paranormal, romance and even Sci-fi. This is all brought together by an excellent cast, in which is very likable, even including the shows antagonist (In season one). Combine all of this with dozens of fantastic plot twists that carefully explain themselves, while opening up new questions for speculation in future episodes. Mr Robot is quite possibly one of the greatest shows of all time, as it combines everything subtlety into almost each episode. It truly deserves a 10/10 rating. Please, go out and watch this!",positive
"An audiovisual masterpiece in every way. This is more than entertainment, and that's something that will not be for everyone. Thought-provoking, moving, majestic, unique and out of this world are the words I can find to describe the show.Always consistent, never dropping it's quality, given the fact it always had a beginning, middle and ending planned from the start.Remember, a Mr. Robot episode is more than just entertainment; it makes you feel, makes you think, it truly is edge-of-your-seat worthy. It has marvelous technical aspects, I would even say it's technical aspects are the best the show has to offer but I would be doing a disservice to the writing, and the acting.Four seasons of Mr. Robot. Four seasons of standing in awe in front of your TV watching this audiovisual masterpice.Definetely one of the greatest shows ever but without a doubt not as mainstream as Breaking Bad, let's say. Like Twin Peaks before, Mr. Robot is doomed to become just a simple cult classic. A shame, really, because this show tells a very human story in a very (intrincate yet understandable) and unique way.",positive
"Where to begin. This show is undoubtedly the most high quality production I've ever seen. The plot is genius, the characters are fascinating, the acting is superb, the directing is astonishing. Sam Esmail is my favourite director because of everything he did with this show (but Comet is also amazing). The score is absolutely the best I've ever heard; Mac Quayle did a breathtaking job and I do hope Volume 8 gets released one day. It's incredibly hard to fault the show, particularly because it knew everything from day one. Esmail clearly had every little detail planned out from the very beginning and it shows. It made the payoffs so sweet, and all in all the story is just brilliant. So convoluted and yet in the end, so simple. Twists and turns everywhere, and respectful enough of its audience to subtly insert the clues and information in the right places. This was my first rewatch of the whole show, and I think it's safe to say that this more than any show is completely transformed once you know how it ends. The rewatch value definitely added a new dimension to it, although I can't help but feel like I enjoyed watching it more the first time around when I had no idea what to expect.It's not a perfect show. I am not a huge fan of the narration and the show's insistence on the audience being a character in itself, and I'm also not really a fan of Elliot for pretty obvious reasons. He's excellently written don't get me wrong, but he's just not exactly likeable lmao. Besides those things, I honestly can't really think of any other downsides. I'd probably just be nitpicking. It's a show with a big heart, and a very satisfying conclusion. It's the best show I've ever seen by quite some distance (with the exception of Orphan Black) and I'm honestly not quite sure how they pulled it off the way they did.",positive
One of the best tech thrillers of recent times. Amazing story line with perfect casting.,positive
"This show was amazing. The plot was very intelligent and it blew my mind sooo many times. The acting was incredible, the soundtrack was perfect, the cinematography was brilliant, the attention to detail... There are so many details in this show that I think I will only be able to uncover even half of them upon a rewatch. One of the best tv shows I have ever seen. Highly recommend it !",positive
"Deep and meaningfull, this show is my new favourite i have watched many shows and it is the one of the five fav tv shows i have ever watched . Direction is too good i loved the writing i loved the acting . I just loved this show.",positive
"Why? Because there is no one single moment where the show falls and get flat.
Because it has golden episodes ,at least five perfect great moments that tv gave us , wich ones? Runtime Error , 405 method not allowed, 407 Proxy Authentication Required, 409 Conflict, Exit , oh and also a perfect ending.
Because there is a meticulous and beautiful work of sam esmail that proves his love for the cinema. Everything is technical.
What else can we ask for?",positive
"Great twists, acting, story, directing, characters, pretty much perfect",positive
"The show is really good, it was little boring in the beginning (like all the shows are) but I enjoy it. My favorite thing is that we discover with eliot who he actually is and it feels awsome and deep, anyway I really recommend this series to everyone.",positive
How am I going to find another series where I get so attached to the characters? I purposely tried not to quickly finish Season 4..I knew I would miss watching.This Series is up there with Six Feet Under( the 1ST Series I ever watched) and Battlestar Galactica.I am slightly confused with the ending....but I'll work through it.Absoutely an AMAZING experience! Loved ALL the characters.Rami is a joy to watch.CRAZY GOOD!,positive
"Mr. Robot is something unique. I am not aware of any series that takes the realism of its subject matter so seriously. Anyone versed in technology or IT will quickly see this. Every hack is real. The tech they use are not props, they are the real thing. In many cases the actors themselves were taught the real keystrokes required to run these tools.The casting could not have been better. Malek is superb as Eliot. Wallstrom is a very convincing fanatic. Slater plays off Malek perfectly. Doubleday's evolution through out the series is a standout. I could really go on. Everyone was fantastic.Esmail really hits his stride by the 4th season, and creates two of the better episodes of TV, ever. 405 being the standout.Everyone should experience this show at least once. Even if you have no interest in hackers or psychological thrillers, any fan of film composition will see the quality of the cinematography and writing.",positive
Well it's the greatest show mankind has ever witnessed even better than breaking bad in my opinion . Rami malek has given oscar worthy performance . Plot twists and reveals never disappointes . I Can't stop praising this tv series enough . Unique concept with best ending ever . Please go watch this series.,positive
"I won't spoil it for anyone, but a must watch series. Very well thought and created show. A lot of people can relate to this show. In a world where we create elements to fit in and to protect ourselves... 10/10",positive
"The pilot started in a really intriguing vague way .. it went so mysterious ,, i didn't even see the trailer .. The story began simply about this socially awkward hacker being paranoid about someone following him ... some flashbacks then the other main characters starts to appear one by one.The plot is not that fresh but the execution ""through my 10 years of TV shows obsession"" was genius ,, so much like the movies where there's a delusional guys or you think is he really !! the beginning of it kinda reminded me of ""fight club"" monologue style .. through this secretive scenario it kinda made me want to watch more ... want to know more ... is this guy really a hacker or is he a new Age Stalker !!! .. but the rhythm went down exactly when Elliot meets with Mr.Robot in the train before it get back to be more exciting and full of questions.And i loved the idea of him easily hacking everybody and analyzing them based on their passwords and Facebook pages is he a bad guy!! or is he a guy trying to save everyone from Evil Corps :D .. Gosh so many questions have been thrown at us in the first episode .. and they left us with a massive confusion in the last scene :PThe Drama looks really good .,, not much on the crime part.. maybe it got on the Cyper crimes thingy more!! the other thing that set me off a bit is there are so much technical talk ... which even for me as an Engineer sounded nerdy and not easy to understand but still kept so damn hooked.As for the Cast is fine , Rami Malek the Pharaoh from the museum ;) and his face was priceless acting delusional, i love Christian Slater and all the others were fine.Overall,, the pilot went just okay .. Fast events .. few things needed a bit more info .. i don't know!! maybe the Tech guys would love this kinda shows even more.. it might be too early to judge but i really hope this gets even better and more clear so it would be up there with other USA Network hits like ""white collar"", ""Suits "" or ""Psych"" and not to be just another summer show waiting to get cancelled.___________________ Update _________________________USA has given a second season to cyber drama ""Mr. Robot."" .. Early renewal = a really good sign ;)_____________________________________________________",positive
"This is a show worthwhile watching. A series about hacking, but not the usual whiz kids. That helps a lot. The first period was already an eye opener and the characters are as real as they can get. The protagonist has personality problems, which makes him the more acceptable. He knows his way computer systems and is able to dig up all kind of information on others. And how is does is very believable.I won't go into details in order not to spoil it for other viewers, but I can really recommend it and suggest you lean back and pay very good attention. It is certainly not your run of the mill sitcom and requires your attention from the beginning till the end.",positive
"After finishing this programme, I'm left re-living every part of my existence, my angers, my sorrows, my pain and realising this entire journey is what makes a person.Struggling with life and enduring hard times and how we deal with them are envisaged from a different angle and get the mind thinking.Remember that time you day dreamed and then wondered how you got to your destination? What were you replaying over in your head and wondering how differently things could've worked out?This show is art, don't let its pace deter you from the finale, this programme is breathtaking!",positive
"Creative take on what is otherwise a formula plot of an evil corporation (or something similar) wanting to control humanity. Some may be taken back by what they were conveying in these snippets: Koch Industries (a play on the conservative donors, the Koch brothers); casting of leaders from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, US, Turkey, Pope as not being in the best interest of most of humanity (or life on Earth).Outline: We have the Whiterose designed investment group Deus; the wealthiest, most powerful men. Their front is E Corp.
Goal: Consolidate, control, manipulate global events for profit.
Method: Everything is online, control it and you ... manipulate the public.
Current hook: China to IBM, we look forward to stealing all your intellectual property.Can't figure out how in some scenes Mr. Robot, by himself, can be spoken to & touched by others?
Final three episodes felt oddly just added on especially the nuclear power plant mishmash.",positive
"I reviewed the pilot episode and gave it a high ranking. I looked forward to the next episode ... it was so-so. Waited for the next ... oh dear, what a dysfunctional mess. The main character, who 'seemed' so interesting in the pilot, has degenerated into little more than a shallow child and the other characters in the show are little more than window dressing and as undeveloped as the main character. A show with great potential sadly wasted on a clichéd hum-drum who cares anyway story. I am left wondering why, when there are so many interesting and stimulating places to which scriptwriters can take an audience, they choose depressing life-scenarios and self-obsessed pseudo-intellectual ghetto types as their subject of choice. Pointless and boring. Rated at 2 and I'm being kind.",negative
This is my Favorite serie so far and i'll reccomend it to everyone.,positive
Very enjoyable and relatable . Has many twists and exciting . Must watch.,positive
"...No, it's better that Dexter. Why? NOBODY CRIES!It's true. A bloody miracle. I watched the whole of the pilot episode and not one person burst into tears.Now, this is an American TV program, so this obviously won't continue. I expect the floodgates to open maybe next week or by episode three. The Yanks can't help it. It's not proper TV unless some sappy idiot is crying.I suppose it's a ploy to get the women interested in Sci-Fi. It won't work of course, but TV executives have the intelligence of a biscuit so they'll keep trying to push Sci-Fi onto women even though they absolutely hate it, don't understand it and just don't want it in the same room as they are in!It's just like Dexter - Sociopathic outcast narrates us through the plot and keeps mementos of his 'conquests.'If the quality of the pilot extends to the rest of the series it's going to be bloody fantastic. My hopes are low though... As much as I loved the pilot, I've learned not to get my hopes up.If you liked 12 Monkeys then you'll hate this. Mr Robot makes sense!",positive
"From the pilot to the last episode. The acting, writing cinematography and direction was seamless from beginning to end. The portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder was spot on, and the story was wonderfully told. Kudos.",positive
"Mr Robot is criminally underrated and deserves more hype as a top 3-5 show ever in my opinion. Very few shows have the narrative journey and build up of Mr Robot's 4 seasons. The writing is ELITE in many ways- my favorite things about the show are:
1. The Misdirection. You'll be extremely surprised at how well plot twists are pulled multiple times in every season.
And 2. The Backfilling. The show will purposely omit some of the chronological storyline and go back to fill in with details that prove relevant. This way of storytelling can be so interesting when there's a lot of story to tell, and it's pulled off perfectly in Mr Robot.
The main cast (Malek, Slater, Chaikin, Doubleday) is unbelievably good. The secondary characters (Wallstrom, Wong, Cristofer, Gummer) are unbelievably good, and the guest stars (Joey Badass, Craig Robinson, Villar, etc) bring unique roles.
Now that this show is on Amazon Prime Video, hopefully it will get the recognition it deserves! It's rare to find a show with a story this well-written and well-acted, it's a must watch.",positive
"I just finished watching the four seasons in one week. I can't say much about it, I'm actually speechless. It is incredibly beautiful, creative, intense, intelligent, stylish, well acted and filmed... my words are spoiling it but my need to write something about this masterpiece persists. A big thank you to all the people that participated in this amazing story, of course I could indulge in a few critics but what the hell, it's brilliant. Thank You.",positive
"I recovered this show just in these days and ... WOW, really fantastic and amazing, a perfect script, engaging, without any burr or forcing, with characters ALL DAMNY COOL, really superlative actors (Rami Malek is great and with him too Slater , Wong and Bobby Cannavale), the series ending is magnificent, it seems, initially, that it is the classic grip end for the pads and instead, right at the end, with the REAL ending, everything is in the right place, everything fits perfectly.I congratulate Sam Esmail on this great series.To those failed and pathetic buffoons who write Walking Dead I have only one thing to say ""look how you write and make a great series and take note"".",positive
I just started and right now in 3rd season. Oh man. Just clicking on next episode. Cant wait for 5 sec on prime to wait.,positive
"I do not have enough superlatives for this series.I applaud the makers of this series, it is absolutely outstanding.I work in IT but am not a coder and some might be put off by the complexities of coding, although actual coders will easily pick holes in that area, but I would ask them to give this a break as most wouldn't know the detail in that area and I wont go into any further detail on that as it simply isnt relevant and would detract from the pure brilliance of this series.For those out there that have binged on Sopranos, breaking bad, GOT, Stranger things, AO, Boardwalk empire, some might say, the wire and dexter and let's not forget band of brothers etc. And my all time best box set, Gomorrah (which some either havent heard of or cant be bothered with the subtitles, boy oh boy that is your loss)Mr Robot deserves a place in my top 5 ALL TIME things that I have watched.And I still have the 2and half of series 3 and all of s4 ti watch which if the reviews are right, then it will be the best series I will have ever seen and most likely ever will, they simply do not get any better than this.This will blow your mind beyond anything you will ever see. So clever but be warned you have to concentrate because even then its impossible to figure out what is ACTUALLY happening and what is real and what is NOT.It also gets better and better so stick with it, if you dont you will undoubtedly miss out on one of the best tv series EVER made for our so fortunate eyes, ears and brains. Also maybe our souls",positive
Most brilliant show ever seen...In every single episode you will learn something new ......,positive
This show is way ahead of it's time. Time and again it has produced episodes TV has never seen. Sam Esmail's writing and direction is on another level. Show gets better with time and ends with a bang. Don't miss this masterpiece!,positive
"Mr. Robot is by no means a flawless series, it has its flaws, its issues, its downsides. But all in all, it is one of the most enjoyable and mindfûcking series of all time.I do understand how the ratings don't come near the scene's grands such as Breaking Bad or GoT, but Mr. Robot is something you should /never/ miss.No matter how it gets cliché at rare times, no matter how many times it gets confusing or meaningless, or slow, you NEED to push through it, most of the people who are hating on the show probably blame it on Season 2 or 3. But there is no way in hell that you make it to Season 4's finale and not end up hyping up the series. It's just so good that my words can't describe.The cinematography is so beautiful, I thought I paid too much for the BluRays but they're super worth it.",positive
"I've never felt compelled to write a review for anything on IMDb before, until I watched Mr. Robot. From the very first scene to the final one, Mr. Robot contains nothing but quality. The story is possibly one of the best in Television, coming together so seemlessly that I am shocked the show aired over the course of 4 years. Every piece of the story is considered and utilized and it comes together in such a satisfying way by the end with brilliant characters that are all so well written and interesting to follow.The acting is phenomenal, especially from Rami Malek, who goes through so many different emotions throughout the show and makes Elliot feel like a completely real person. Whether the scene is loud and intense or quiet and subtle, Rami knocks it out of the park with each scene. Christian Slater is also excellent and keeps me glued to the screen everytime he shows up.The presentation of the show is also a shining star. Each scene is so visually interesting along with the compelling content that there isn't a single moment of this over 30 hour show that's boring. It's also super creative, with standout episodes like ""eps3.4_runtime-error.r00"" which is made to look like one continuous take, or ""405 Method Not Allowed"" which has only two lines of dialogue and is told entirely through visual storytelling. There's also ""eps2.4_m4ster-s1ave.aes"" which has an entire sitcom length sequence at the beginning, and ""407 Proxy Authentication Required"" which is presented as a 5 act stage play analyzing Elliot's character. The show also contains an amazing score by Mac Quayle, which showers nearly every scene with brilliant tone setting music that helps make the show even stronger.Overall, Mr. Robot is a show where every single piece comes together so effortlessly that it truly feels like a cinematic experience. The show isn't perfect, with a few tiny issues here and there, but the vast majority of the show is filled with nothing but excellent characters and performances, phenomenal storytelling, and great presentation that makes the show a must watch. This is probably my favorite show of all time, and more people need to watch this show.10/10",positive
This is the best series ever made thousand times better than GOT and breaking bad . A masterpiece made for intellectual,positive
Best tv show if you didn't watch until now you're making a big mistake.,positive
I don't know why you are reading this review. Stop it. Go watch the show. You're welcome.,positive
"Charmingly claustrophobic and delightfully disjointed, ""Mr. Robot"" does a fantastic job when it comes to placing the viewer in the mindset of the show's characters. With their enemies closing in on every side and not knowing just who they can and cannot trust, it is only fair that we viewers feel that closed-in sensation that they are, without a doubt, experiencing. Following along with Elliot's social and mental disorders gives us the same dizzying disconnect that he must be feeling. All of this, masterfully written. It is almost as if the nervous energy and confusion are the paints with which the masterpiece is created on the dystopian canvas the show creates.Along with the brilliant writing and acting comes the treat of the show handling computer ""hacking"" in a way that is the most realistic depiction offered by today's television and movies. The hacks are not illustrated with three-dimensional directory structures that explode with gibberish once the hack is complete. The hacks are actually done within a Linux shell environment (Kali Linux, specifically... one of the best Linux-based cyber security distributions out there). They are illustrated in a way that is tech savvy enough to satisfy my inner nerd, while being general enough to not confuse the technically uninitiated.If you are looking for a thrilling show that is full of twists, turns, and jaw dropping reveals, ""Mr. Robot"" is definitely for you. I warn you, however, to pay close attention to EVERYTHING. If you miss a detail, chances are you missed a lot, which can lead to the bad kind of confusion. But, if you pay attention, even the most confusing aspects of the show are explained in full in a manner most satisfying.",positive
"You watch this show and go through what Elliot is going but in reality the whole show is focused on you. You are going through it, it focuses on what you will think. Excellent show.",positive
"Absolutely mindblowing.
Elliot was to me as interesting a character and as well acted as Breaking Bad's Walther White.
Great story full of twists and turns that gets wrapped up in an actually satisfying and very emotional ending.
Rami Malek was a joy to watch and especially in season 4 his performance was haunting.
Add to this the absolutely stunning cinematography (every title card was gorgeous)The first season alone has a very ""Fight Club"" vibe around it, especially with it's anti-capitalist themes. If this is your sort of thing you will LOVE Mr. Robot.",negative
"I hung in there hoping Season 1 would become a truly gripping and insightful story about technology and it's big brother presence in our daily lives and how dangerous that is for both the public at large and the corporate structures that are so reliant on it. No dice. I watched the entire Season 1 episodes back-to-back and was flabbergasted at the shallowness of this series. First off, Malek's wooden performance is a dead giveaway early on to one of the weak surprise reveals. Second, the sub plots of the ghetto drug culture and homosexuality were blatantly obvious fillers to widen the demographic net, probably foisted on the writers by the network execs. None of it added to the story. The insidious perversity in this story really lies with the executive management goals of E Corp and that was barely examined as an encompassing and destructive aspect of current society. While we heard some very articulate - great writing here! - complaints with the inner monologues of the lead, not much time was devoted to the real impact of monopolies and their greed, data breaches, and the human disconnect that has electronic chatter replacing social engagement. Lastly, I'm not a techie so I can't comment on the technical accuracy, but I'm doubtful that the crash could have happened as shown here. If it's this easy to get into high security buildings, break through firewalls, enlist the Chinese, etc., etc., then we are ALL - not just corporations - in big trouble and this was not addressed at all. That's where the real story & suspense would be. My 2 stars are for the ""attempt"" at something meaningful, even though it failed. I don't understand all the high ratings - is it spoofing?",negative
"I started following this series the very first day the pilot episode was available, and I have to say it's a flat-out masterpiece all the way through, from the first episode to the season 4 finale. It's unlike anything I've ever seen, and I have never been as emotionally invested in a TV series as I was with Mr. Robot. If you want to know what the story is, you have to see it for yourself, and I won't be describing that here. Also, in my opinion there was not a single bad episode in the entire run, which is highly rare in any series. But now that I've seen all of it, I am finally ready to say that Mr. Robot is my favorite series of all time, behind all my previous favorites such as Breaking Bad, Lost, Twin Peaks, The X Files, etc. And I will be watching it again for sure.The creator Sam Esmail did something truly special here, and I'm sure in the future he'll be making lots more of amazing films or TV series, or some clunkers, who knows. But I have a feeling this will forever be his magnus opus, one he'll never top. The only thing I kind of feel bad about is that not many people ever followed the series, and it especially didn't have a big audience on TV by any means, but hopefully more people will discover it through streaming and DVD/Blu-ray and other means.10/10, a masterpiece, and I would recommend this to EVERYONE, no matter what genre you're into. Thank you to all involved with the making of Mr. Robot, it's been an amazing ride for the past four years!",positive
"Sam Esmail and Rami Malek's gift to the world ... Mr. robot
A story of a guy in his twenties burnt with flames of anger ... so alone and so sad, projecting all that onto a world that never fails to prove to him why he should be alone and sad and worthless.
He fights ... fights so hard that he furthers his isolation from everyone
He dug too deep into his own self and lost track of the battle ... is it for the world? Or maybe against the world!
He was defeated ... again and again and again
And for the last battle ... there is again and only defeat in sight
But now he began to understand ... to have a chance in winning ... or at least to make some meaning within your exit from this world ... you have to hug your sister ... love your father ... say goodbye to your mother ... trust your friend ... and believe the one and only truth ... there is actually no meaning in solitude; what is worth living, fighting, and dying for, lays only within the touch of your fellow being.The message is loud and clear, we read it in books and see it on screens, but rarely can touch us as this mesmerizing, unforgettable, and life changing art does.The final season of this masterpiece is a series of masterpieces ... each episode is a movie referenced from a collection of movies; the classics that Sam Esmail adores as each and every cinephile out there. Each episode has a theme beautifully captured by unique visual story telling and daring story lines with impeccable performances. But there is a connective tissue that holds the whole show together, the loneliness in this ""social media"" era, and the ocean of silence that suffocates us within our phones and monitors and Facebook profiles and Instagram stories.
I can go on and on ... words do fall short hereWatch this masterpiece, savor every moment, study each shot, and enjoy this cinephile's dream coming true ... the dream of ingenuity.",positive
"""Mr. Robot"" is my absolute favorite series of all time!The acting of Rami Malek in particular is superb and he won an Emmy for it for a reason.The photography of the series is really special and has never done a series like this before.When it comes to photography, there's a lot of experimentation here.Contrary to the standard, characters are not placed in the middle, but at the edge of the screen.For example, an episode is filmed in such a way that it appears as if the entire episode is one shot.The story is brilliant and you don't see a single plot twist coming.I was a little afraid that the story wouldn't have a fair ending here, but quite the opposite: The ending is also brilliantly written and you can't see it coming.I can more than recommend Mr. Robot!!",positive
"@samesmail sir, sorry i need to tell something like this ""your crazy"". your art is absolutely mind blowing and everything you make is correct💯. thanks a lot from my deep inside my heart. one more, your really genius person, i cant wait for another waves from you. ~your friend.",negative
"Awesome, full of feelings series that displays a continuous succession of deep and rich emotions",positive
"Made an account just so I could give this show its well deserved 10/10 rating, everything about this show is absolutely brilliant, the acting, the cinematography, the characters, the plot.This is probably the best show I've ever seen and I cannot understand how it's only at an 8.5.",positive
"Just wanted to chime in to share to anyone wanting to get into this show. Yes when you get a taste of the pace of the show in season 1 you realize it's a little slow. Rami Malek is awkward and not everything is clear.What you have to keep in mind is that this show is written and directed by one person. That person knows where he is going with his plot so keep watching... In fact season 2 creates a lot of holes but in the end it's all voluntary. When season 3 unfolds , the blanks get filled , pretty much everything make sense and the end of the season is amazing. Good on Sam on knowing where he's going with this show and keeping it tight as season 4 will be the last and I think it make sense.I give the show a 9 only because of the pace sometimes but man , the direction is professional, unique and captivating.",positive
The story has a good momentum while keeping the viewer hooked. Mr. Robot seemed to be the war that is being waged by mind unto itself to all the illicit activities it has to bear from the society.,positive
"As somebody who has, at the time of writing, watched this show 7 times, I believe I am qualified to rate it. This show appeals to me in my interests but I can be certain that anyone watching the show can share the same joy as me.
The script is a masterpiece in screenwriting, it seems realistic in the events and the way they unfold, but the dialogue delivers subtle nods to the past in such clever and inventive ways that make every other show look like it was created by Tommy Wiseau. I greatly appreciate the attention to detail in making all the code and events realistic which other Hollywood projects have glanced over. Every character has their own flaws and charms from the magnificent main character of Elliot to the egotistical maniac, Tyrell.
Every episode will have one quote that would work well as an edgy teen's laptop background and can leave you thinking for days on a single subject. The way the story intertwines feels natural and pleasant that could make you feel like your right there with them. The cinematography is a work of art from the stand out scenes like in season 4's ""Don't delete me"", the season finale, ""Hello, Elliot"" or the very first episodes subway scenes. they work together in a beautiful way to drive the message of the show deep into your memory. The soundtrack to go along with it is perfect for the show, both in the original music, like ""what's your ask"", ""da3mons never stop"", ""a little push"" or the fantastic thumb cad in season 4; and the musical choices like ""steal my sunshine"" or the fantastic part the near the end with ""Mr Roboto"". They intertwine together perfectly to create a certain nostalgia for all the other times you hear them individually.
The director and creator, Sam Esmail, deserves so much more credit than what he has received from his work along with the music of Mac Quayle with it. The award show's choices to leave this masterpiece from their shows honestly disgusts me and has made me question my belief in any critic at all, along with the beliefs of this site. Rami Malek performed perfectly in this show and received a single nomination that resulted in an award. The other supporting cast members also performed to an insanely high standard and were given nothing in return. The Emmys of 2020 have really disappointed me in their choice to give it no awards and instead have opted for some of the worst picks imaginable for this year. I personally don't understand IMDb's community's choice for its placement, the average episode rating would put it in the top 5 shows of all time and its relevance in society could put it even higher but, as of now, this show is stuck in the top 200.
This show deserves so much appreciation and I really hope everyone here will give it a try. This is on the same level as breaking bad, I only hope that can be recognized some day.",positive
"One episode ago I was myself thinking ""the series is not perfect, but come on, there are so many hateful comments and too low ratings"". This time I wonder myself whether even to continues watching this. It's just became weak in every way.The corporations have no real security. Agirl can just enter the workplace, power on some computer and install the virus, without ever needing to register her presence. Half of the episode is spent on some high visions. The biggest corporation doesn't have a backup of it's data. The greatest hackers are some young emo problem-dealing teenagers. No one knows what a rootkit is in a security company. Well.. if you've watched it, you surely are aware of many more I don't have time to mention.The only way I see for this series to have such a high rating is that today are the times when anti-corpo and anti-capitalism topics are so on top and there's a great number of anti-system people who like that kind of series, even though logically it just sucks.",negative
"I didn't understand why is only 8.6 stars This series deserves more rating than 9 this series is better than the boys , Money heist",positive
"The many 9 and 10 ratings are on point with their reviews, the acting and story telling excellent! Elliot is actually taking you along on his journey, asking you questions along the line which was cool...I haven't seen much reviews on how the show talks about the world we live in today. It touches on all aspect of our society from religion, politics, the corporate world, etc. You'd be surprise of it's accuracy, and of course some will deny it cos their hypocrisy.I gave it a 9 now cos I wish it would have been just a little bit fast paced. I'm currently in second 2 so maybe that might change along the way.",negative
Mr Robot is unlike any form of entertainment I have ever watched. It is exhilarating and plays you right from the start. Every season there's new revelations that completely overthrow your previous perceptions about it. I would definitely like to revisit it sometime in the future too.Elliott is a very profound and intriguing character. All the characters present emotional vulnerabilities that would otherwise be difficult to confront in the type of show this is.I am thoroughly impressed by it.,positive
"I am very interested to see where this show will go. The person who left a 1/10 rating must not like technology/hacking/etc themed stuff (why did they watch it in the first place then!). I loved it. Hints of fight club/conspiracy theory stuff, but not too over the top. Overall, I love the sense of mystery coupled with the tech stuff, and will definitely be watching this one religiously. If you are at all into technology, especially the underworld of technology ie hacking, you will like this. If you like stuff that underlines the insanity of our dollar-based culture, elite basking in money while the poor suffer etc, you will like this show. Just watch it. It's good.",positive
"OK, so I work in security, protect networks and servers - maybe that is why I liked the first episode a lot. Damn I was looking forward to the continuation.But then 2'nd episode started slow, ended slow.From episode 3 - all have been lost and from 4 onward, just awful, violence, drop, no real focus. No red line, awful dialog, no red line, dark dysfunctional setting, dark really annoying ""music"" tracks to make up for lacking dialog.The people who apparently want to ""save"" the people who are not the 1% of the 1% of the 1% are social hackers, but I see no real technical skills.If it hard continued in the track from 1'st episode I would gladly had give a 7.",negative
"I just finished watching the entire show for the second time, and I was having a really hard time holding the tears in during the last episode.I used to think that the Emmys were the most credible of the major entertainment awards, but the fact that season 4 got ZERO nominations is criminal.",positive
"I waited Mr. Robot to be over, before writing a review, and finally after almost five years, I can express my opinion on one of the best series in years. It was hooked you from the beginning, until the very last episode. Sam Esmail is a very talented writer and was able to create an interesting story, by showing how much our society can be sick, and how a small group of rich and privileged people can decide the destiny of the majority of the worldwide population, or in this case of America.There are a lot of completely unexpected and very smart plot twists. You never know what is coming and especially when. The series is clearly very much inspired by Fight Club (thing that Esmail never hide), but at the same time is original and completely different. Every character is developed in the proper way, everyone has his back story and a credible psychological profile. The show breaks the fourth wall, sometimes in fact Elliot speaks directly to us and we are always able to listen his thoughts, what are his fears, which is his plan, why is going to do, or did something.The other positive aspect are interactions between different characters, thanks also to a very talented cast. Rami Malek is simply perfect in this performance, that launched officially his career in the Hollywood world. He deserves every single prize that is gaining. I am very curious to see him in the new Bond movie. BD Wong was able to give life to one of the most iconic character in TV history: Minister Zhang a.k.a Whiterose, along with Carly Chaikin as Darlene.Mr. Robot is not just another TV show, it is a deep analysis to the modern society and to fully understand all messages you need to watch more than once. Everyone can identify with Elliot in a way. Definitely one of the best series of this decade. I highly recommend it.",positive
Fantastic series. This show felt like if fight club merged with the matrix with a dash of requiem for a dream. The gist of it is quite simple. A hacker trying to take down a corrupt corporation. But that journey is filled with stories about friendship love and ultimately redemption. Great series. Highly recommended.,positive
Everyone must watch this. that's all i have to say,positive
"It felt like it should never have ended.... From the first to the last one, the level of suspense remains same. And Christian Slater absolutely outstanding performance. Probably the best show on amazon prime. I Highly suggest to everyone.",positive
"I don't usually post my reviews and I like to keep them to myself. But this time, for some reason, I feel forced to.Mr.Robot is a show about an Elliott Alderson, ""cyber security engineer by day, vigilante hacker by night "". now don't let the title neither the description fool you. If you're looking for some sci-fi or superhero-like material, then you're wrong. But whatever you're looking for, this show IS for you.First of all, I'd like to salute the brilliant mind of Sam Esmail who was able to craft an extravagant plot of philosophical pandemonium manifesting itself in 45 episodes that could be the new standard creators should look up to. The characters he's created, the writing, the themes prevailed, the tone...EVERYTHING was just perfectly painted by a brush of mastery.Second of all, the cast. Goes beyond saying, Rami Malek was able to play one of the most sophisticated characters ever created with all the depth, extremities and ""swings"". This man's professionalism exceeds the level presented at all these awards shows and I couldn't care less if he has one or 4 golden globes for playing Elliot because he's won actual respect from actual people of artistry.
Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin, Portia Doubleday, Martin Wallstrom, Stephanie Corneliussen and Grace Gummer are such a prolific choice to play their relative characters as well. Every scene was able to capture emotions beyond words.And out of huge respect to these criminally underrated talents, I say Kudos to B.D Wong, Michael Christopher and Elliott Vellar. THESE THREE SHOULD BE IN MORE MAJOR WORKS.Salute to the whole technical team, especially the cinematography -which I think you'd all agree that is VERY different than anything else on T.V or in Cinema. And it is the way it is for reasons you'd never think of- and the music, that is, what's the word...captivating ? Haunting? inducing? you name it.Despite the fact that Mr.Robot depicts hacking more accurately than anything else on t.v, we need to make it clear that this show is NOT ABOUT HACKING, just like superman isn't about wearing a cape and punching people. Hacking is just the instrument Elliott uses to.... "" C H A N G E T H E W O R L D ""and here's why this show is for you no matter what you usually prefer:This show is primarily about society. It studies humans, their interactions, their social life, constructs, standards, demands, lifestyle..and puts question marks on every aspect you can imagine.
ever been at a partyand started wondering why the hell are people happy about this very silly thing, but were to afraid to ask? well, this show does it for youThis show studies politics, economy with a beautiful approach to depict capitalism, terrorism, thought control, education, technology, etc.One of the MANY special things about this show is the way it depicts mental illness. True, and terrifying, and you get to live inside a mentally unstable individual's head for 45 episodes of T.V brillianceThanks again for Sam Esmail for that you've presented something out of this world. This show sure did ALOT to me and to other people, and I believe I speak for the rest of us when I say we need such characters like Elliott in T.V, movies, novels, and hopefully in real life, for that it's what keeps us going with hope and an eye for a better world for us.
This show will make you laugh, then cry, then terrified, struggling to catch your breath, at the edge of your seat, then probably screaming out of confusion, or speechless after mind-blowing epiphanies, assisted by excellent writing, proficient acting, and masterful directory.",positive
"You know the show is perfect when season 3 could also be the end of the season.The cinematography, the script and the performances are on another level, I really hope that more people watch this show.",positive
"This series keeps you on your toes for the next reveal. A series not only exploring the nature of power and money, but a long buildup explaining the psychology behind pain in all its forms. This is truly one of the best shows out there.",positive
This show has absolutely blown my mind and I think it may have ruined tv for me because I seriously doubt any show I watch fr now on can withstand the comparison. Sam Esmail is a true genius who does not tire of leaving a plethora of subtle hints from the first episode to the last.,positive
"Remember the old joke about going to a fight and seeing a hockey game break out? Well, this series is all about what happens when a concept that was originally intended to be a movie gets stretched into a TV series.The pilot was at least interesting, but it all goes south from there. As others have already pointed out, this is a hodgepodge of Fight Club, Dexter, The Matrix, and many many others. It's one thing to be influenced by other productions; it's quite another to just rip and rip and rip.But more than the ripoffs...this show is just a mess. The main character is a mess; everyone around the main character is a mess; the story is a mess; and most importantly, the 'message' is a mess: Anyone trying to confront the puppet masters of this world (the 1% of the 1%) is a raving lunatic self-loathing delusional emo suicidal junkie a-hole.Yet as bad as all of that is, maybe the worst part of this series is how it tries to pass itself off as intelligent high brow art, when all it really is, is bad TV making. (What's funny is to read all the fanboys and fangirls defend this utter rubbish in the comments section.)The acting is wooden at times and screechy at other times and 2nd rate most of the time. The direction is amateurish, over-relying on 'shocking sex scenes' (i.e. ""HEY...I'm in here peeing!!"" Pause. ""OK...I'll spread my legs for you"") and gimmicks like cliffhangers and plot 'twists' (i.e. ""I'm your dead father and I'm really dead"", ""I'm your sister and I'm really alive so stop kissing me"") -- OOOOOH. Don't buy into the hype and fake ratings/reviews. This show is definitely not 'all that'. What it IS is a convoluted story about a maladjusted depressed drug addict 'hacker' suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder) and Schizophrenia (he both hallucinates characters and embodies characters) who's fancies himself as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood who's going to save the world by destroying financial records/data of an evil conglomerate, thus eliminating 70% of the existing debt (money owed to credit card companies and mortgage companies, student loans, etc.) and creating in its wake a massive 'redistribution of wealth' the likes of which the world has never seen before. Make sense to you? No? Well, you have more sense than the creator of this ridiculous tortured fantasy.",negative
"My numerical vote is a combo of the pilot and the rest, averaging a too-high 5. However, what will come next is surely going to be much lower rated, as the uniqueness, power, intrigue and suspense of the pilot was lost in later episodes, all of which devolved into weirdness and murkiness and expressed sociopathy, which are not typically the best entertainment tools in a continuing story. Too much of that degradation is already in today's TV programming, and after seeing the pilot and thinking ""this is really different"", it all disappointingly collapsed into muddled junk not worth my continued interest to see where it all leads.",negative
"I just cannot believe what Sam Esmail created. I was kinda scared how this show gonna end, but he *nailed* it. Mr. Robot is one of the best tv-series ever done. And it has the most perfectly executed ending I have ever seen. To see how everything ties in perfectly, is the most satisfying thing to watch.
So glad that this tv-series has been developed",positive
"I got surprise by the total endings ....of Mr.robot season 4 episode 13 that it.... we should not imagine it.....how beautiful webseries placed by USA network...
Please do watch for real sense of world what is happening to this world and in this world",positive
"It is without any doubt one of the best shows ever made. Brilliant acting, unique story with so many inconceivably situations. Most of the shows get worse from season to season but not this one. Season 4 is a highlight with an final which will paralyze you do some days.
A must see!",positive
"Along with True Detectives Season 1 this is so far my favorite series ever. It just delivers to the very end and left me partly speechless.Most series just suffer from bringing the story to well deserved end (e.g. GoT, Lost) or get lost in endless episodes losing its momentum and becoming meaningless (e.g. Walking Dead). Not so Mr. Robot. It is just a great piece in tge history of modern cinema which you want to rewatch again.",positive
"One of the best TV shows I've ever seen, a true modern masterpiece with clear direction from start to end. Some of the best single episodes of TV come from this show like 407 Proxy Authentication Required, eps3.4_runtime-err0r.r00 and eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt.",positive
"It's the only show I've ever watched where every single detail was planned from the start. Esmail created a true modern masterpiece that has gone almost entirely unnoticed. The cinematography, the directing, the acting, the writing, the EVERYTHING, it's just utter perfection. Find the time in your life, no matter how busy you are, to watch this show.",positive
"Hello Friend,I don't usually write a review unless I feel the need to do it.This show is a pure form of Art.
I feel blessed to have witnessed such a beautiful creation. A show that connected with me on the deepest emotional level, and always left me striving for more, until, in the end, it offered me the highest level of satisfaction I have ever felt while watching a TV series.A big thanks to all the people involved in this masterpiece for this truly amazing, unparalleled experience.",positive
This show is masterpiece. It extremely written and designed as a full best series. The character played by Rami is extraordinary and awesome. Best show of the decade.,positive
"Like many others I started watching this show because of all the good reviews I had read. That and I have carried a massive girl crush for Christian Slater since the 90's.And also like so many others here I enjoyed the pilot, I thought it was unique, interesting and full of potential. And then the train plummeted off a cliff at a frightening speed.The main character went from being someone you felt for, like a small, lost child that needed your protection to a degenerate drug addict. His delusions went from quirky and thoughtful to manic & nonsensical. And this lack of relatability for the main character creates a real problem in that all the other characters (and there's far too many to keep anything straight) are completely unlikeable and in some cases downright depraved.Bottom line, I feel like I have to take a shower then view videos of kittens on YouTube after watching this.",negative
"This is definitely my favourite show at the moment.I was gripped from the very first episode and ended up binge watching Season 1 over 2 nights. When season 2 was on Amazon it killed me having to wait a week till the next episode.Rami Malek is brilliant as Elliot and you get a inside into his mind and world that just draws you into the show and grips you. The acting from all of the cast is amazing, with some plot twists that make you go wow.It is a show that will make you think, and requires your attention when watching but it is well researched and the subject area does not seem to be glamourised of falsified. Instead it is very dark and gritty.I loved the direction that season 2 took, and it added a whole new dimension to the dynamic of the show.",positive
"At this point mr Robot has suppressed any other television & I'm not even exaggerating. From writing to acting to directing everything about this show is top notch. Exceptional picture, sets, color scheme & that very own Sam Esmail camera angle touch to it that makes very easily any episode a visual cinema & story on its own, especially this last season. If I'm being honest I indeed had some love/hate relationship with this show through the seasons but Sam Esmail time and time again proved himself, to me at least, and had me speechless way too many times. The whole crew too. Rami being the main carrier of the strong act, hell all of them, all of them were scary this last season but this dude deserves any award I swear! Anywaysss this is how you end a television & everybody should take notes. Sam Esmail is such a class act. Well done dude well done!",positive
This incredible show peaked my interest in technology and started me on my journey to become a software engineer. From the accurate hacking scenes to the relatable main character this show made me feel like I was in the life of the main characters and when I was going through some dark times in my life this show showed me the beauty of life itself through the eyes of Elliot.,positive
"I am sure anyone who rated anything other than 10🌟's haven't seen the final season yet. Every episode of the final season is like a mini climax with incredible totally unexpected twists.The most amazing thing of the whole series is that it pulls you so much into the series that your brain just ignores small details, whose secrets when revealed so much later in the future episodes will make us feel truly ecstatic😍😲😘It's an awesome series which is ike nothing I had ever seen. It has something for everyone. It's a must be on top of everyone's watchlist",positive
"Elilot- ""They showed themselves, the top 1% of the 1%, the ones in control, the ones who play God without permission. And now I'm gonna take them down.""""How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, when it's as much a part of me as I am?""""There are some people out there... And it doesn't happen a lot. It's rare. But they refuse to let you hate them. In fact, they care about you in spite of it. And the really special ones, they're relentless at it. Doesn't matter what you do to them. They take it and care about you anyway. They don't abandon you, no matter how many reasons you give them. No matter how much you're practically begging them to leave. And you wanna know why? Because they feel something for me that I can't... They love me.""""We're all living in each other's paranoia.""""I've never found it hard to hack most people. If you listen to them, watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into their heads.""",positive
"In the age of lack of ""cinema"" Mr. Robot is a gift from above. Every frame was carefully crafted and well thought out that I didn't know was possible before I saw this show. There's a saying in the robot fandom that it has ruined every other show & movie for us. I compare everything I watch to Mr. Robot now & I don't understand the popularity of those shows where Mr. Robot remains underrated.",positive
"I'm not going to lie, from the middle of season 1 to the end of season 2 I wasn't convinced that this was my type of show. A little too arty and heavy on the jargon. Yesterday I finished the season 4 finale and have a new favourite series. If you're on the fence then binge-watch and persevere so that you can have the same experience I had! The only downside now is that I have nothing to watch that will compare...",positive
"This show is a masterpiece from start to finish. This exactly how you tell a story. Probably the best ending/reveal of all time. I just finish watching it for the second time around. It's definitely even better the second time. Once you know the ending then watch it again, you will see all the clues and how it connects throughout the whole series. Every character is interesting. The story telling that breaks the 4th wall submerged you into the world. Very little plot armor. The whole story was planned out so perfectly. Earlier seasons connects to the ending just so perfectly.",positive
"Conspiracy thrillers are a favourite of mine but this one represents what could be the pinnacle in that genre, and I've only watched one episode! The casting of Rami Malek as Elliot is perfect, he plays the socially awkward and terminally lonely hacker in a manner that is so utterly convincing it makes me feel uncomfortable.Even down to the music the atmosphere of this pilot episode is one of intensity and underlying angst that creates a real sense of foreboding and darkness.Mr Robot says to Elliot at one point ""Let me tell you why you're really here. You're here because you sense something wrong with the world"". Yes, very much so. And if the rest of the series is like this then I will certainly be watching it, avidly!",positive
One of my favorite shows. Love it! Rami is awesome!,positive
"At the season 2 premiere: The fight between fsociety and Evil Corp continues as the second season of Mr. Robot kicks off. Elliot (Rami Malek) has locked himself into a controlled routine. He keeps off his computer and only talks to his mother, his therapist, and his friend Leon (Joey Bada$$). Despite his efforts, he struggles to keep away from Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) . The hacker within begs to break out as the new continues to look dire after the actions of the first season.Darlene (Carly Chalkin) leads fsociety. The group has grown cocky after their initial success, but Darlene knows more than the others and knows they will have to keep working to take down Evil Corp, the bank that is as resilient and disgusting as cockroaches. Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) now works for ECorp as a press manager trying to manage the situation for the company she once hated. She's given up on her lawsuit and buying into her new position despite scorn from her coworkers.At the Season 2 Finale: The hit hacker show on USA concluded its second season tonight. Elliot (Rami Malek) continues to live in a delusional world as create Sam Esmail plays with viewers with an unreliable narrator. The biggest twist of this season was spoiled a little earlier by very accurate fan theories, which is why I try not to read too much about shows before the finale. I would highly recommend not continuing to read this review if you don't want the second season spoiled because I plan to write openly about the events of the second season all the way up to the finale.My favorite addition to the second season was the character Dominique DiPerro and the brilliant acting of Grace Gummer. The show really benefited from her performance and most of her scenes contained plenty of awesome action sequences that took me totally by surprise right at the end of several episodes. Most of these scenes involved intense shootouts that were shot beautifully and ratcheted up the suspense to another level. Another great addition to the show was Joey Bada$$ as Leon, Elliot's fellow inmate who can slice some throats.The show slowed down dramatically in the second season drawing out the plot and taking strange twists and turns as Elliot moved on from his realization that his father Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) was only a figment of his imagination. His sister Darlene (Carly Chaikin) strikes ou on her own to try and advance the agenda of fsociety but finds herself in over her head.

"Alright, I don't even know where to start!This series gives you so many twists and turns, it goes from 0 - 100 and vice versa in just a second, you never know what's gonna happen.
You never know how a character will react to a certain situation.
It's highly predictable, it will get you on the hook!
It will force you to think about so much, it will not let you wander off, this show was sure as hell amazing!
Watched it pretty late but I'm glad i did",positive
"""Mr. Robot"" is truly one of the best series I have ever seen. It simply has everything a series has to have. Drama, depth, cleanly worked out characters, successful psychologisations, and a fabulous Plottwist. I can without hesitation claim that Mr. Robot has become one of my favorite series. I never expected Amazon to compete with the big others like Netflix and Co but with ""Mr. Robot"", they have managed to make a hit.What impressed me the most? Above all the cleanly elaborated, fascinating and authentic figure ""Eliots"". For a moment I did not doubt that the actor really possesses these diseases. I could easily get into the protagonist character, became him, and sympathize. Furthermore because the protagonist is someone who could almost be characterized as an anti- hero, one would like to share his weaknesses with Eliot. At the same time he seems familiar and amiable. One would start with Eliot together the journey into the unknown.Finally, I give ""only"" 9/10 possible points, because the series is already to be noted that it has a smaller budget than many other series. Some performers do not seem very convincing or overestimate their role. Too bad. However, it does not in any way impair the geniality as a whole.Please excuse my bad English.",positive
"Just finished this fantastic series , iam mind blown .
I think this show gave me new neural pathways to my mind.",positive
"What is reality? There are some movies and series out there trying to trick your mind, so you get off usual path of thinking, and you get that eerie feeling.Like The Matrix, eXistenZ or Mr Robot. Except in Mr Robot it's layer after layer is exposed to you sometimes in delicate way, sometimes hits you hard, sometimes leaving much to interpretation.It's rare poetry in modern mainstream cinema, and you don't need to be snobbish to experience that and get entertained, feel that loneliness in crowd of main character, his disorientation, determination or despair.It's all like a symphony of World confusion about what to do next with our lives and civilisation. A must see for every sensitive soul out there.",positive
"Hands down this show has the best cinematography of all time, the best actors of all time and such an amazing storyline.. If you enjoyed ""Dexter"" , you'd love this aswell!",positive
"Everything about the show is amazing, thrilling and emotional. There are no boring episodes, i loved every singel one of them. Not the typical tv show. Mind Blowing!",positive
OmG this show is one of the greatest things that ever existed its just beauty. You don't need an action to just make the story looks awesome... The storylines itself are so freaking amazing holy **** i adore this so much. If you watched it you know my feelings about it. If you don't.. What the heck are you waiting for?. Sam esmail is the greatest TV writer and director ever he's a genius. And rami malek?? HE'S A GREAT ACTOR.,positive
"I'm a tech. Spent my whole career writing code in a dozen different computer languages. Worked as a one man bomb squad defusing worms & viruses for major Wall St. institutions. Writing algorithms was like a form of poetry for me. I love Silicon Valley. Think it's brilliant. Often I'll freeze the screen to savor the logic diagrams the guys have on their whiteboards.If SV is post-grad, Mr. Robot barely makes 3rd grade. The writing is shallow & predicable. The performances are amateurish & devoid of all intelligence & humor. Why are the majority of the main characters portrayed as teenage pseudo-hipsters? Probably because that's MR's target audience.",negative
I just finished watching Mr. Robot and will most likely be spending some time reeling over it and trying to piece it all together. It's just...mind blowing. I don't think I've ever watched a show that tripped me out like this. I do have some questions that I guess only my imagination can answer but holy cow...this was a great watch. It was a wild ride from start to finish.,positive
"My opnion from the Mr.robot is a masterpiece. I think Everyone must to see the Mr robot, because its not just a simple hacker story, This is a recovery story. You will know that Eliot how to recover from his illness. Rami Malek is not a simple actor what this guy did in this series it was fantastic but of course the others were great but not so much than Rami Malek. The Final season has a great ending for the Mr.robot.",positive
"The final season is actually a work of art. It's been a couple year since the finale, and all I can say is I am baffled that this show has been slept on like it has. I would argue that the finale season stands up as one of the best season of a television show ever made, but it seems hardly anyone as actually watched it. I think most people dropped it in the 2nd ,or 3rd seasons for fair reasons, but boy are they missing out.",positive
"Sums up Mr. Robot: ""...attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed."" Yes. This show is wrapped in slick packaging. Filmed very well. Great scenery. Slow-moving plot. Lots of (ultimately superficial) introspective monologues.But none of that masks the central flaw of this show: they're constantly trying to force a square peg in a round hole. Hackers are not military-trained field agents, clever CIA intelligence analysts...or remotely hip people. But this show wants to pretend they're one or all of those things.You've got Egyptian James Bond, Jewish hipster Barbie, Hijab-wearing Mrs. Spock, Street corner hustler, Bi-Curious daddy's girl...and God only knows how many more Politically-Correct caricatures they've got in store.Oh, but of course it's the 21st century. So all heroes have to have weird (but ultimately superficial) neuroses. Why? So we can have contrived crying fits, sad monologues, unnecessary arguments...basically drama people.Is having contrived drama a fatal sin? No it's not. Not when the show is rooted in something real & authentic. But this show is not rooted in anything real.What I find particularly appalling is the big ""Anonymous"" logo at the beginning of each episode. With that, and the overarching story-line (Hackers vs. Evil corp)...the show clearly wants audiences to associate the show with the Anonymous/WikiLeaks zeitgeist.But if you have even a basic understanding of what those movements are, who they compose of, and what they actually do...you have to laugh at nerve of these Mr. Robot people. They're basically doing a Broadway re-telling of 'Oceans 11' or 'Gangs Of New York'...only with hipster hackers as the protagonists.Wasn't Angelina Jolie ridiculed for similarly ridiculous Hacker movie early in her career? I am sure that if they dragged out the story & hyped up the ""quirkiness""...that crap would have enjoyed the same ""8.8"" rating Mr. Robot currently has on IMDb.",negative
"As per Hollywood usual men are having sex with men and every female is a closet lesbian when the opportunity arises. The direction is terrible with extremely off-center shots which some director probably thinks are edgy and stylistic. I see the same extras walking by in many outdoor scenes. They have different clothes but the same shoes. Sloppy. No effort.It's just as generic and predictable as any previous shows involving hackers, but with even more drama clichés. Sad.The music is like a poor excuse for a Jesper Kyd knock-off. Often unfitting, especially the 'rock' segments of loud and entirely unfitting music which usually gets cut off instantly.Constant mumbling and build ups to nothing, terrible things happening for the sake of luring the viewer to watch the next episode where nothing significant happens either.An obnoxious amount of filler - prolonged drone shots, mundane chatter, to fill up that 1-hour mark and waste everyone's time and life.No like-able characters whatsoever. I've lost all interest during season two. There's no one to root for in this. It's just borderline depressing for the sake of appearing 'deep'. Overdoing something won't make it better.This show is draining (and expects) too much emotional investment and none of those emotions are good. It doesn't reward with anything. No plot progression. Just one bad thing after another, no continuity, hoping that's enough to keep people watching and pretending they find it deep when it's just lazy.All of it's significance was drained in the first few episodes, now it's just the same filler repeating. If you want to be depressed over and over by the same things repeating (the 'definition of insanity' - ironically mentioned in the movie) then keep watching and wasting your time.I want to point out that Rami and Martin Wallström especially I feel are fantastic actors - in fact too good to be playing those terrible characters in this pointless show along with it's mediocre cast outside of them two.",negative
"My new favorite series , and i watch tons of them but this one ... man this one is a masterpiece , i honestly can't find a flaw .I never got bored along the way
i never rewatched one of the many series i watched , i always prefered exploring new grounds but man ... i intend to let this series hack me again and again ! Thank you to the genius behind it.",positive
My first review about any movie or show is this one cuz Mr. Robot left me with no choice. I am actually sad i will not see Elliot Anymore 😭 btw Outstanding performance by Mr. Alderson.,positive
"After watching the first episode of ""Mr. Robot"", it was not clear where the story was leading. Sure, there are the usual sophomoric generalizations about all corporations being greedy and, therefore, evil, but much of the action and the judgments are related via the main character, Elliot, and he is a mentally ill, drug-impaired social misfit. So it wasn't clear what point of view the show would eventually take.Now that I have watched three episodes, I am ready to call it quits. I always argue that you have to be patient with new shows and give them a chance to develop before passing judgment. But there is a limit, a personal choice every viewer must make. Maybe you are one of those people who kept watching ""Lost"" or ""Under the Dome"" and were glad you did, but I really need something compelling to make me watch a show with no clear aim or point of view. That is especially true when the show is a depressing slog through a grey world of illegal drugs and illicit activities and the main character drones on about his (muddled) ideas of justice and sin, which are constantly self-contradictory.Elliot has anger issues, he hates his job, he self medicates, he goes to an analyst that he lies to, and he decries a world of people who fill their lives with inanity and electronic (rather than real world) interactions yet he exists primarily in the hacker's world. Such a dystopian view of the world might be easier to watch if the show had a clear-eyed hero, like the film ""V is for Vendetta"". Or if the show had more to say about consumerism than ""it sucks"", like the film ""Fight Club"". Or if it created a compelling reality, like ""The Matrix"".The writers like to subvert Adam Smith's insightful concept of the Invisible Hand and use it to name Elliot's concept of a force in society that is a conspiracy theorist's nightmare--a force that holds the ""common man"" down so that the richest members of society can acquire more money and spend it in ways that Elliot does not approve of.In ""Mr. Robot"", Robin Hood is an anti-social savant or maybe he's the Christian Slater character actually dubbed ""Mr. Robot"", who wishes to use Elliot because he has inside access to the Evil Corporation that is the source of the world's problems, and because Elliot is a very moldable mess of clay who can be twisted to any end.What really makes me not want to watch the show any further is its ignorance of its own values. Evil Corporation is, of course, evil primarily because it is without values--its dedication to the concept that the ends justify the means. But Elliot, Mr. Robot and his f-society are willing to steal, invade privacy, destroy property and do whatever else it takes to take down status quo society. They too believe the ends justify the means. In the end, we have an immoral straw man against an immoral opponent. This is not a battle I am interested in.",negative
"I have been watching since the 1st episode aired and I love it it's one of my favorite show.
It's on point, it's real, and believe me when I say this I am a software engineer and the way they show the hacking that is real that is how it's done not like majority movies where hackers have there own ""AI"".
My favourite episode in the entire tv show history was Ozymandias now it's 407: Proxy authentication required the best episode ever to be aired on a tv show it's better than major highly rated movies. Seriously the writing, acting, direction, screenplay all is perfect, there is nothing more anyone could or would ask.
Please watch this series we need more of this and less of superhero stuff, the real deal.",positive
"First off, can't believe Hollywood was able to pull of what realistic hacking looks like, after decades of graphics mumbo jumbo.If you are programmer or a professional pen-test guy, you will love it a bit, seeing all the tools that you use daily. It's not perfect but its quite good.Second, after Season 1, the show went to rambling its LIBERAL PROPAGANDA about Non-Binary Sex, Anti-Trump n0n-sense and it keeps getting worse and worse ...I don't understand ... why can't we have a decent entertainment without any political bias .. Then again, who am I kidding ...All in all .. great show... After season 1... its draining down the rabbit hole",negative
This is one of the best series I have had the pleasure of watching in a very long time. The character building and development was engaging and the twisting of reality through Elliot's phases of personalities was intriguing as they adjusted to his environment around him. The first 10 episodes set the stage for a rollercoaster ride beginning in episode 11 and I was hooked watching those personalities develop. I often wondered if the true Elliot would be revealed and I found my answer in the finale a very perfect moment ending and yet still a little let down as I would of enjoyed after 4 seasons a glimpse of the real Elliot interacting with his world. Kudos to Esmail for this brilliant work I would enjoy maybe a short but sweet look into the real Elliot's world any hope in a future reprise shorty?,positive
"Mr. Robot is a bit tough to rate due to the drastic difference between its first half and second half. After the first two seasons, it would've been a firm 6 - there's enough great production value and acting to have it be watchable, but the plot was more random convoluted character actions than anything to really attach to. Seasons 3 and 4 are great television, with ample tension and psychological complexity that was lacking previously. All of the characters I love in Mr Robot shine in seasons 3 and 4 - White Rose is absolutely amazing, especially after understanding their devastating history; Irving is an absolute legend; Tyrell is really fun; and driving the plot forward is Elliot, who we grow to understand much better and who has much more clearly defined goals and psychology. The ending does tie everything together beautifully, as we finally understand who Elliot is and how his past affected his psychology. Throughout the show you'll get creative camerawork, great acting, and great production value across the board, but once you get into seasons 3 and 4 the show evolves into one of the best on television. Really interesting that it was originally conceived as a movie, I would've been curious to see how that looked and if it could've been fleshed out well enough to be really affecting. Mr Robot is a really smart and creative show, but its enduring messages are much more about psychological trauma than inequality and corruption like I expected.",positive
"I understand the demographic this is aimed at. Slacker boys, children despite being in their 20's, who are in debt up to their eyeballs and want to blame somebody else for their poor choices.Certainly, I am troubled that so much of the world's wealth is in the hands of so few people. Certainly, I understand how impossible it is to make a dent in the plutocracy. So you think I might like this – but I don't. I have no debt, for I don't spend money on stupid stuff that is advertised to me--nor indeed expose myself to ads. I watched this DVD via my public library. I'm sure the intended audience downloaded each episode for 2.99 or pays 300 bucks a month for cable or satellite. Put it on the credit card, and boo-boo it's all somebody else's fault they can't pay it off. Well, spoiled little boys, bite me. If you want to disengage from the Evil Co.s of the world, kill your TV, get a second job, pay off your debt, and quit watching this pandering nonsense to convince yourself you aren't responsible for your choices. Oh, and bite me.Did the main actor actually take morphine on each day of filming? If not, he is doing a good job of portraying that. That's all I can say positive about this mess.",negative
"I, like many others, thought the pilot was phenomenal. It showed a computer security software tech, Elliot, who wanted to make a revolutionary change in the world using hactivision and to take down an ""evil"" corporate empire. I was looking forward to a new fantastic show about how computers and technology —and the people in the field/hobby, can make a huge impact in the world.Immediately after the pilot —in the subsequent episodes, the show took an instant plummet. The plots became all about selfish self-loathing shallow characters in desperate and pathetic overly-dramatic situations. It became focused on excessive hardcore drug use, low-life lifestyles and ghetto drama, and intentional use of ""shocking"" topics such as homosexuality, beating up a homeless man for no reason other than to show someone is psycho, and cheating. These topics are COMPLETELY opposite to what is appealing to most people interested in computers and technology, so I'm confused as to who this show is trying to appeal to.The narration reminds me of Dexter, but what is said is mostly nonsense and not nearly as sophisticated. The audio is off on the show, the music is so loud that it overpowers the dialog. The actors sometimes mumble or talk too fast and it's difficult or impossible to hear what they say.The writing is all over the place, it's like they are trying to take what has worked from different shows and mesh it into this show, but it just doesn't work. I think it's pathetic when shows always try to have a ""catch"" right at the end of an episode, it becomes way too predictable and boring, and they have done lots of that so far.I do like the music and cinematography, those are great and highly appropriate.The ""FSociety"" group have been setting up shop in abandoned arcades, but the show has not shown anything about video games! It's like they're trying hard to make the show seem cool. If they stopped focusing on drug abuse and addiction and started focusing more on computers and video games and that lifestyle then the show would have a lot more appeal.But overall this show has quickly become a disappointment and is drifting away from what most have hoped for. It is not a show that is centered on technology, hacktivision, digital revolution, and the computer lifestyle that so many are craving, and instead is becoming just another mindless TV drama hoping to shock viewers with outlandish situations.",negative
"Im so sad I finished this show, I could watch 10 seasons of it! Recommended!",positive
You'll become a different person after watching this show. A beautiful show in my opinion.,positive
"To be honest this show is quite under rated on IMDB. This deserves to have a rating above 9. Most people might have rated this down after watching 2nd season, in which initially the story felt quite slow. But trust me it has an excellent scene Poppin up ahead. This show apart from the main hack also tells us more about human vulnerabilities and how everyone has a dark side and that too can be tapped virtually. It is not any other normal tv show.
It is the best show ever made.",positive
I rewatched it after I finished it. It really is that good! My expectations for the last season were very high. I gotta say they exceeded it - big time.,positive
"Greatest show on television, absolutely brilliant what Sam Esmail has done, somehow surpassing himself season by season.",positive
"When I read synopsis/plot/reviews and saw such a high rating, I believed and wanted this series to ""wow""me. Well at least be interesting enough to watch. Well, I was very disappointed. I did what the entire lengthy pilot. I gave it a chance even though it didn't feel right from the get go. It's like it was created by no talent hacks on a whim. It has every cliché in the book and is painfully predictable. I watched the second episode and it went from bad to horrible. BTW, this is my genre and it is a relevant topic of today's society, but it's very poorly written and very poorly acted. Even with Christian Slater in it. I know that my review means nothing, because there are obviously thousands of IMDb users that loved it. I just had to say my piece.",negative
"A different story, an original script and just an amazing performance, this series means too much to me and is generally the best.If you ever decide that you want to watch something different, a great recommendation from me.",positive
"Mr. Robot is a complex show to watch. It's main plot is always changing, you'll be surprised with every single episode you watch, and it's all because of Sam Esmaili.Sam did a PHENOMENAL job directing this series, he made sure that every single detail was included in the show without making it feel like it was unnecessary.Character development is just sensational, Rami Maleks acting confirmed he's one of the most talented actors nowadays, and with a great supporting cast along the way, he truly made us believe in Elliots journey, while feeling his emotions just as he is living them at the moment.This TV show doesn't have the ratings nor the popularity it should have, i believe it's one of the true hidden gems of all television history, and anyone searching for a high thrilling, plot twisting, tv show with great acting and even better directing should consider jump on Mr. Robots bangwagon.I truly enjoyed this show and im hopping Sam Esmaili decides to direct another show in the near future, cause he's a GENIUS.",positive
"I laugh at all the reviews from back in 2015 giving this show 1 or 2 star ratings.
They should of stuck with it and came along with us on this mind bowing journey of ground breaking tv. It truly is a masterpiece from the writing, directing and most of all the acting.
A big thank you to everyone that worked on the show",positive
Extremely brilliant show. It deserves to be in top 10 !!,positive
"This is an amazing drama if that's what u can call it. Rami malek awesome acting as usual. The writers did a tremendous job
Favourite was season 3 episode 6 at 35th minute I laughed my head off at this.",positive
"Hello, friend. This is my first ever review after more than 10 years. I just had to tell you the following: Mr. Robot is a show that's so brilliantly constructed over the course of 4 seasons that it can and will unleash it's full power in it's final episodes and let me tell you this: You will definitely love the final 5 episodes of it! They are mindblowing and highly emotional and make this series a real masterpiece. Sam Esmail knew from the very beginning of the first episode of season 1 where all this would end and that's what makes it so satisfying to watch it all come to an end. An end you'll never forget in your life! Hell, that was a ride! Rami Malek will forever be connected to Mr. Robot when I see his face. Astounishing acting that will break your heart once you open it up for it. Enjoy it.",positive
"The story goes very well, but in the second season you may be confused.",positive
There are scenes that are pretty questionable that I wish could have been executed in a better way but this show really can speak to so many people because it tackles so many societal issues that no one really has the courage to talk about. Paired with relevant issues and a phenomenal cast this show is a marvel to witness,positive
"I am not generally prone to hyperbole. But now that it's over I can safely say this is the best TV series I've ever watched, possibly the best thing I've seen in any cinematic medium. I hope the criminally low overall rating of 8.5 climbs to something more deserved. A quick glance at the individual episode ratings and the season on season improvement tells you everything you need to know about the quality of this show.Of course these things are subjective, it won't be for everyone and some reviewers will keep lamenting a few loose ends that were not fully explained. For me these do not matter. Everything does not always need to be tied up in a nice spoon-fed bow. Some nuance and viewer interpretation is allowed, especially given the level at which all we were given operated.The word 'masterpiece' gets banded about far too often, but Mr. Robot is a masterpiece. Every aspect of it...the acting, script, cinematography, score...everything is on point. If you can't just sit back and appreciate the genius of this show, I feel bad for you. Thanks to Sam Esmail and everyone involved - I'm sad it's over, but privileged I got to enjoy it.",positive
"The cast is entertaining and made the boring parts somewhat more enjoyable to watch, Rami Malek and Christian Slater are most definitely the standouts of the show.The pilot was so awesome and got me hooked straight away, from the third episode onwards it gets kind of boring and repetitive until the seventh episode when things kicked right back into gear and the final three episodes returned to the awesomeness of the first episode.It was about five or six episodes in until I realized that Carly Chaikin, who played Dalia Royce on Suburgatory, played Darlene.It does kind of make you think how much you put on the Internet, how easily accessible it is to anyone who knows how and just how much of everyday life can be ruined via the Internet. I also like how the episodes are titled after video files.",negative
"I watched most of the top series like game of thrones, breaking bad,sopranos,true detective and but it's the best serie i have ever seen
Everything in this serie is perfect such as music acting and specialy cinematography and an amazing ending i truly can say it's the best and perfet serie i have ever seen.",positive
Knows where it's going right from the start and follows through with every setup. 10/10,positive
I just started season one today and I am on episode 5 somehow I just got stop watching it it's constantly on my mind as of now ( not being dramatic ) I recommend it,positive
"Thjs series is on Top 1 of my favorite series ever watched. I have 70+ series last 5 year. Rami performance was amazing. I like the story, cinematography, production quality. It is pyscho-techno-thriller series. Usually I don't like drama genre, Bt this show I didn't feel about it.",positive
"Hello friend. I want to tell you that I think this will be one of the best shows I'll ever watch. However, I don't want to be too extreme to create an unrealistic expectation of it. I will say, that I have followed this show since the very start, and along the way it has been one of the most creative, focused, and oddly relevant shows I've ever seen. It takes risks, and deals with big topics (mental illness, trauma, society, power, control, god, etc) in a way that's important to see. Mr Robot's complex story sometimes feels like it doesn't matter, because there's a simple, overall message that the show is trying to get across. This message isn't insanely novel, but the way it says it is. And, it's something we all need to get told. Despite that, the complex story is well done and worth watching. Hell, it is worth watching again to see what you missed/didn't realize the context for. Pay attention, because there are things that happen early which still affect the end game. Please, enjoy it. I think it will affect you in as positive of a way that it has for me. Thanks for reading",positive
"The pilot centers around Elliot, 20-something guy who probably has a form of high-functioning autism, which isolates him from society, makes him withdraw into the world of computers, and he naturally becomes a genius hacker.There have been a number of shows and films about people who are not NT(neurotypical), like ""Monk"" and ""Numbers"" and ""Beautiful Mind"", and even the martial arts film ""Chocolate"" - however, they managed to portray their heroes as sympathetic. After all, if you don't sympathize with the hero, what's supposed to hold your interest? In this show, nothing does.This dude reads private Emails of people he ""protects"" (without their consent, of course). He has no life, at all, and therefore lives through controlling THEIRS, in textbook example of severe, long-neglected, codependence syndrome.He believes work is slavery and corporations are the slave owners. He wants ""redistribution of wealth"". The idea of erasing people's credit card debts makes him feel funny in the pants. Because it's not your responsibility to decide to borrow or manage your finances, no - it's the ""corporation's fault"".This show would've been welcomed with open arms in my former homeland - USSR - just as any show that bashed capitalism or showed the West in a bad light. We lived without toilet paper, but at least we were free of corporations who produce it!:|But I digress...The show portrays Elliot as some sort of righteous warrior, but really he's an overgrown child.We're supposed to sympathize with him not because of his personality - he has none - but because of his mental condition. The show does the autism spectrum no favors here by showing the hero as socially crippled, with minimal life skills, and drowning in angst.Instead of portraying autistics as ""different"", it shows him as ""broken"", with no real outstanding character qualities or insights to compensate for his flaws. Yes, he can hack. At society's expense.Not only is this show's ""hero"" a creepy simpleton, the overeager simplicity infects the entire show.His friend, who works with him at a CYBERSECURITY COMPANY, doesn't know what a ROOTKIT is. He has to explain it to her, because, apparently, she's stupid because... she's a woman? Really? The ""enemy"" in this show is the ambiguous, all-controlling ""E CORP"", which is constantly referenced verbally as ""EvilCorp"". Yes, really.The evil CTO of ""EvilCorp"" is MOST DEFINITELY evil because he talks rudely to the hero's friend.The hero goes to psychiatrist, who genuinely tries to help him. Instead, he, despite being chock-full of psychological issues, zones out during her visits and thinks about the photos he saw after hacking into her Facebook.So the hero hacks his psychiatrists' new date. The date is a BAD GUY, because he has a wife, history of cheating, and he pulled up his dog by the leash when the dog misbehaved.The dog trait was given to him to make him, you know, EVIL.The hero has to protect his psychiatrist from this ""self-destructive dating pattern"", while being completely oblivious just how messed up, creepy and delusional HE is.The show starts with by preaching about the ""1% of the 1%""... i.e. ""down with the bourgeoisie!"", and it never really stops. It is aimed at the easily impressionable, the idealistic, the college students who don't understand work, or financial responsibility, and believe world history started when they were born.Down with the system! Down with the corporations!Of course, the show itself was made by a corporation and is aired thanks to a corporation, and it was made to make money from the same naive audience who applauds abolishing corporations.I give it 3 stars instead of 1, because it's filmed well, and it's trying to have a plot.Except that plot revolves around a codependent, isolated, angsty Peeping Tom with no understanding of history, politics or math.",negative
"Great story, great acting, great character build ups. Prepare to get your mind blown in almost every episode of season 3 and 4. But here's the catch : you'll have to survive the first two seasons. S01 is a decent watch, but quickly becomes straight outta Fight Club. S02 is the most boring season of the lot. Could've even reduced it to 10 episodes.Just be patient and trust me the rewards that you'' get are fantastic.",positive
"Woah, I don't know what to say about this one. It's a masterpiece crafted by Sam Esmail, and brought to life by the extremely good actors.It gives hacking a (semi) realistic portayal, and doesn't fault itself with Hollywood mambo jambo, sure it's a bit glorified and made to look cool for screen, but it's still pretty damn well done.Rami Malek is the perfect actor for Elliot.The show also portrays mental illnesses really well, as it does with addiction too, withdrawal and so on.All in all, I do recommend this show for all of you.",positive
Awesome. The amount of times I've been wide eyed & awe-struck at this show. The quality is exceptional!!,positive
"I rated this show a solid 8 for the first two seasons.This season, it has gotten so very dark and very abstract weird, and I'm not enjoying it, anymore! It doesn't make sense.Elliot was the good guy, in the beginning - outing pedophiles to the police, to be specific. He was a hero, and was going to use his skills for good. What the hell has he turned into?! What a perverted mess, the show is now. There isn't *one* character in the series I find likable.I have to qualify that I think almost every actor is awesomely talented, it's the writing I'm disliking.I'm sorry, just too weird now.",negative
"as usual in series, season 2 fails to meet expectationsHacker is addicted to drugs and psychotic. - evil corps and security services are always working to conquer the world. - no real action than just a boring and slow process of character development to present ... really what are they trying to present? What is the set of questions that are brought for thinking here? Hackers trying to take over the world while some others try to do the same with other means?Too bad.. first season was indeed something that was working viewers interest and scaled up reactions to a dramatic end. This season we still have not seen a scenario/plot forming up rather than a presentation of each person's story.",negative
"I was hooked with Episode one, immediately hitting second and third episode. However, that's the extent of my enjoyment. The show took a turn into a psychology mind twist from there on. I went into the show hoping for a technology and hacking focused story where we go on an adventure of the internet and the troubles around it. Instead, it was exploration of a questionable mind, I won't go too far into details to avoid spoilers, but the main plot point of episode one is lost by episode five. Disappointed",negative
"Wife and I started watching the first season. The first two episodes were good enough to capture our attention pretty well, but put me to sleep, or at least really tired and sleepy after watching them.The third episode disgusted me. I'm sorry but graphic male gay sex is NOT something I find in the least bit entertaining, I'm not even a guy who likes heterosexual sex scenes, call me a prude, but I don't find watching other people having sex entertaining...and I'm a pretty liberal guy, just never was a porn consumer. The third episode also introduces a pregnant woman requiring her man to perform S&M...tying her up, etc.. So, while I really don't have a problem with what people do behind closed doors between consenting adults, I really don't find it entertaining as television or movie watching.Throughout the first 5 episodes (we never watched any more), the main character deals with morphine addiction, I don't mind this, or the violence, etc..I told my wife after watching the third episode, that I was done with the show, the male gay sex scene was something I hoped I could drink out of my brain, but I said if she was still interested...and she was still mildly interested...we would continue. Well, after episode 4 and 5 she had enough. It just went in to a mentally bizarre mode with psychotic jumping around between visuals and scenes and is simply not good entertainment.I have to admit, this show is like a car wreck, you know its ugly but you cant take your eyes away from it, its riveting, but also really sick. We stopped after the 5th episode. This is not ""entertainment"" for us.",negative
"I consider 3 shows to be completely flawless masterpieces. These are : Breaking Bad, Dark and Mr. Robot. Of these 3 shows, or rather of the plethora of shows I've seen, Mr Robot is has the highest quality of cinematography and social commentary. Never put a foot wrong, while giving you some of the greatest TV moments in history. All of these shows are must watch! I'm surprised Mr Robot has an 8.5 rating, it deserves so much more.",positive
"I have watched many shows and movies like this. Hackers and similar are presented always the same - somewhat misunderstood, depressive, very smart, antisocial and of course anxious with tendencies to suicide, drugs and other stimulants. (Ofcourse, Slater doesn't exist, if you asked for) And story about big ""evil corp"" and fight against it is also seen million times... but that's all OK, tolerably. Something much worse bothers me. Or to say - buggin' me? I am asking why pushing someone's sexual preference in all series for young people? I'm surprised that the Jews, who are usually producers of almost all TV series in USA and a very rigorous on issues of homosexuality pushed this shameless display of almost pornographic, homosexual acts. While many today are afraid to say this: me personally, I'm disgusted with that and I think it's wrong, it's not good to push constantly in all series. No more series where at least no bare butt, gay or lesbo sex, even unhidden vagina and penis, in full motion. What's next - open sexual acts at 5 pm in the program for young children? The producers of the series in the third episode of Mr.Robot are just a step away from pure gay pornography and so now I will stop watch this show and I would not recommend to anyone. But I know you Americans do not understand why we are against it, because you are brainwashed with thousands of similar gay-ish pictures through all media, for decades now. They started with soft-porn, just some legs and tits, and now in USA everything is just sex, sex, sex... Sex sale everything, to stupid masses. I don't care if you are homosexual or not, or whatever you are, just leave me and my children be. Thank you.",negative
"This show will really mess with you. Just when you think you know something, you realize you don't. The writer(s) are seriously on another level and honestly feels like they're trying to tell us something. The shows pretty relatable to what's going on rn and prophetic in a way. Not to mention the psychological war going on in the protagonists head. I think it might be the greatest show made sorry Breaking Bad... this show is brutal and dark as hell so prepare yourself.",positive
"I can say this is quite underrated, but it is seriously a masterpiece. The plot is perfectly written, and it's very hard to find the loopholes. Honestly, the genre is not my usual preference. It's a bit confusing with the whole technical jargons while the plot is not straight forward and quite complicated at the same time. So, I'm pretty sure this is not for everyone, and I could say this wasn't for me at first. But I just keep going, and all the plot twists really surprise me.Besides, all twists are also very realistic and sensible at the same time but they are still able to surprise me in a unique way. On top of that, Rami Malek is just so brilliant picturing the ""characters"". Though this is my first series about complicated technology in hackers' world, with the addition of economic, social and politic issues, but I can't deny that is so brilliant!",positive
"The first few episodes are great. They seem realistic and plausible. Something that could happen at your local city centre.Then the whole series starts to unravel around the half way point....A murder happens that involves one of the main characters....but he simply tells the police that he's too busy to talk to them. Not bloody likely.Then it turns into a Fight Club rip off (they actually play music from the movie to make the connection).After watching the whole first season, I am extremely disappointed. I thought this was going to be a really great show. But by the end I can tell I won't watch another episode. It's just too far fetched, and stretching to make the story exciting.It has the opportunity to delve into the technical aspects of how the main character is able to hack into other people's lives, but instead it focuses on the outlandish.",negative
Very very good series. It really was ground breaking. I felt it lost it's momentum around the third season but ending up coming back around in the fourth with a strong conclusion. One of the best series every created.,positive
"Based on the first episode only: The lead actor and his embrace of this character are the real strengths of this show.This is not the show for someone seeking action and special effects. A key tool used to tell the story is a running inner monologue of the main character and as such we could describe this episode as being more cerebral than many television shows but it is an approach to storytelling that some will not appreciate.There are tropes that appear - males blackmailed for porn/prostitution, childhood friendship unrealized as an adult romance, evil mega-corporations, and so on. Very little if anything truly novel about the elements of Mr. Robot, at least as far as the first episode.As for the production - obviously on a tight budget but a gritty feel is developed with liberal use of grey city scenes and green fluorescent indoor lighting, without becoming too melancholic.The writers have thrown in several terms into the dialogue - ""rootkit"", ""DDOS"", etc. - that strike me as too obviously placed, as a blatant attempt to identify with the target audience. The dialogues are nowhere as strong as the monologue and are short, somewhat awkward.Even with all those weaknesses, the first episode left us wanting more. Worth catching.",positive
"I don't think I will have found another series like Mr. Robot. It is impossible anymore after such a strong scenerio, actings, cast, camera angles and successful scenes... Each scenes and each details has mean something. There is no doubt about this masterpiece has a big achievement.",positive
A masterpiece. I wish i could give this more than 10 stars,positive
"If you are open minded, and intelligent, then ""Mr. Robot"" is for you.",positive
"Utterly soulless cynical tripe dreamed up by middle aged hacks to spoon up to young people going through an awkward phase. As for the philosophy behind it, where to start? Money is evil, because, ooohh, old people are like totally greedy, and young people (without families and mortgages), just aren't materialistic. Companies are evil, because they want money, and they like steal things from people cos they're so rich, and, and, want to make money and stuff. Debt's evil, why should people have to pay back money they borrowed, surely ensuring that nobody has to take responsibility for their actions in living beyond their means will undoubtedly ensure paradise on Earth with no negative consequences? (This seems particularly true of student debt, in an obvious pitch to the core audience). It's all so childish and simplistic that you wonder if it's been written by a teenager, except of course, it's probably written by a middle aged man who doesn't believe any of it, but can remember being a teenage boy and knows how they think.Regarding characterisation: they're all awful. All old people (anyone over 25), are like totally stupid unless they're the rare example who totally gets the youth and understands that capitalism and stuff is bad and nobody should be responsible for anything except for businesses and governments, who are, like totally evil. All women need protecting from men, because of, like, sexism and stuff, and no women could stand up for themselves without a hipster man to protect them. The lead character's particularly vile; childish and self-obsessed, he treats everyone around him like dirt, and yet we're supposed to like him because of his adolescent understanding of politics. I think he's supposed to be autistic or something, but there's no real coherence, as he is simply a catalyst for events to happen, and alternates between supposedly being socially phobic and pushy and arrogant depending on what the writers require. There's some drug use which doesn't fit with the character either, and a lot of crude swearing and sexual references which seem inappropriate for what's basically teen fodder.The direction's boring too, clearly inspired by Christopher Nolan, it lacks his panache, and what's grungy looks drab, and what's meant to look coolly clinical, well, also looks drab. As mentioned, the script is like having an 18-year-old Sociology undergraduate shouting at you, and has, in true Guardian style, snarky sneering and a massive, and entirely unwarranted, sense of its own importance rather than real wit. The acting is rubbish, with the lead's supposed social awkwardness marking the fact he was chosen for his bug-eyed looks rather than talent. Particularly disappointing is Slater, he's the only established actor in it, yet just seems to be playing an older version of the same character he's played for about 30 years. I can't remember the music much, but I bet that's vile idiosyncratic look-at- me-aren't-I-clever hipster rubbish too.Basically, it's utterly dreadful bilge as cynically aimed at naive teenagers as any manufactured pop star. It really is like being stuck with some teenage brat with a ring through their nose whining 'It's, like sooooo unfair', and is getting good ratings as a result of that. Hey Millenials! This isn't against Evil Corp (supposedly ironic in the script, it was just embarrassing) it is Evil Corp! It's designed to appeal to the adolescent prejudices of your undeveloped minds to suck money out of you!I'd give this - 100,000 stars if I could. Worst programme ever.",negative
"This series is nothing but a mashup, a bad one, of Fight Club and V for Vendetta.Delusional hackers trying to bring down corporations. Making threatening videos, using masks, and claiming that they will free the world. What could be a 2 hours movie was extended to an endless ten episodes season.Besides that, what's is wrong with the cameraman and the directors? Why during every single dialogues do they put the characters on the very side of the screen facing out the TV? It's definitely NOT a nice style. It gives the impression that actors had to redo their lines alone on every scene and that there's no real interaction between them.After the first episodes you can't stop noticing it. Maybe they do that so you don't focus too much on the senseless dialogues.",negative
"I've already watched this show three times and it still blows me away. Sam Esmail is one of the best TV directors to this day and he really helps keep this show consistent in nearly every department. It somehow manages to implement so many genres in its final season whilst still being exciting, riveting, emotional and surprising.This show's score by Mac Quale is brilliant and the sound design is fantastic. It's editing is crisp and the acting is on point perfect from every actor. It's visually beautiful, completely unpredictable and near flawless. A True Masterpiece of TV.",negative
"Watching Mr Robot is this intense journey of emotions and confusion. But unlike other shows, the confusion you have doesn't make you want to drop the series and move on, it just grips you harder.
The final episode brings every answer you needed and more. And reveals things right at the end that elevate every other episode.
The finale was very well executed and only leaves you with one question, but it's a question Sam Esmail wanted you to imagine instead.
Which can sometimes be hard to achieve.
The plot twists are either completely unpredictable, or slightly predictable, but with details that still shock you.
It has charming characters that you'll sympathise with. Everything from common drives to mental complexity.
And none of this would have been delivered the way it was, without the actors.
Entrancing, award-worthy acting from the whole cast, every single one of them.
This show will always keep you on the edge of your seat begging for answers, and that's why I love it.",positive
"Masterpiece is what you've seen so far in review and same you'll say when you once watch it. Not only the story is epic! But the music and also direction by Sam Esmail, really big fan after this. Has unique direction. You've to keep your brain working or else you won't get what's going on.

Why is this guy 38 years old and I only heard of after bohemian rhapsody? His ability to convey the emotions of this character so poetically is mind boggling yet wonderful. He and the other actors kept me hooked through every season. I sincerely hope there is a series 5 and so on. Rami malek deserves more lead roles like this in the very near future,positive
"This show should be in the top of rating next to The sopranos, Breaking bad and GoT...I just I can't talk about this masterpiece
We've always used to see fake Hollywood's hackers, but this show showed us the real Hackers with no faking and with great acting from all the cast.
In 4 seasons Sam Esmail introduced to us a great writing, Directing and shocking plot twists specially in season 4, In every episode I was so exciting to the other oneand The great ending, Huh I just can't to talk
Go watch this great show and don't waste your time",positive
"I say it has no plot because the story hasn't progressed. I mean, from the beginning, to the season finale, the timeline of the story's progression is simply dull. I give this 5 stars out of 10 because of the potential it had but the story itself crumpled and just fell apart. There's nothing to this show. Everything that happened can be summarized into a sentence. Elliot, a schizophrenic, former drug addict, takes down the stock market with his unrealistic hacking skills.What else is there to the story? The writers and directors seemed to have ran around, and around throwing, great scenes with nice cinematography that may induce chills but forget that, that's not all what makes a good show. To be honest, you could literally watch the pilot episode and season finale and not have missed anything vital to the plot. This show is mediocre. But people want it to be greater than it actually is, but sorry, when you think about it, not everything is opinion. This show HAD potential. It was rushed, wasn't reviewed properly. I don't know, it isn't for me. Maybe for other high school students, but not me. (-- And that's it -- this could be on MTV, as I'm sure it's worthy of it and nothing more.)",negative
And I'm Re watching it AGAIN ! That's the end of my review lol I'm only writing more just to classify it as a longer review. But words can't explain how dope this show is ! Way ahead of its time,positive
I watched the first episode of Mr. Robot and then I had to watch it again. This is one of the first times that I wasn't sure where a show was going and I'm still not sure. The show is very gritty and strange with almost no good characters. The narration sometimes gets to be too much but is part of the draw of the show. I love seeing Christian Slater back on TV and Gloria Reuben back on TV. Rami Malek is interesting as is his character Elliot. I find that at the end of the episode I have more questions than answers so it will be fun to see where this goes and if they can keep up the suspense. Definitely not a show for people who don't want to think.,positive
"The writing on the wall is evident for this show early on, when Elliott ridicules someone for liking GEORGE W. BUSH'S DECISION POINTS and Josh Groban. Elliott is the main character in the story; he's no ""hero"" in my book. He has great hacking skills but somehow is ""trapped"" in his job and life. He even takes morphine, but he's oh-so-careful about it so he can rationalize that he's not an addict. He talks about heroes turning out to be phony, then we see people like Lance Armstrong and Bill Cosby. Why not include a picture of Obama in that group? Oh, right. It's because the show's creators probably love Obama!When Elliott's not busy stalking his psychiatrist's boy friend or sleeping with his morphine supplier, he comes across Mr. Robot and his fellow hackers. Mr. Robot had a father who rationalized stealing by saying that everyone steals, and – surprise – that people don't get their ""fair"" share in life (i.e. that most people get too little and a few get way too much). In this episode, he wants to hack into E corporation, which even Elliott calls ""Evil Corporation"" which is evil because...well, apparently because it's big. He wants to wipe out all their debt information so that he can accomplish ""the biggest redistribution of wealth ever."" (Well, at least he's upfront about it.) Never mind that people took on all that debt for some legitimate service. Apparently he feels the world would be better off if those consumers just got all their money back and the big evil corporation gets taken down a notch. Elliott is about to expose his organization to E Corporation, but changes his mind when their boss is rude to his incompetent co-worker. He changes his mind and frames the boss for the hacking scheme and debt destruction, raising his arms in triumph like Rocky when the innocent boss is arrested on bogus charges.Elliott is a disturbing, judgmental guy who frankly I couldn't care less about. The only nice thing I can say about him is that at the end it turns out he likes dogs. Considering the show's obvious Liberal bias, perhaps the biggest surprise about the pilot episode is that in the opening scene Elliott takes down a genuine dealer in child pornography and not, say, some decent, honest baker or photographer who simply doesn't want to participate in a gay ""wedding."" I wasted 45 minutes of my life watching this nonsense; I'm happy to say I won't be wasting another second on it.",negative
"I heard so many good things about this show, so I decided to give it a try. But now I'm in the middle of season 2 and I give up. Maybe this show gets better in season 3 like so many reviewers claim, but I'm not wasting another hour watching this painfully boring mess. I absolutely hate, hate, hate this dreary ""slow burn"" fad. Now bring on the downvotes.",negative

"It was really fun and exciting at the beginning when you thought it was about hackers taking down to the man, but once it went for the ""fight club"" twist and dudes mental health issues took over the plot lines it was a big let down. After awhile it just got boring and I know I'm in the minority here so go ahead and down vote this but the show is overrated. If your into main characters never knowing who they are or where they are with a technology theme then this is a show for you.",negative

Hands down one of the best shows I've ever seen. Elliot is portrayed and played perfectly by the great actor Rami Malek. I was initially intrigued then gradually became fascinated and then in TOTAL AWE!! of Elliot from the 3rd season onwards. Mind blown....I wish I could watch for the first time again you jammy b*****d 😂 👌🏻👌🏻,positive
"Writers should be sacked or at least taken off the Ritalin. I watched up to episode 3 of season 2. When Elliot start slagging off God and religion (how enlightened for the seventeenth century). I mean is there any other clichéd ""I'm so clever I read Voltaire"" BS you want to vomit on your audience?Stop trying to be clever, because you're not, and start entertaining, which you're not. If I want to hear pretentious ""know it alls"" spouting what they think they know then I can just venture down to my local wine bar or go on Google+ forums. If I want to be entertained with a good story then I watch a TV program. Remember who you are and forget what you think you know and get on with what your supposed to be doing: entertaining people, not alienating them with your opinions. I don't care what Elliot believes or thinks. I am not interested in his world view. I want a good conspiracy story-line, not a naval gazing session of his personal demons. It's boring and of no story telling value. He's a hacker and a nut case we all get that. Now move on with the story. Understand what you should be doing and start doing it or else you will loose your audience.",negative

"This show is brilliant, especially its S4. And I wanna say it's a big shame for Emmy academy for not giving even one nomination to this great show for S4.",positive
"I know a lot of folks gave up on this show in Season 2. I think they missed out. Like season 3 of the Wire it is definitely the weakest part of the show, but it is necessary.Push through it, the pay off is worth it.For me, the best movies and shows are the ones that hang around in your head for a while afterwards. This one hung around so much I started rewatching it again having only finished it a few weeks ago - I've never gone back and started a show again this quickly. Watching with the benefits of hindsight, it shows how well Sam Esmail set the story up to begin with.Season 4 ties things together beautifully, and episode 7 is one of the best episodes of TV I've seen in a decade or more (content warning - it's a very raw and exposed episode, and may make uncomfortable viewing for some).It also has the most satisfying ending to a show I have seen in a really long time, given how many times I have been disappointed with an ending to a show I was quite enjoying (Game of Thrones, Lost etc) it was a welcome change.Rami Malek is excellent as Elliot (that guy deserves to go far), Christian Slater (that was a surprise, hadn't seen him in forever) was great as Mr Robot and I was really impressed with Carly Chaikin (I had never seen her in anything else before).This humble reviewer absolutely loved the show. Hopefully you will too.",positive
"Formulaic and stilted. I was told I'd be ""hooked"" after the first episode. Nope. As much as I like Christian Slater, he stinks up the screen in this and is painful to watch. Although I can see the greatness in Malek's acting, this plot line has been done and redone so many times before. ""Hackers"" 1995, anyone?As I try to sit through an entire episode, all I can think of is how a bunch of execs hung out in board room somewhere in Hollywood and said, ""Gee. Let's make an updated hacker series for TV. Let's get some loner guy who talks to himself and feels a grand disconnect with his fellow man. Let's get some mostly handsome actor with googly eyes and a cool voice to be the hacker."" Z-z-z-z-z-z. This should be trashed right along with all those cancer stick butts the actors keep flicking onto the sidewalk.",negative
"I watched the episodes as they aired, but I found myself confused and lost in the plot.
I recenty decided to binge from the beginning and now I get it. Every element of this show is special. Even with its accolades, the general public is unaware of how brilliant the story is and how flawless it's been executed. It is stunning.",positive
"This review is based only on the first three episodes. I couldn't bear to watch the show any longer, sorry.So, where should I start? Perhaps clarifying that I loved the first episode would be a fine beginning. Because, well, I did. Why? Remove Elliot's tech/hacking talk and you see a man whose views on the world and its problems are staggeringly close to mine. The show itself looked like the most realistic piece of fiction I'd ever seen on mainstream TV. The writing felt real, the characters felt real, and the acting was excellent...That all went away with the second episode, and the third one made things even worse. OK, I get it, Fsociety is based on Anonymous, and Anonymous themselves praised the show to high heaven. But... So what? The way hacking is presented shows clearly that the writers did their homework on the subject matter. But... So what?? The acting is still excellent... But... So what??? Does that make the show feel real? No. Not anymore. With the second and especially with the third episode some glaring problems with the writing become evident - it just lacks subtlety, and it needs some desperately. OK, I get it - you want me to hate your bad guy, that is why you didn't give him any redeeming qualities. But did you have to make him a total pervert on top of that? You want me to hate another bad guy so, again, you make him a complete piece of sh... But did you have to make him a rapist on top of that? Etc. Every single character in this show is described like that. Their characteristics are forced down the viewer's throat and nothing is left to the imagination. If the writers want you to believe somebody is a bad guy, he or she will be simply the worst piece of cr@p you can imagine. If they want you to believe that somebody is stupid, he or she will be dumber than a brick. If they want you to believe somebody is cool, he or she will be the epitome of coolness itself. You get the point - as I said, the characterization lacks subtlety. It's overly simplistic. Frankly, if this show weren't so pretentious, that wouldn't be a problem, but it tries to look real... Well, sorry, but in reality nobody is pure evil, nobody is dumber than a brick, nobody is cooler than an 80s action hero... In reality things are not black and white.Sorry. I'm glad that people are enjoying this show. But I can't take it anymore. Still, the pilot episode was incredible.",negative
"First of all - I am no billionaire and still no millionaire. Why I have to state this in a movie review!? Simply because I find it almost satirical that a billion dollar business like the Hollywood dream machine is nowadays filled with movies that criticize, well billion dollar industries and capitalism and what-else - the new socialist, the new Marxist or socialist living in a villa driving big cars and complaining about an unjust world... Am I the only one who sees the irony, the great satirical potential in this - a billion dollar business complaining always about business!?Anyway, Mr. Robot got all the typical p.c.-stuff, and imo Mr. Robot could have been (with reducing the propaganda) a good movie, but there is not enough story and characters etc. for a lasting TV-show. This show is in season 3 and long gone stale. Season 1 I would rate 6, Season 2 was much weaker, Season 3 I'm out.Last question: Wonder I do, if I dare to take your prayers serious, what kind of sinister plan you, Hollywood, have in store for us, as you are part of the big scale global business!? ;)",negative

"I forced myself to watch the first 2 episodes and I wished I hadn't. There is really nothing to like about this TV show. It has no substance whatsoever. Un-interesting characters, un-realistic dialogs and situations.If you are some far left teenager who's living in your mom's basement and believe in the backward mentality that corporations are the source of all evil in the world, and that it's cool to ""take down the system"" using cyber terror attacks, maybe you can find something to like about this show, otherwise I would suggest to steer away from this. Ironically is sponsored by Amazon, one of the most consumer friendly corporations in the world. To add insult to injury it's filled with IT gibberish that is far beyond the average viewer knowledge on computers and it's just there to trick the viewer that this is somehow an intelligent show. How deceptive. Some technical terms here and there are fine but not like this in the driving seat. This show tries to be smart but it's dumb, tries to be modern but it's outdated. A failure on all fronts. Watch at your own peril, you will regret doing it.",negative
"I've been working in IT for 20+ years so I think I know a bit (just a bit) about that world.

"The writing on this show is so bad it makes me laugh. If you are an Occupy Dolt Street goon, I'm sure it will play right into your ""Freedom is the enemy"" meme. Seriously, the name of the antagonist company is Evil Corp. That's not its nickname, that's the real name of the evil corporation where the evil white CEO beats up homeless people for his stress relief en lieu of a hand held smooshy face thing where the eyes bug out, I suppose. The author obviously feels logic is for chumps, and has his protagonists violating the very rules they condemn others for. The Characters are cliché and ""dirtied up"" for what passes for badass now in entertainment, and as usually happens in Hollywood, the wrong people are tagged as the bad guys, while the real bad guys are proposed as the solution. Some of the acting is decent, especially the lead, the tech specs are nice, but the foundation of the show, the story and the characters, are built on quicksand. Seriously, moral depravity and socio economic opinions aside, this show is filmed for adults, but written for junior high schoolers.",negative
"It couldn't have a better ending, even though we might have expected a much more extensive closure, the way it ended was beautiful, In 4 Seasons you get everything you would expect for a Masterpiece, it's sad not being able to watch more but you end up more than satisfied with this journey, this really brings to public what the lives of a most computer enthusiastics out there and what is posible to be happening in real life without us even knowing, people with a secondary life, secrets so well hidden, worldwide evil corporations, everything is so well explained that you definitely begin to think about yourself and your data, if you're doing enough to protect your files and your life. Acting from Rami Malek is superb, it's really going to take a while for him to take off the Elliot mask, Darlene, Dom, Angela, Price, Whiterose, the series is filled with characters excellently made. If you like Drama/Action/Love/psychological thrillers series, this is perfect for you, you won't regret it, this is a must watch series..",positive
"TV has been on a hot streak over the past 5-10 years. The rise of cable and internet streaming are giving writers the freedom like never before to write shows that are thoughtful, challenging, and creative. In fact, almost 90% of the good shows anymore are on either cable or Netflix/Hulu/Amazon. Broadcast still gets the occasional gem like Modern Family or Last Man on Earth, but otherwise, most of the good stuff is cable/internet. I read about Mr. Robot and how good of a show it was by critics and viewers. I was ready to see something groundbreaking, somethng that would force me to binge watch. After three episodes, I stopped, and here's why.The show is nothing more than a rip off of Fight Club, The Matrix, and American Psycho thrown into a blender. Heck, every time Elliot narrates, I'm waiting for him to say ""I'm Jack's this or that."" It just felt free much ""been there, done that"" very early on, and watching the other episodes, it just seemed to continue down that road. Elliot is the typical anti-hero of this type of program: hates corporations, hates consumerism, hates ""normal"" life, has social anxiety and depression, has cute female friend he wants to date but is too shy to tell her and she dates losers, hates the media, thinks society is fake and screwed up, etc. He lives by himself in New York City, working as Tech Support for a security company by day and as a hacker vigilante at night, where he blackmails victims not for money, but instead to be honest to their family, friends, etc. about their vices and as a result, be better human beings. One day, on a train, he meets Mr. Robot, Christian Slater doing his best Tyler Durden, who invites him to join an underground team who's mission is to take down a corporation that looks strangely like Enron, one of those big ""evil"" corporations. Kind of like Project Mayhem...Sound familiar? That's the problem. This story has been told before in other media. Sure, it's been 15-20 years, but there was nothing in this show that got me glued and interested. All it did was remind me of parts of Fight Club, Matrix and American Psycho. I mean, the show even goes on the whole ""Is Mr. Robot real or a fragment of his imagination?"" just like Fight Club. We get it, society sucks and life is unfair. Yawn. Negative outlooks only bread negative results. Believe it or not, you can work hard and have a good life. Not everything is horrible.If you want to see this tale told better, rent Fight Club, Matrix and American Psycho.",negative
"I have not had such pleasure in any series. Masterpiece Masterpiece Masterpiece.From the first season I saw, I went crazy with this series
I do not know what to define ... story, actors, directing ...
The whole series was fantastic.",positive
"NO SPOILERS
I'd risk saying that it's even better than Breaking Bad.
Under the techy and political nature of the story, it's a very heavy, emotional and spiritual journey aswell.
At times it felt a little drawn out for me, but it's worth watching 'till the end.The story and setting is very bold, reminds me of The Matrix a little bit, with less grandiosity. The focus however, is on the personalities and the individuals in this one. The story pieces can be very clever and exciting. When the pacing is right too, which it usually is, you can get really drawn away by it. Almost like in an action movie, it's pretty interesting stuff.
It has a good mix of fantasy and reality, humour and drama.The production is all right, it achieves what it wants. It's not as exciting visually as Breaking Bad can be sometimes, but I don't have anything bad to say about the camerawork. It's just non intrusive.
There are some interesting songs and ambient tracks, but the dialogues are the main focus. I think the actors did a great job with their voices.
In terms of acting? I didn't really pay attention honestly, It didn't feel bad anytime, I was never taken out of the moment by bad acting. So I guess that's alright too.Judging by what I have written so far, it may seem like it's a pretty average show.
But don't be so judgemental ;)This show is very introspective, very subtle. Something you should experience for yourself.
For me, in the end, it became something very beutiful, despite how dreadful and desperate the plot felt. I guess I could say that it moved me. Big respect for everyone who worked on this.
Highly recommended!",positive
"This delivers. Nearly every episode is its own kind of art, especially in S4. For example, there is an episode with not a single cut visible, with outstanding cinematography at the same time, thrills like hell, and an other with only 2 lines spoken, 1 at the beginning and another at the end. And first i don't got it: its hard to think about the production and the way it was made, while you're inside the episode that hard. Outstanding acting, great soundtracks and a deep plot, which i've never seen, or felt before, does the rest.
Then this show delivers 2 endings. One action-blasted which could stand alone, and 4 episodes later one emotional ending, mind-blowing and really satisfying.
I will see the whole thing a second time, maybe then i'll be able to see the whole thing :)",positive
"There are just a few series in the last years that I have seen which have blown me away like Fringe, Game of Thrones and this series here Mr. Robot. I couldn't stop watching it, I always wanted to know what happens next. This series is very emotional which I didn't expect and every character is very well developped and very unique, you really feel for the characters in this show. Just great, I would love to see a movie about it one day.",positive
"I am an engineer by trade. An a lot of the hacker movies that project these geeky kids, and following a wire, are patently false and not even close to reality.This movie however breaks that mold. The realism of the computer hacking aspect and the paranoia that the main character feels, makes its a thrilling combination.Plot: I must admit i have often thought that the rich become richer, and the middle class eroding. Capitalism and democracy wasn't set up for corporations to take over, but for people to live in equality. But with big money and lobbying, and super packs, money decides politics not people. So this show hits important points to society today.",positive
"Great acting and a exeptional show, everytime you think you've figured out what's going on it changes. The last episode was fantastic.",positive
"Just wow. Mr. Robot is brilliant. Every season is amazing, but season 4 is one of the best things that ever happened in the TV. Definitely the best show since Breaking Bad. Deserves more recognition.",positive
"A show that succeeds in almost every area. Editing, Acting, Writing, pacing, directing, themes, social commentary and emotion are all perfect.Although I found the ending to be disappointing as a whole the show is so incredible that its a truly unpredictable and unforgettable experience.",positive
"The vast majority of people aren't going to fully understand the intricacies of this show but it won't matter, it's still a magnificent bit of TV. Not to be missed",positive
It helps the story line if you have a rudimentary understanding of programing but it's not necessary. The story telling rises above all the geek trivia and leaves you surprised and sometimes cheering at the TV screen.,positive
"When I first start viewing this show I say: ""Holy crap""! The emotional and psychological complexity of Elliot is amazing and Rami Malek is superb in the evolve of the character. Not to many times we are able to find a principal character with too many dark and suicidal thoughts and in some way you feel connected to Elliot Alderson. The first season is a beautiful masterpiece, but the second season, oh my, probably one of the worst I see in a long time. To have an idea, when the first season was finalized this show have a rating of 9.3 in IMDb, now 8.7 and continue to drop in a dramatically way. I just hope the producers, writers and directors find a way to rescue this show that look so promising in the first season. Hope isn't too late for that. I encourage to people to see this show, even with that bad 2nd season, just for the superb character that Elliot Alderson is.",positive
"While the story line and acting and... is pretty much as good as it used to be the plot and envirment thereally ""world"" and everything that happens feels boring predictable and underwhelimngthe series is dark but not in a good way dark and full of contrast in a way that
makes it feel dull
and poor... 1 of thoes things where everything seems right from a checklist prespective and on paper but simply irl dosen't cut itit might just be me it might be a taste issue... but somthing feels wrong missing/boring..
i can't put my finger on it but it's simply slow and feels pointlesslike the writers diden't plan to go pass 2 seasons... only it's not it....
somthing feels off
maybe their trying to hard but...
idk the series gets boring and pointless emotionaly disentached over time..
the plot gets more and more predictable the lightig and camera work gets... ""uhhh""everything feels like all the cast and the writers simply want to get over with this thing cash out and no one cares how good the dialog is for example...the pointless dull scenes full with boring ""dramatic"" robotic standing in place
in short the best way to describe it might simply be... empty...
don't get me wrong the series is great over all.... the first 2 seasons..
but season 3 slowly got more and more predictable and boring and it was a pain to end (i nearlly skipped the last 2 episods but watched them to give my review..)
and now starting season 4 while for the moment i only watched the first episod it feels the same...
simply boring
pointless scense of that robotic standing in place talking about somthing ""important""/ dramaticit's simply bad...i do suggest you watch the first seasons and over time u might get as sick of it as me and you'll see how the series change into a empty shell of what it was....but still i do suggest u watch it",negative

"It's all about the awareness of a disturbing notion that induces a malaise on someone from which one is distracted by it's very cause. Trying to change the world for the better may help coping with it as it is implemented by our protagonist in this promising pilot. Nevertheless there won't be any curing in sight for him since bothering with trivial circumstances of the 'real world' we live in is just an induced deflection from the real Mama: our own very existence. Life is short and vulnerable and the moment you pay too much attention to this notion, you'll end up like Mr. Robot. Cheer up, it's just a movie. Last but not least standing ovation to the Director Niels Arden Oplev and Writer Sam Esmail, not to mention the intriguingly interpretation of the lead character by Rami Malek. I was always hoping for a real world adoption of The Matrix- so don't mess it up people!",positive
"I watched this series with great interest initially. It started off in episodes 1 and 2 with a good storyline, good acting and an interesting subject.However, once episode 3 and beyond hit it's a different matter. The thinly veiled propaganda is hidden behind a storyline of drug abuse of the main character and various 'dream' sequences.Out went the intelligent dialogue and in came a motive. Not of the characters but a motive of the writers and directors. It's to sell their view of the world and the 'evils of capitalism'.I may not agree with everything capitalism does but I don't need a political doctrine force fed to me hiding within a series which has lost its edge.oh, sorry, I forgot... it's all because he is tripping.",negative
"Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) is a peculiar cyber security computer programmer working at Allsafe. He works with his best friend Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday). Their client ECorp is seen as Evil Corp. Elliot is recruited by Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) into fsociety, hackers who are out to bring down ECorp and the new world order. Darlene (Carly Chaikin) is one of the fsociety hackers. Mr. Robot is actually his father and Darlene is his sister. His world is one of delusions and unknown history. In the first season, he buys drugs from neighbor Shayla Nico to deal with his affliction. In the second season, FBI agent Dom DiPierro (Grace Gummer) investigates the ECorp hack.The first season is noteworthy television. The delusions and the real world blend into an intoxicating mix. My favorite character may be Shayla and it's too bad that she dies. That is the way of new television. Somewhere in the second season, the show needed to switch into a real world point of view. The unreliable narrator is compelling for a little while but at some point, the audience needs more solid footing. In essence, anything can be unreal and nothing has stability. This is a show where it could end with an autistic child's snow-globe and nobody would blink. It needs stakes and it has no stakes if nothing is declared real. The show missed the exit ramp and goes off into the infinite emptiness. Each subsequent season descend further into confused unreality. A notable later addition is BD Wong who creates a terrific original character. I may prefer the snow-globe ending. At least, that would be batship crazy.",positive
"I doubt there will be another show that gets me as much as this show. I will not spoil this show, however anyone who understands the world we live in today will appreciate the genius behind this show. Sam Esmail you stole my heart.",positive
"After watching season 4, I can confidently say that this is the greatest television series of all time. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty well done, and entertaining, but the pace really picks up with season 3 and season 4 is just amazing. Honestly, 407 and 413 just blow my mind, the reveals in both those episodes were perfect and emotional. And, now starting to rewatch it, I see a brilliant amount of foreshadowing that makes it clear Sam Esmail knew where this was going from the beginning.",positive
"Mr. Robot is an very well made series. The directing is solid, and the soundscape really adds to the tension in the story. ""eps1.7_wh1ter0se.m4v"" is my favorite episode of the series: it's mind bending and just flat out thrilling. That episode reminds me of BBC's Sherlock: playing mind games throughout the entire episode. Mr. Robot has been doing that since episode 1, and not being sure what is real and what is not is what makes that episode awesome (9/10)Some of the episodes, like the pilot, are a little overrated, but still very good. I was let down by the final two episodes, after the huge build up from Brave Traveler through Whiterose. Overall, Mr. Robot is an awesome series that I will make sure to keep on watching.8/10",positive

Where should I put Mr. Robot now in my top list? It's on the top with these beloved gems, all sharing the no. 1:
Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, Wire, Fringe, Lost",positive
"Mr Robot is a show that cannot be compared. It does not lack creativity, or quality, in any single aspect of the show. From its unique cinematography, to the wonderfully odd music choices, it all just screams a level of care in the show that I find lack in almost all mediaWhile on the surface it seems that this show is all about making a TV-show about realistic hacking, it quickly evolves into a very complex show, with heavy themes often regarding family, mental health and abuse, as well as questioning what right and wrong isThe show has a way of making the viewer feel emotions that I haven't really seen utilized in other shows or films.
What they often do is pick a song for a scene, let the actors simply speak 2-3 lines, and then just let the shot linger as the actors watch eachothers, in a kuleshov effect fashion. While this is a very simple idea, the show does this to great effect.As a show, it is divided into 3 parts. Season 1 deals with hacking the largest corporation of all time, whilst exploring Elliot as a character with his mental issues.
Then comes Season 2-3, which explores the effect this hack had on society, as well as developing the complex relationship that Elliot has with the dead persona of his father
Finally we have season 4, which despite the overwhelming pessimistic feels in the previous seasons, manages to turn itself into a positive message about oneself, without feeling forced or preachy. It resolves every important question that existed from the previous seasons, and proves how Sam Esmail knew where the show was going from the very startThe ending to Mr Robot is both very open to discussion, whilst somehow still providing satisfying answers. Never before have I seen such a complex show that could so wonderfully be compiled into 2-3 central concepts. What is more amazing is that the show does this without making the central themes obvious until it is over and the show has fully unwrapped itself.Overall, to describe the show is very difficult as it often evokes unique emotions. It is a show better experienced than read aboutI believe Mr Robot will go down in history as one of the greatest shows of all time, and as my personal favourite. It currently is criminally unknown, relative to its quality, but I have no doubt that within a few years the show will get the cult status that it deserves.",positive
"I enjoy Mr. Robot although I do find it somewhat overly violent ,it uses fresh innovative ideas and you are always surprised by something which happens in every episode. However what I Like the very best best About the show is that in almost every scene in every corporate office or every home there are some wonderful abstract paintings . I would really like to know who all these works are painted by . If only I could get my hands on a list of the artists !",positive
"A lot of people still think of the internet and hacking culture as some kind of mysterious and fascinating revolution. If you aspire to join the ranks of snooty faux geek wannabes then this show is for you. I tried to watch it twice. I thought maybe episode two would be less insulting? Please.I was shocked, SHOCKED I tell you, when it was mentioned that the onion routing protocol was not as secure as previously thought. That means all the illegal onions I purchased on the ""Dark Web"" are now open to interrogation by the National Security Administration, and that just plain scares me.It's time to change my Yahoo password and stop uploading my address book to social networking services. I am so frightened of what this show has made me aware of that I can barely sleep at night. I can't believe people are entertained by this scriptwriting drivel and ridiculous acting.",negative
"Mr Robot offers what appears to be a subversive take on society and culture. The reality is somewhat more orthodox, with a message that's anything but revolutionary. In spite of its pretensions Mr Robot is another formulaic drama that tows the mainstream line from the very opening scenes. This makes sense if you consider the fact that this series is not crowd sourced or the work of an artistic collective but instead a large corporation. Hang on, but isn't this corporate counter culture? Exactly... Some people will be fooled by a few of the honest hooks cast on the water, but the fact is the key character is typecast as a controlling, stalking, social misfit with mental health issues and an illicit drug problem.The reality of many real subversives, is nothing like this. They are simply normal people outraged by what they see big business doing to people and the planet. If you want a real take on counter culture and social subversion take a look at ""If a Tree Falls"" by Oscilloscope or any number of other docos about groups like Anonymous. If, on the other hand, you are comfortable with an admittedly well written work of fiction, that reinforces social and political stereotypes, this will do. Five out of ten from me.",negative
"For anyone with doubts about whether they want to watch the show or not, do yourself a favor and watch the Pilot, you wont be disappointed. The show is about much more than hackers and computers, and takes us into a world must of us never see, the place where the 1% cool their heels. ""Rami Malek"" (Elliot) makes a believer of us within the 1st 5 minutes of the pilot and keeps us glued to the set for the next hour. In some ways his choices mirror the choices of people in todays society. My only criticism would be ""Christian Slater"" as Mr. Robot, while I like him as an actor, he just doesn't fit in the role of Mr. Robot. There are so many better suited actors that could have elevated the role. You really need a ""Gabriel"" (John Travolta) type character from Swordfish to complete the show.",positive
"I really wanted to enjoy this show. The concept was intriguing.But after finishing off this last season, I do not care for a new season.Take away all of the distracting effects, the blurring, the blinking, the flashing, the fat transitions, and you have very little left except a slight story of Snowden and a lot of sex scenes that try to push the extremes of what most people are comfortable with. Typical Hollywood junk, in the end. It is another show written by very immature ""kids"" who think they are smarter than thou, and who think pushing their own memes and propaganda on you is ""cool."" Why create a really good story when you can feed think propaganda to the masses? The worst president in history shown in good light (obama) versus (bad) Trump and how many times did they use the word ""teabagger?"" Just for the sake of using it. Delusional.Yes, all we need is another show glorifying Obama. Pictures of him everywhere, clips and other dumb stuff. Who cares. Oh, and don't forget, Corporations are evil. Yeah, same old leftie crap.No story in the end. Hacking. Yeah, that it's it. A hacker who is mental.",negative
"An amazing pure art created by esmail and perfectly portrayed by Rami malek...
If you don't like this you better go watch Supergirl, flash, friends Cz this show is beyond your believe",positive
"Has many holes, its silly at times, but... it is well put together.Rami Malek is very good in the main role. He carries the show, really.The writing is acceptable on the computing technical side, something very unusual.On the subject of ""world financial evil corporations"" and other clumsy generalizations passing as social commentary, it is just dribble, a random collection of inane, vacuous, and puerile rants. It bores.The pilot promises a great deal and I will watch a second episode. The hope is that the series does not degenerate into another soap opera as most TV shows do (who sleeps with who, who ""disappoints"" who, etc).This show presents a rare opportunity for those of us that have given up on television. I'm going to rate it provisionally with 6 stars.",negative
The theme of this movie is great. The actors are very well immersed in their own plan.,positive
"I have few words... fantastic story, unique production, top acting, everything with Mr. Robot was well done and entertaining! One of few must-sees in its class.",positive
"Mr Robot is a psychological drama depicting the life of Elliott Anderson, a schizophrenic computer genius who manipulates the world to his pleasing through electronics. Mr Robot is filled with action, emotion, and monologues equaling those of Rorshach from Watchmen. Perfectly rewatchable, emotionally investing and jaw dropping twists.",positive
"""Mr. Robot"" is far from being the perfect TV show, but it deserves praise for how it always tries to do something different. Like ""Lost"", some crazy solutions worked, some didn't, but I still dare you to find another series that is as personal and innovative in the last decade.The plot is convoluted and all over the place, often with too convenient plot contrivances, pointless deviations, and easy ways out in the most desperate situations. However, the story has only relative importance as, after all, it's just an excuse to make a pitch-black cynical social commentary on our generation's social anxieties, chronic isolation, and insecurities. Everything we see is filtered through the alienated mind of an unreliable narrator who is nothing but the product of our fucked up society. The subjective perspective of the show is tastefully portrayed by uncomfortably odd camera framing and glitchy editing that always go along with Elliot's feelings.The first season seems even too over-stylized and naive in its social commentary to be actually taken seriously, but as the show progresses, we realize that we should keep questioning whatever happens, that Elliot is as delusional and self-contradictory as the other characters. At some point we are not even sure if we are actually with the good guys, if the revolution is actually making any sense. The second season is a little too slow and sometimes even displeasing in how it tries to be artsy at all costs, but it manages to set the right tone for the definitely more mature and possibly even more cynical third and fourth season. I was not always satisfied with the abrupt ways most of the characters' arcs have been closed, but Elliot's inner journey has been dealt with almost perfectly.",positive
"I loved the first episode which showed an awkward geek take down an internet pedophile. Yes, Elliot was weird but likable at first. Then we find out he is a drug addicted, nut job! I won't go into the story details as this has been thrashed to death but I will say there are so many holes that become annoying! In season 1, Elliot is forced to break a prisoner out of jail which he does by hacking the jail and opening all of the prison doors. I am not familiar with jails but you would think there would be prison guards somewhere in the jail but in this jail there doesn't seem to be any! Plus, it takes the prisoners less than a minute to manoeuvre through the jail to the fence where the gate is simple to open! THEN the prisoner Elliot was aiming the breakout to free, hangs around for quite some time JUST OUTSIDE of the prison and shoots a dude while talking to Elliot! Mr ROBOT is Elliot's dead father and companion who it seems, EVERYONE can talk to! This is one of those shows where you never know who is real or not and would not be surprised if at the end, Elliot has been in a NUT HOUSE THE ENTIRE TIME! Honestly, with all of the stupid scenarios including a very fast drug withdrawal dry out session, which was overnight, the only people who would find this show great, are those who pretend to know what's going on! Oh, and I love the so called 'geeks' who watch this show and dream of being a hacker. I suppose they can relate to Elliot's mental illness! BTW, Elliot is depressed as he is 'lonely' and yet he seems to be popular and has many friends! For someone whose life is computers, he doesn't seem to spend much time on them!",negative
I can't believe the series that really good like this exist. I love the amount of detail that shown in it. The storyline is so good that I feel so sad when it ends. The ending is so perfect. The cinematography is also so good. Good job to everyone that working on this series to make it happen!,positive
"Watch it. Then re watch it knowing what you know. It's an entirely different series when you know. Trust me, this makes sense. You'll see.",positive
"I started watching this show after hearing my friends raving about it. I will say that the premise itself is very exciting, and the show certainly does have its moments.What i like: I like it when the plot moves along and one of the characters gets on a terminal and hacks some stuff. I like some of the action sequences that make you feel like you're in a spy movie.What i don't like: Two seasons in and Elliot is still completely psychotic. I'm really annoyed by the whole mental illness aspect of this show because it has slowed the plot down to a crawl. I'm so sick of Elliot losing his mind and having no idea what is going on. They really need to fix this in season 3. Also, there is virtually no character development on this entire show. Maybe the only exception to this is Angela's character, but it's not really clear what her game is or what her motivations are. Elliot's imaginary father is just a terrible character. Im sure the actor playing him is doing the best he can, but literally all he does is argue with Elliot and literally you could copy and paste any scene whenever the two of them are together and it would make no difference to the plot. Also, Tyrell Wellick was the best character on the show and they made him disappear for the bulk of season 2.",positive
"I'm gonna try and make this as short as possible, remember the hideous got finale? This is the complete opposite of it.",positive
I don't know any other series in my life that could have started perfectly and ended perfectly. This series I'm sure will remain my favorite for the rest of my life! sorry for my not perfect English but I couldn't help but write a review,positive
"I remember the first time i heared about Mr robot , it had only 2 or 3 episodes out and as a ""not so big of a fan"" of Rami Malek and pretty boring Summery of the plot i decided to let it go .And boy was i wrong , i don't recall how i've decided to watch the first episode but i sure can recall how it got me hooked up from the first couple of minutes through the episode. Megical thing i've discovered about this show is that you don't need to fully understand what is going on , it somehow gets you hooked up ,maybe because this show shows us something that can happen in real life? i don't know but i watched almost the whole first season in a heart beat. Sure there are sometimes when it gets a little boring but the showmakers seem to know what they are doing and it works perfectly . I strongly recommend it to everyone , the acting is A+ and the plot is awesome , i hope they will keep it on the same level when the 3rd season comes out , oh well im sure they will.",positive
"I've not watched many series to completion as I tend to get bored easily. My top 3 list is small with Breaking Bad, GOT and Startup (still active). However Mr Robot is now my top favourite. This show is on another level/dimension with regards to screen writing, acting and cinematography. This final season was top notch jaw dropping. Sam Esmail is a genius.It's a shame this show has not got the global recognition it deserves. I go to work wanting to talk about it and no one else is watching it.Mr Robot you are now at peace, but not forgotten. Hopefully you will get the future recognition you deserve. I highly recommend this to anyone reading this review. Binge watch this and you will be amazed.",positive
"This could (should) have been a really good movie, but they made a series instead.The first episode was great. By episode 4 or 5, meh. By the end of the first season, it does what most series do; forgets the original plot and turns into a soap opera.I would far rather watch a movie or a well written mini series like True Detective or Mind Hunters than something that should be a movie (or mini series) but for for financial reasons they keep grinding out episodes/seasons and ruin a good thing.",negative
"Thought provoking and emotional, best thing I've watched in terms of quality (writing and production) since Breaking Bad.",positive
"I usually never write reviews. This series deserves one. It is one of the most powerful series ever made. Blend of reality in it, truth and the power in this world.. Mr. Robot - amazingly done! Love it!",positive
"The initial setup was nice. The first 3-4 episodes - perfectly watchable. But by episode 7 it dawned on me that this show was going nowhere. The writing is pretentious and overexposed. Elliott's inner monologues are a frustrating mambo jumbo of some new age truisms. The characters - annoying. There isn't a single character in this show to identify with or feel for. It doesn't help that characters don't get any development. They simply come and go, and why they went and whether they're going to be back - I don't care.So episode 7 was the last episode for me. I'm guessing I'm within the primary target audience for this show, but the truth is - it just couldn't make me care enough. An opportunity squandered.",negative
In my opinion. This is how it should be done. Always. So much planning is has gone on behind the scenes and nothing is left waste. Nothing 'left for creativity' and every episode has something to offerThis showcases the director/writer's confidence in their project.This is a one in a lifetime show I think.,positive
"If you like character driven shows, this is it. Rami Malek does a fantastic job portraying Elliot. This show takes you through twists and turns. There's different (and equally interesting) storylines throughout the show. B. D. Wong is excellent; as is Joey Badass. This show, give it time. It's a slow burn the first episode or two, but then it's fantastic.",positive
"Just finished the finale and I have no words. This show is simply fantastic. Sam Esmail is a genius. The acting is near on perfection. Just stop reading this and watch the show. Masterpiece, thank you Mr Esmail.",positive
"I know many people who procrastinate thinking that this is a story about a socially awkward guy.. Just don't. This show is not to be missed out. The writing is great, the acting is great, the direction is great. What else do you need, a great story with great actors. The first 3 seasons are mind-blowing. The way they are written is fabulous. The final season is on some other level. After watching the first 3 seasons the show is recommendable, but after the final season it is a must see. There are a few shows that end as good as this.",positive
Best show on TV. Even considering Game of Thrones...,positive
This is the one of the world most best coolest hacking series her imagination is so cool .,positive
"I'd hoped for something...different, new or original. So what do we get? A ""hero"" who may be delusional whose biography is like a check card for Hollywood - loner, substance abuser, hoody wearer , gritty apartment in bad part of town, tech job, hates Bush, Facebook, Apple and corporations. I mean, how unoriginal can you get?Combine that with the most popular left and right-wing conspiracies (""they"" are secretly controlling us with debt and things, choice is an illusion, money is not real since we left the gold standard, business is evil, absolving debt is the answer, we are being tracked, etc) and you get the atmosphere. You never know if the scene you are watching is real or simply yet another delusion of our anarchist hero who bemoans loneliness as he walks the street at night or spies on random folks, Reminds me of Leverage that started great then became formulaic. My Grade - C",negative
"Mr. Robot pretty much screams out SERIOUS DRAMA. Set to a driving, minimalist score, the series followed a surprisingly odd-looking young man who suffers from paranoid delusions and is obsessed with the terribleness of the world. He's a computer security guy at work, and in off hours he hacks into people and smites those he feels are bad people.Then a guy named Mr. Robot comes along with a story about using his hacking skills to save the world.The show is very well filmed, with superior camera work and an intense performance by the lead. But it's also full of false notes. The lead's vigilantism is creepy, yet he is shown taking down such unequivocally bad people (child molester, guy who mistreats dogs) that it appears the series has little interest in creating a truly complex character. The rants against the world feel juvenile and superficial, yet the series seems to want us to take this guy seriously.Then there's Mr. Robot, played by Christian Slater. Now, I like Slater, but he doesn't seem to know what to do with his character. He fails to match the grim seriousness of the lead, his alias is silly, and he creates no sense of authority, mystery, edginess, or anything else that could further or run counter to the prevailing mood.There are actually a lot of interesting places this series could go. Mr. Robot could have all sorts of unknown plans, and this could all go someplace we would never expect. But the first episode doesn't really act like it has anything up its sleeve. If there's some cool stuff ahead, they certainly aren't telegraphing it.Maybe it will get good. It acts like a series that's planning to get good. But I ended the episode with no particular curiosity regarding what is to come next.",negative
I dont want to spoil too much so I will just say that the ending is worth watching this show.,positive
"Cast, locations, soundtrack and story are a beautiful thing.",positive
"I wouldn't normally write a review based on a pilot but this one really deserves attention and someone needs to question those low star comments. Firstly, this pilot episode has good photography, good acting - the lead actor is definitely one to look out for in the future, and a good plot that actually attempts to engage hacking properly - sure they have to cut a few corners for entertainment's sake - you can't spend days or weeks trying to crack a password in a TV drama but at least there are attempts at social engineering and awareness of terms. Now to address those low star comments... 1) Politics... this drama has a left wing agenda that is going to upset a few of those on the right. However, you shouldn't make a review that is clearly influenced by your politics and not what is on the screen2) This drama expects you to know some tech-speak... it is not overly complex but you should know things like DDOS attack, Tor, Onion encryption etc. At a guess expect more... ‎judging by the plot, Low Orbit Ion Cannon and rootkit are going to be dropped in there at some point in the future. Rather than attack the program for your own ignorance, perhaps make a note of some of the terms and look them up - thus educating yourself. 3) Christian Slater was probably chosen because of his earlier films like Pump up the Volume and Heathers... that really defined him as an actor, maybe less so for the TV comedy Breaking In.",positive
"After watching literally hundreds of tv shows, I've NEVER written a review...until now. Simply put, I was moved as I've rarely experienced before. The only show I've seen that had me slack jawed by the conclusion of season 4, and the only show where I've been so conflicted over the ending. Brilliant.",positive
"Slow, plodding, none of the characters are likable or someone you can relate to.It tries to hard to be clever, and as a result just waste time not developing the story or the characters. Tried several times to get into it and every time I gave up because nothing happens.The premise of the show was excellent, the execution poor, spends too much time focusing on mute points and not enough happens.Also found that the majority of good things seem to be taken from other shows, e.g. researching and setting people up ala Dexter or keeping hard disk copies of his work again ala Dexter.Not sure how this show can have 8.9 in ratings as its one of those that's so boring you start questioning why your wasting your life watching this!",negative
"Not many shows exist that make you reevaluate the world or ones self. For me , this show is one of those. I know this is a just a TV show where in the end of the day , its just meant to have more viewers for advertiser metrics for more revenue. But somehow this show managed to hit many societal points of controversy with great amounts of empathy in its delivery.Sam Esmail created a story that I didn't want to end. The show possibly sadistic by viewing Elliot in different situations of total pain and agony, it later transform into a show where I started empathizing with Elliot more and more. Great show but not for the faint of heart.",positive
"I am lost for words. One of the best shows ever made. Gripping, intelligent, unbelievable.",positive
"Finally surrendered to the hype and started watching S1. I found it interesting at first, and fun. Soon the plot, not believable in the first place, decided to up the ridiculousness and lead us down a rabbit hole of absurdity.Of all the performances, Malik was the best but his monotonous delivery went from interesting to 'I'm not watching anymore"". Nobody else was worthwhile, but what can you do with empty dialogue. Slater was his usual self.A good pilot melange of ripped ideas that never made it past the starting gate. I gave up towards the end of the season, as insult amounted to injury.",negative
"This show is one of (and may be THE) crown jewel of the new renessaince of television. Masterful writing, new and unique cinematography, emphasising the urban isolation everyone living in a big city can relate to. The plot - a hacker with social anxiety becomes a dark modern age superhero to battle the ultimate villain, corporations - is simply a framing device for the character study for so much unique characters. It could have failed spectacularly, if not played well, but is the casting phenomenal. Needless to sing the praise of Rami, he is the center, and the MVP throughout, but Slater, Wallström, Chaikin, Gummer, Cristofer are all phenomenal from the main cast. I never could get myself to like Angelas character, she was the weakest part of the writing (meaning her whole story- and character arc). The supporting/not main cast is spectacular: Bada$$, Cannavale, Villar, Robinson manage to capture the ""magic of the minor character"" characteristic for the Cohen brothers films.
Summary: Go check it out, definitely worth it!",positive
"Mr. Robot is a suspense drama about a brilliant young man named Elliot who is an expert with computers. Gradually we find out he has a 'passenger' in his life, another identity we come to know as Mr. Robot. The story is fantasy, including entities such as Evil Corp, FSociety and the Dark Army, yet they masterfully parallel things in real society such as unbridled capitalism, rebellious social activism, and sinister economic forces.The premise, design, and execution of this show is nothing short of brilliant. Each episode is a new delight of originality. Creator Sam Esmail delivers distinct characters, and an intriguing story line. I often watch the episodes more than once because there is so much going on artistically and in dialogue and story line. You will also love the soundtrack. The whole thing comes together perfectly.I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't yet seen this show, so SPOILER alert, I really hope the outcome for our lovable Elliot is that he is able to integrate his identities so he can have some peace in his life.Mr. Robot and Legion are ground breaking TV shows, in a class of their own, in my humble opinion.",positive
From the very first season this show turned out into what I not expected. From the second season each episode feels unique. Hats off to everyone behind this stupendous show. Wow !!!,positive
"Rami Malek. I haven't seen his other work, but I recognised the voice, from somewhere.In a state of stunned amazement I am, whenever the camera or microphone goes anywhere near him in this, and usually for some days after, just basking in the memories of it. Days pass and my anticipation of what he will do next, and /how/ he will do it, grows exponentially. No matter how slow or ponderous the shot, I just drink it in like some kind of acting nectar. It's amazing stuff! Try it! I've been gushing to all my friends about Mr. Robot, not normally my style. A performance that is almost a week later still frizzling deep trenches in my neural pathways, real memories. Dammit! I've got work to do, man! Family! Leave me alone! And holeebuzolee Christian Slater is in it! Who else possesses the insane charisma required to play Mr Robot himself, stomping on the old top of his game like some overused rag. Looks like Hollywood is granting wishes, at last! Thank you. Thank you!Every particle is in its perfect place, like some orchestral synergy of artistic and technical mastery; a magic show. I haven't been this exited about a second episode since long before I threw my own old-school TV out, many, many years ago. I am completely hook-line-and-sinker into this show.Waiting for a UK release isn't happening. Downloads are inevitable. Guys! Place a product in it, I'll buy it! Hardware, food, I'll try it! Just get this amazing show out to us!-fm",positive
"After watching the pilot I got really excited with Mr.Robot. It was very promising. I really liked the idea of the anarchist trying to mess up the financial world. Rami Malek seemed to be the perfect actor for that role. But the pilot might have been promising, the rest of the season went downwards very quickly. I don't know what the script writers were thinking but to me they are going completely the wrong way. And that's too bad because I really had big hopes for this show. The actors are not bad at all though, it's just the storyline that isn't good enough. They should more focus on the real hacking and anarchy then the mental issues of Elliot Alderson. That was a real bummer to me. I was going to give it a nine after the pilot but now after finishing the first season it only deserves maximum a five star rating. Hopefully they will do much better in the second season otherwise this series is going to die a slow death.",negative
"I went from knowing nothing about this show, to hearing little bits and then finally getting to a point where my interest was peaked enough to give it a go.The pilot was so awesome and got me hooked straight away, from the third episode onwards it gets kind of boring and repetitive until the seventh episode when things kicked right back into gear and the final three episodes returned to the awesomeness of the first episode.There is a twist and it's explained to the audience without making you look like an idiot and without pointing a giant neon sign .The cast is entertaining and made the boring parts somewhat more enjoyable to watch, Rami Malek and Christian Slater are most definitely the standouts of the show. It was about five or six episodes in until I realized that Carly Chaikin, who played Dalia Royce on Suburgatory, played Darlene.It does kind of make you think how much you put on the Internet, how easily accessible it is to anyone who knows how and just how much of everyday life can be ruined via the Internet. I also like how the episodes are titled after video files.I can see why the final episode was delayed due to the brutal killing of the reporter and her cameraman on live TV, it definitely would have hit a bit too close to home. There's sex, nudity, drugs, violence and just some pretty heavy scenes all through out this show.The season does end on a cliffhanger and there is an after credits scene on the final episode but I don't think that's enough to get me to watch season two.CHAPPY is still disappointed there were no actual robots!",negative
"Now that it's over, I am confident in giving it a 10.The most underrated show, I found this show because a friend kept raving about it...it really is a brilliant look at our vacuous society.Over the final 3 episodes I've had my mouth open the entire time. I don't know what to say, except watch this show.Season 4 - Wow! I've loved all 4 seasons of Mr Robot but 1 and 4 are definitely the best of the bunch.Season 4 has been an epic journey so far. I binged watch it.Rami Malek is truly brilliant and deserves the recognition he is getting; I feel that he is a very authentic actor. More from him please.",positive
A show about a mentally-ill hackerman. Ngl at the beginning it all seemed about hacking but turned dark pretty soon. Loved Rami's perfect potrayal of Elliot. Super cool plot too.,positive
"I totally loved this tv show, just when i think im caught up with everything, they come up with something unbelievable, its so annoying but I like how they never stopped to amaze me! And I really appreciate the talent of Rami Malek 🙌👏 10/10",positive
"It penetrates your mind and drags you slowly to that perfect, absolute closure.Nothing like this has been ever made before, that is for sure.Congratulations Sam Esmail!",positive
"Sometimes it's the best show on TV, sometimes it's total crap. Season 1 was great, but the writing has gotten weaker with each episode. The show pretty much it has the same premise as Fight Club, but with a slightly different twist. Bobby Cannavale was a nice addition to the show. His off beat twisted character is off the charts. I can't decide whether or not to continue watching the show or not.",negative
It's going to become one of those shows.With a great fan base.Loved everything about it from the beginning,positive
It's one of the best series ever!It has so many beautiful science so good at cinematic at all. It's not only this it has an excellent plot and a perfect psychological background.Main character as rami Malek is just awesome!,positive
"This was truly the most brilliant show I've ever watched. The cast, music, writing, and directing was so strong and executed perfectly. It was such a smart show and elicited emotional waves of confusion, joy, sadness, and love. Thank you!",positive
"The plot takes a back seat to the endless drama. Hacking? No. This show will now be about awkward relationships and drug use... They tried to do the Dexter monologue thing that worked so well in that show, but failed.The show had promise, but for some reason they swept that promise under the rug.",negative
"I found this show four years ago, and I've never been so addicted to TV ever. This show will change your perspective on the world we live in. 10/10 for the realist depiction of hacker culture. 10/10 for the mind-blowing twists, acting, writing, directing and just about everything.Please watch this illegally under rated masterpiece.This show is the reason Rami Malek is so big in the film industry. His acting throughout the show is unbelievable perfection.",positive
"This is a slow and boring TV show where the acting drags on and on and to be honest, Rami Malek is completely the wrong guy to be cast as the main character. He's not acting material and he is boring, has an irritating voice and appearance. The first episode could have been shown in 10 minutes and the show is really painful to watch. Very surprised it has a high rating but that's probably because dumb people like the idea of an ANONYMOUS type group trying to bring down corporate America. (for example - the mask used and how E Corp appears to be controlling everything). This series is riding on a wave and in time time, people will see this show for what it is - RUBBISH. At the moment, with all this Snowden, NSA and Assange thing in the news, people will be drawn to this but when you look at the episodes as a whole, absolutely nothing is being presented except boring bits of filming interleaved in boring bits of film where the writer thinks it's interesting to build up information about characters' lives. For example, when Mr Robot asks Elliot to tell him how his father died... I mean, who cares.....????",negative
"Mr Robot is a very CREATIVE, unique, emotional, mind blowing and shocking tv show that is filled with some plot twists that will blow your mind, I was personally so shocked of how amazing this tv show is.Season 1 of Mr Robot is one of its best seasons and it's rare to find a tv show that the first season of it is one of its best, Mr Robot even starts off with an amazing episode and that's episode 1 season 1, an incredible episode that I really enjoyed.Season 2 is its worst and it was really boring specially the first 4 or 5 episodes of the season. It will make you think the show is just ruined and the next seasons will be boring and the story will just be boring as well. Felt like the whole season wasn't even necessary but I would call season 2 that it was good compared to the other 3 seasons of the show that were excellent, that's why I said it's the show's worst season. There were a few episodes that saved season 2 and I enjoyed watching them.Season 3 and 4 were absolutely shocking and mind blowing, some episodes in these two seasons, I can talk about them for hours.eps3.4_runtime-err0r.r00 (Season 3 Episode 5) was an absolute masterpiece, the fact that it was a ""one shot"" is just amazing, you are there in every single thing that happens without cutting from a scene to the other, the camera never cuts. And it's a thing that I have seen in a very few movies but have never seen in any tv show. These things make Mr Robot a ""unique"" tv show.Mr robot can make you feel nervous, the whole episode without having any conversations or anything to say in the episode and yes I'm talking about the amazing episode called: 405 Method Not Allowed (Season 4 Episode 5) that doesn't have any single conversations in it except for 2 sentences maybe, one in the beginning and one at the very end.The final episode that I'll talk about is: 407 Proxy Authentication Required (Season 4 Episode 7), this episode itself is just a freakin ""MASTERPIECE"". An episode that has an amazing music score, an episode that has an amazing cinematography and colours that match with what Eliot is feeling. An episode that has an amazing cast: Rami Malek (Elliot Alderson), Christian Slater (Mr. Robot), Gloria Reuben (Krista Gordon) and Elliot Villar (Ferndando Vira). This episode isn't just the best episode that I have seen in Mr Robot or any tv show, it is one the best things that I have seen in my whole life. Hats off.Mr Robot's amazing cinematography is a thing that I have never seen in any other movie or tv show before, and if you have seen the show you'll know what I'm talking about. The music score was excellent and it builds up feelings inside of you, the customs were so cool, the black hoodie of Elliot, the shorts of Darlene, the $6,000 suit of Tyrell and the hat with the jacket of Mr Robot. The script and conversations were so deep and genius. And finally the cast of Mr Robot, I really don't know what to say about this part because all of them are literally amazing and I can't talk about all of them or I'll spoil a lot of stuff, I'll just talk about Rami Malek, he gave us a performance that's one of the best, his acting was so very deep, he acts with his face, eyes and everything, it was just shocking.There are a few stuff that I really wanted an answer to and that's the thing that made me want to watch a little more of Mr Robot and I'm talking about an episode or maybe 15 more minutes or something, unfortunately I can't say what they are because i don't want to spoil anything but for those who watched Mr Robot will defiantly get me. The ending of Mr Robot is very emotional, I really expected something else though, something bigger specially that the show had a lot of plot twists that were shocking but I wouldn't call the ending a very bad one I would just say that I expected more.Mr Robot is a masterpiece and for sure one of the best tv shows that ever exists. Great job to every single one who worked on it and to Sam Esmail, THANK YOU SO MUCH.my rating is: 9.6/10",positive
"Started out interesting and strong, then decays as each episode becomes more and more of a chore to watch. The show wanders and becomes more impractical over time as they stretch out the narrative. Season one had a good story line and presentation. Season two literally was a bore and the rest of the show just drags on in repetition. Was disappointed to say the least.",negative
One of the best shows I've ever seen. Mindblowing and espectacular. Is a must. 10/10 just for that great ending. Don't forget the soundtrack!,positive
"Greatest tv show ever
Sam esmail a genius
Rami is one of the best actors in the modern day
If season 5 of breaking bad had my basketball skills then season 4 of mr robot has mj basketball skills when it was 1992.Hello Elliots last 7 minutes is the greatest thing ever. I'd take this over anything on this app amd I think I'd pretty much be able to back it up.",positive

"Show had some problems from the first series, but they've gotten worse as it's progressed. Now, in series 3, it seems to be only short vignettes featuring characters from the current series and from past series doing inane things. I suppose the next one we'll see is the fake dad character goes to McDonalds, but the fry cook is one of the old hackers from series 1, then the fry cook gets his hand CAUGHT IN THE FRYER!!, and then the FBI agents arrive, there is a shoot out and then they are ALL PLAYING SKEE BALL TOGETHER on the pier. It's that disjointed. I tried to watch a few episodes of S3, but bailed.It's awful",negative
"First season got me completely hooked from the beginning to the end. Then 2nd came and it was a filler season, pretty much nothing happened and the series got more philosophical and boring and I kinda had to force myself to complete it. By the beginning of the 3rd season I had completely lost interest in these characters and in their faiths, and I also found myself tired of the characters problems. I really tried but it's enough for me. They promissed us a great hacker series but this ended to be more like V for Vendetta, more focused on the anti hero and political with not so much hacking. Although the concept works fine in movies in a series its a stretch and eventually just became boring.I still have to make an honorable mention to Sam Esmail's direction, amazing cinematography!",negative
"One the best show ever!!!
The script, acting, directing and storytelling are all flawless! it is a shame that not many ppl know this show.",positive
Nothing beats Mr robot and rami malek's acting! Season 1 is inspired from Fight club which i really like as there is No plagiarism. I recommend Everyone to watch this show!,positive
"I think too many people are obsessed with the story being about a hacker and that kinda steals the spotlight that should shine in other places. Firstly, one major problem with the movie is that IMHO it tries to address a kind of ""stereotypical"" hacker the way the world sees one: antisocial, is horrible at talking to people in real life, anxiety attacks in social interactions, ""cool, underground"" friendship/organization going on and whatever else... and oh yeah - the last episode in the first season is very close to ripping off The Fight Club, won't tell how as not to spoil but you'll know it when you see it. Besides that is the issue of hacking itself which is spoon-fed to the audience as quick flashing screens, some 1'st person perspective of the main character talking/watching this, some simplified explanations... and in 30 secs or less its's done. And by the way the lead actor was obviously chosen for his appearance and voice, so be prepared for loads and loads of nerdy, deliberately squeamish voice that is irritating as h*ll. The rest of the movie is basically soap. And that's my main problem with it: too much soap. It also takes twists and turns every once in a while for spontaneous but extensive character development. An OK thing to do, but it gets boring. Oh yeah, adds even more soap!All in all an okay series to kill time, ""B-series"" struggling to become ""A minus"" but it does not know how to do it.",negative
"This show is something that can never be topped. It targets & brings out so many topics of society. It focuses on what we may fear the most someday. It's so nail-biting, hours will go by and you won't get enough of it.
Sam Esmail is a creator that's above all well known ones like GoT & whatever hit drama shows you know of.
Oh and the actors. Whatever I say will never be enough credit to them. And the cinematography. Damn, it keeps you on the edge at all times.
This show will be an revelation to you. Don't miss out, you'll regret it.",positive
"OK, so the first and the second episode were really GOOD! Something new and refreshing, but as soon as we see that he's just a junkie- geek-looser it started to go down down down down into the trash can.How could the ruin a show with so much potential with the psychopath plot. Come on!? Couldn't you come up with something new, something original, so you gave us a psychopath/junkie?! Ahhh so mad at this! They are doing the same with FearTheWalking dead, like all the young people today are drug addicts... If they would stay with the computer and hacker side of the story this would be a 10/10 show, but it's only a 2/10 now...So sad...will probably not watch season2, unless they decide to leave this crap in the past and concentrate on the technology, plot twists, politics, economy etc...",negative
"My son Jay put me onto the TV show Mr Robot because he heartily enjoyed it, and I am really glad that eventually got around to catching up with it.I have now watched chunks of it over a wide period of time such that, I am now having to re-watch it try and remember what I have actually seen.Given the nature and subject matter of this show I consider that it is more than somewhat ironic, that this is marketed by Amazon of all global capitalist corporations.As such Amazon is many things many people, and to me it is a quintessential corporate parasite. It represents much of what the fSociety 'Rebels' are supposed to be against Corporate Greed, manifested in its CEO who was made so much out of it that he can play at Star Trek with Captain Kirk. Amazon's profit margins are continually swelled by their, demeaning attitudes to and treatment of their workforce.Amazon is atypical as a capitalist mega corporation, in setting up its business operations in low to no tax environments.In my neck of woods Britain Amazon appears to have some form of sweetheart deal with the Conservative Administration, regarding the amount of Corporation Tax that it is allowed to pay. Which is sweet FA it is allowed to get away with this on the spurious rationale, that it has little to no actual business base in the country. Whereas in actuality Amazon has a verifiable plethora of different business offices etc, so why do they continue to get away with avoiding so much tax payments?Unfortunately such is the hold of capitalism on the hearts and minds of the populace, that much like the citizens of this series people can still be expected to actually queue up for more.",positive
"Mr Robot is one of the most brilliant, underrated series ever made. The only negative thing I can say is that waiting for each season to be released was incredibly hard! Wow, what a rollercoaster ride of a show. Amazing performances from all the actors, incredible direction and filming with a mind-blowing script has made this one of my favourite series to date. And the last season was perfectly executed, I cannot fault anything. This series will change the way you view the world, I will definitely be watching this from the start again.",positive

"At the conclusion of the pilot episode, the main character asks the audience if we are seeing what he is seeing. The answer is yes! And we definitely want to see more and more. The challenge for this new USA show is to maintain the same level of grit and uncertainty throughout the season, and hopefully seasons to come. The performances are all top notch and nuanced in their own way. The addition of Christian Slater seemed odd, initially. As the titular Mr Robot, I am curious to see how how his character will develop. I have high hopes for this show and was riveted by the pilot. It's not pretty to watch, and that in itself is a key selling point. One scene, shot in times square dulled down the atmosphere to present a muted colour palette that suits the tone of the show. The mist exciting new show of 2015. 10/10",positive
"Starting from season 1, how we get involved in Elliot's life is the art by the writers and directors. Actors remarkably nailed it. And the best part is the psychological envelope of Elliot Alderson. Who he is? Why is he doing this? And so many questions are answered at accurate point of time. Psychological thriller is my favorite genre so far and this 'art' tops that list. And being a programmer, I loved and learned the stuff this hackerman does.",positive
"After watching Mr. Robot virtually everything else on television seems rather timid and formulaic. It's refreshingly rare that an ongoing series these days takes chances not only with plot and character, but stylistically. Every show presents a new surprise and original techniques to tell a story. Not merely technically flashy, the use of camera and editing always contributes an extra dimension to the emotional and intellectual content of a scene. This is the most intelligent show on the screen.",positive
"Honestly, this show has really frustrated me, and I'm sure a lot of other fans as well. The characters, the acting has no doubt been excellent , 10/10. But let's get to the story.This show deserves a 9/10 only if it's considered as a show about a guy battling with mental health disorders. But right from the start we are plunged into a world of hackers, scheming corporates, and a plan to bring down the world's most powerful organization. That is what excited me, and I am sure most viewers.After 4 seasons of one plot twist after another - with one recurring theme, i.e. Elliott almost always has no idea who he is, what he is up to, what is real, what is not.....after 4 seasons of all this, turns out we don't find out much, except for Elliot's multiple personalities (you thought he was one guy? He's actually 2? Oh no wait, it's actually 3....oh but wait....I mean, are you kidding me? Shocking plot twists in a great story are always welcome, but when it reaches the point that the viewers just Never know what's going on, if what they are watching is a dream, reality, parallel reality....it just becomes a joke.Die hard fans are going to call my criticisms the actual beauty and whole point of the show....but in the end, the show should be for the fans, for the viewers, and after 4 seasons of watching such a heavy show, practically every plot point seems to have been trivialized, and I am just left highly disappointed and kind of pissed off.Also, what of Whiterose's machine, the only other massive plot point? We never really get to know what it was. Was it just some delusion of Whiterose? And how was Angela convinced it worked? I guess cuz...she was delusional too??? Basically all the key characters on this show have mental issues of some sort and the entire show has become just about how they deal with them, rather than an actual, ""real"" plot.....of course this begs the question...what is real? What is not? WHATEVER.",negative
"If for nothing else, ""Mr. Robot"" is a show that definitely resonates with you.It's a show tailor-made for this world of big corporations, looming terrorist threats and technological cultures just as much as it is geared toward a very generation-exclusive ambition of changing the world by empowering the everyday citizen against the billionaires, the people Elliott, the show's protagonist, believes to be the shadowy figures pulling all the strings.""Mr. Robot"" runs with Elliott's persistently cynical worldview, his paranoid ideas that the corporations are controlling everything and his vexing belief that money is a governing force, not a means of trade. These viewpoints propel the show forward and provide it with its momentum, which makes ""Mr. Robot"" instantly different than every other show on television and every show in recent memory: it's not governed by plot, it's governed by character and perspective. Specifically, just the character of Elliott and just his perspective.How much you enjoy the show is nearly entirely dependent on how much you like Elliott as a character. Rami Malek does an excellent job when it's time for his violent bursts, and performs the nervous fits and the neurotic small-talk just as convincingly, but it ultimately comes down to the writing — about half of Elliott's lines in the show are done in a monotone voice-over. That's an incredibly bold decision to make for your lead character and your chief method of communicating thoughts to the audience, but it's also the show's deepest flaw, in my opinion. If you love his voice-over, it's because you have a heightened tolerance for a very specific type of writing, which I do not.The foremost issue with this type of voice-over — the persistently monotone kind — is that Rami Malek could be the best actor in the world and still not be able to elevate the material. It will only ever be as good as the writing, which unfortunately pendulates between slickly entertaining and eye-gougingly irritating and amateur.It takes talent and care to painstakingly create an atmosphere for your show, but it's the laziest and easiest tactic to get your main character to tell the audience everything they need to know to have the most involving time with the narrative.Let's talk about the narrative, which is about as clean and well put-together as an alcoholic man in a gutter. The first two episodes have no driving force, they're just showcases for Elliot's annoying character. It's one thing to have a character as charismatic and likeably slimy as Frank Underwood leading a show with no narrative except ""Hey, let's follow this character around and see what happens!"" but this show's lead is the most uncharismatic, unlikeable lead I've seen in a TV show in a long time.But back to the narrative. Our hero spends a few episodes dating with his drug dealer, then some guy who knows her kidnaps her, and Elliott must break said guy out of prison if he wants his girlfriend back. These shenanigans last an entire episode and, at the end, she's not even still alive. It sets Elliott back so much that the rest of his little hacker unit doesn't hear from him for months. But the worst part is that, not only is the episode irrelevant because the characters and events don't meaningfully effect the rest of the season, but it's irrelevant because there's absolutely no need for Elliott to ""go dark"" — to borrow some hip hacker lingo — for months on end. It doesn't change the story at all. Speaking of changing the story, we never get an explanation for how Elliott didn't know his family was in his hacking group. We also never get an explanation for how he was hallucinating his father. Or how he could have a conversation with Tyrell in the back of a van but have Tyrell talk to Elliott later like the conversation never took place. The most we get is Christian Slater's character telling Elliott in a throwaway line that he must have been taking drugs that had been fixed by E-Corp so Elliott would forget his family. But even that is called into question because Christian Slater's character is just a figment of Elliott's imagination, so what he's saying is what Elliott just wants to tell himself.On top of that, a ridiculous portion of our time is spent with the main antagonist, a lizard wearing human skin that's trying to become the CTO (I know, I think it should be CEO too) of his company, Evil Corp. (The show is so enamored by its own assured intelligence and its own assuredly interesting main character that every time the company is mentioned, its name suddenly becomes Evil Corp instead of E-Corp. How clever us writers are!) But yet, the MAIN ANTAGONIST of the show doesn't even interact with our hero more than about three very brief times during which nothing of consequence happens. It's quite bizarre. His dealings with the company also have little to no influence over Elliott's story and it is Elliott's story, so it is puzzling as to why we spend so much time with this character.If you like the show, then fine. Honestly, the writing is pretty good when we're unnecessarily feeding focus to the villain and the camera-work is impressive because of the intent behind the style. Isolate the characters in the frame to show they're alone against this big, uncertain system. But for me, the characters are all far too annoying to invest any time in, the writing is too sophomoric for me to not groan twice a minute, and the talking-to-the- audience gimmick gets old before Malek finishes the opening monologue of the pilot episode.So yes, it's different. It's a show held up by viewpoints, not plot and not characters. But it just doesn't draw me in when I find all of the viewpoints represented here to be annoying, droning garbage.",negative
"The obvious plot twist is clear for everyone. I keep asking myself when will it be revealed.In my opinion (not that it matters) Rami Malek is one of the best actors of his generation & he nails this part. He has that effortless ability of make-believe that can't be learnt, it just is. All the cast do their jobs, basically the acting is very good.However, as of yet, I'm not totally convinced by the show itself. When something like this is attempted it can't miss a beat or the whole story comes crashing down & there are a few wavering moments.It could be average or great, so far, I'll go with 8. < That's a poem.*FOLLOW UP: I've reduced my original score of 8 down to 6 as the fears I expressed in my original review have materialised. Basically the storytelling (the most important part) has come off the rails. The show has descended into an over-stylised disjointed pottage. The soul has been lost, which is always the greatest risk when you take on a story of this kind.Kudos must be given for the attempt, but style over structure never wins when it comes to stories. Remi Malek continues to be a superstar as does Christian Slater, who is an actor we see far too little of these days, far too little!I won't carry on watching as they've lost me in the last few weeks & as I have a life (although I do enjoy a good TV show) I shan't be sticking with anything that doesn't keep me entertained. As with all failed shows, the writing was the let-down. 27/08/2015",negative
"Writing a short placeholder, will perhaps return to this later (am mid-season, season two).A huge 10, certainly some of the greatest drama and science fiction I've ever seen. Beautifully made all around, just impeccable craftsmanship, but also great artistry on the part of the actors (well, of Rami Malek really), and Sam Esmail and his glorious writing.The characters are all so vivid and crazy in their own rights, I love the careful and patient observation each episode delivers. Perhaps only a fellow introvert can appreciate that pained and beautiful sort of enquiry into human personality.Did a very perfunctory search on ""sam esmail dostoyevsky"" and without digging too deep (for fear of discovering spoilers), found what appear to be a couple of articles written by Sam about Dostoyevsky. One of my favourite two writers, and midway through episode five of season two, I just felt this uncanny sense that the lyrical and slightly magic-realist way in which Esmail explores madness is very Dostoyevskian, for me at least.Felt like a taste in the mouth, of great books I read many many years ago, and I can't express just how great a compliment that is - to compare anything to books like The Idiot (which is possibly the closest for me, to Mr Robot). And certainly that same sense of revolution, of a society heaving, groaning and creaking at the edges.Unreal that in this time of vivid turmoil in the United States (a saddening period really), you have artists expressing that sense of deep alienation, and extraordinary division, in works like Mr Robot. Creating works of real beauty, which connect to very different societies, but also to turmoil and discovery of individual madness - a time which produced revolutionaries (Dostoyevsky was one himself, for a while) and also great insanity at large in Russian society (world war, a civil war and the communist revolution in quick succession).Wow! Writing about Dostoyevsky and the Russian revolution for a television series review on IMDb which only a handful of people will ever read! I must be the one going crazy here, but I suppose a part of what art does is open one's mind, and produce a rush of new thoughts and feelings.Wow Mr Robot and Sam Esmail, thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart!",positive
It is a shame to have just 21 reword after the great job they did,positive
"This show keeps your attention every single minute, it's one of the best ever. All the actors are exceptional, especially the lead, and the story pulls you in. At times you start wondering if everything you've seen was actually something different, but it always makes perfect sense in the end. The finale was satisfying and respectful of the fans, also perfectly timed. Can't ask for more. Perfect show!",positive
"I can't believe it took me so long to watch this show & part of me wishes I never had. I just want to experience it all for the first time - again. Having said that, I think rewatching will be just as rewarding but in a different way. The series as a whole was pretty flawless. I mean, was it preachy? Sometimes. Were there questions unanswered? Sure. But really - there isn't much wrong with this show. It touched my heart in a deep way - I won't ever forget it. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece!",positive
"Thankyou Sam Esmail, Rami Malek, Christian Slater and all the other actors for taking us to this journey of pure class cinema.I was confident that i will give it 10 stars the whole four seasons until i reached the last episode, i thought this is it, the ending is spoiled and i was hating the episode. But the director SAM ESMAIL
i think this was the best and greatest direction of all time, the way he opened the suspense the way he gave an ending to such a great and complex story was mindblowing and i wasn't expecting that at all.In my opinion this is the best show i will ever watch in my life.The only show that took growth in it's every additional season unlike other shows.",positive
I think the first 2 seasons rate a 9+. I'm starting the 4th season after waiting for a year or so. I'll finish the review then but this was a very special production all around for sure.,positive
"Don't believe all these top positive reviews here. It was so boring and even after the sixth episode I didn't see any further steps. The high ratings here are just to influence the audience for money with all these nonsense parts. I spent more than 30 $ to buy all the box for seasons 1.0-3.0 but was I stupid to trust all these promising critics here. Normally on IMDb I can make a very clear opinion but I think it's not the fault of IMDb but somebody else who writes always the same lines. I expected really more elements for suspense, intelligence, plots and turns. I missed everything of them that i would like to see in a great series.
Don't waste your time. You won't regret and remember my recommendation.
Just one star for Rami Meleks solid performance.",negative
"Not only does this show manage to deal with multitude of themes varying from loneliness to global finance with such accuracy and sophistication it's simply stunning, it also tells an amazing story. The filming, the cutting, the characters, the acting, the sounds, the turnarounds, everything. They also truly put their hands in the mud for doing brilliant background research about hacking and electonics etc., as this is usually the most immersion-breaking thing in any show or movie for tech-sawwy ppl. Perfection from start to finales. Bravo.",positive
Rami Malek and all the other cast members are phenomenal; i never hated a character so much after that short time of being introduced as i do for Janice. The writing of it all is pure talent.,positive
"I review it first time 8/10. View the show for second time, I must change review score to 10/10. THIS SHOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY A MASTERPIECE THAT EVERYBODY MUST VIEW",positive
"So sad this show is done. I still wanted to give my rating and review because honestly, this is one of the best shows ive ever watched. If you want psychological thriller, this is it! I found myself comparing everything in the show to the plot to see how or if it relates. The acting is SUPERB! The ending was absolutely amazing. I could not have asked for a better ending. I feel like we could all possibly relate at one point or another to the narrator/or main characters point of view. I found myself feeling so strongly about the main character and wanting him to be ok. No show has ever made me feel like that. Very addicting! I feel it did not get enough credit. If it had been advertised more in the begining the way it was in the end i think it would have been more well known. So sad its done but glad to have been able to experience it.",positive
"At the start it was often compared to fight club because of similar themes but the show has far outgrown this image.It tackles different themes to great effect, showing a Stanley Kubrick influence as it does this. This Stanley Kubrick influence can be seen in different aspects from writing to cinematography with subtle nods along the way.Like Stanley Kubrick, Sam Esmail tries new things narrativity and visually and does so successfully in my opinion.Its a story which demands 100% of your attention as if you don't you could find yourself a bit lost in the mayhem that occurs but you will be more than happy to give that attention as you lose yourself in the gripping story that is Elliot.",positive
"I enjoyed the clever season 1. Season 2 got a bit complicated but there were some twist in the plot that caught my atention. Season 3 I got completely lost and the preach against capitalism started to get really annoying.
The second season of Mr. Robot was either trying to do too little or too much; I heard an equal amount of complaints that it was moving too slowly and that way too much was happening.",positive
"Mr. Robot follows the story of Elliot Alderson, a vigilante hacker who finds himself involved in a plot to bring down a seemingly ""all powerful"" corporation that is running the world from the shadows. While the series features a narrative that deals heavily with technology, conspiracy, and economic revolution, the real focus is definitely the characters themselves. The plot is beautifully written and executed, it's honestly some of the best writing I have personally witnessed, yet it is the psychological and emotional impact the story has on the characters that resonates most from the show's development. It's rare to find such an interesting and well-written story line that still understands that the characters' growth is the main priority.Of course the fantastic character work would be for nothing without a good cast, and I'm happy to say that this is one of the show's best qualities. Rami Malek in particular is out of this world as Elliot Alderson, I have never seen a performance quite like it. The character is unlike anything I've seen in the visual medium, and I can't imagine anyone else who could not only make it work in the way it did, but also add such human depth to the role. Malek consistently knocks it out of the park throughout the entire show, and I can safely say that between this and his performance in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that he is one of the greatest actors out there. He is not the only acting powerhouse of Mr. Robot, though: Carly Chaikin, Christian Slater, and Martin Wallström were all simply incredible in their respective roles... as were Grace Gummer, BD Wong, Bobby Cannavale, Portial Doubleday, Michael Cristofer, Gloria Reuben, and essentially the rest of the cast in its entirety.There are many more things to say about what the show does right. The cinematography is some of the finest in television, with experimental shots, framing, and editing that give Mr. Robot a highly cinematic experience that is unique and instantly recognizable. The show's soundtrack is also very memorable... along with a great original score, every song choices is both unexpected and strangely perfect. The show's overall aesthetic has a feel all its own, one that is utterly captivating. I could go on and on about the little details that add to the experience of this show.The one thing that stands out to me the most, though, is the obvious care and attention to every detail from creator Sam Esmail. Esmail fully planned the storyline out beforehand (originally intended to be a feature film), and he knew exactly where he wanted to go with it. As a result, Mr. Robot not only comes to a satisfying conclusion, but the script of every episode from the first to the last was written with that goal in mind. This alone makes for a great show, but Esmail goes above and beyond in crafting each episode. The entire show is filled with brilliant foreshadowing, tiny references, hidden clues, and seeming innocuous details that all add to a viewing experience that is all but impossible to find in serial drama series. Mr. Robot fires on all cylinders in terms of quality, but it the way that Esmail put so much of himself into every every scene, every line, and every shot of the show that allows his vision to truly shine.I fully believe that Mr. Robot is one of the very best series ever, but it is not for everyone. For one thing, it very much embraces its own unique style, and I'm sure there are many out there who may be put off by some of the show's more experimental qualities. It is also not a show for anyone looking for ""easy"" entertainment, that is to say a show that doesn't require much investment or thought (and there is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying this type of media). Mr. Robot can be stressful, confusing, and often times it can touch on some pretty heavy stuff. Truthfully it is anything but an ""easy watch"", but if you know this going in and enjoy this kind of ""cathartic"" media you may find something special in Mr. Robot.",positive
This is the best series i've ever watched and surely ever Will see. I can't Imagine anything even comparable to this piece of art. I'm truly grateful to everyone involved for making this mind blowing story to happen. Thank you!,positive
"So I watched two seasons of Mr. Robot.I waited to write this review after two seasons because i noticed that everybody just sees the pilot and start loving or hating the show based on that alone.And most reviews for a TV show on IMDb is based on just the pilot. i know it can be helpful to know just what you're getting into, But i also think it's not fair to the show whether it's good or bad. I've seen bad shows get good reviews based on the pilot, then turning to crap by the fifth episode and the other way around. So i wait to cast my opinion on TV shows. So two seasons in Mr. Robot is turning out to be a very good show , it's got good acting, directing and writing.The Story keeps you on the edge of your seat.And there are shocking moments in every corner. It does get slow in the middle that's why I gave it a 9. Otherwise It's an Excellent show with a new and realistic look at the world of hacking and crime, it deals with very strong ideas and has complex characters.",positive
This is a show that isn't mainstream isn't something the cool kids talk about heck hardly anyone in your circle will know this but this is arguably the best show on television with exception of maybe a couple. It's one of those things I'm glad I got to enjoy in my time on this place we call earth.,positive
"This show has greatness in it. there is so much i love, yet there is a lot i dislike. certain episodes are amazing, while others are hard to get through. rami malek is AMAZING throughout. most of the characters were believable, but some were outlandish. you can't expect me to believe there is someone that looks, talks and dresses like this. they just try too hard to be weird and difference, and it ends up feeling over-indulgent and pretentious. the same can be said about the show in general... but not always.Season 1: 7/10 (1 viewing, 3/2020)
season 2: 6/10 (1 viewing, 4/3/2020)
season 3: 5/10 (1 viewing, 4/2020)
season 4: 5/10 (1 viewing, 4/12/2020)season 4 was looking like it could be the best, but they messed it up with one of the most baffling decisions regarding the structure of the final season...
SPOILERS
they decide to have the climax happen in episode 9 of 13. just to be clear, the main villain is defeated by the hero with 4 episodes left in the series. talk about anti-climactic. even worse, the final 4 episodes are a delusion. it makes sense from a character perspective, yet it's a terrible decision for the structure of the final season.",negative
The last season maybe best season I ever watched (compared to all other series).Season 2-3 were not that good. It was difficult to stay tuned. But it was worth in the end.The first seasons I also thought that there would be some anti-capitalistic intention by the writers. I was completely wrong.,positive
"Review of Season One: The first episode of MR. ROBOT was cracking stuff. It promised a hacking-based conspiracy thriller with lots of corporate espionage, suspense, and anarchic plots to bring down capitalist society. It looked to be a show to make hacking both fun and suspenseful. Basically, it had potential in spades. So what happened? The second episode was only average by comparison, and by the third episode I wasn't really enjoying it anymore. And then the large and rather important plot twists started hitting, and I realised that MR. ROBOT wasn't original at all, and not even about hacking. Instead it's a cheap, generic, left-wing rip-off of similar movie fare like FIGHT CLUB and V FOR VENDETTA, a series more concerned with pushing a liberal agenda than telling a real story.THE PACIFIC's Rami Malek is a good choice for lead, all bug eyes and angst, but his acting begins to get more and more over the top as the series progresses. Christian Slater is always a welcome presence in either film or TV but is sorely underutilised. The rest of the cast is made up of unpleasant characters, from the airhead blonde would-be girlfriend to the dirty, unpleasant, and sullen fellow hackers who are so rude that you want them all to be erased from the screen. I was really disappointed by all the wasted potential here, and the way the writers go down all-too-familiar routes instead of creating something genuinely fresh and new. By the time MR. ROBOT finishes, it has become the most pretentious drivel ever, and exactly the type of show I hate.",negative
"Very unpredictable and thought provoking. If you enjoy psychological thrillers, that stem from realism, this is a great show to see. While the main character is not the most relate-able, his development as a character is phenomenal. The modern concepts that this show tackles are very real and provocative. It could be faster moving, but its story is unraveled in a way that will keep you guessing and wanting more. 9 out of 10.",positive
Loved this show. Such a high quality show that keeps you hooked!,positive
"I first saw Mr. Robot when the pilot aired back in 2015. I remember how confused I was that, such a seemingly brilliant show, was on USA. I went on to watch each episode religiously and have re watched the series at least 7 times. I've never felt more emotionally connected/touched by a show in my entire life. I LOVED breaking bad, but I still have to give the nod to Mr. Robot.It's upsetting that this show didn't get the recognition it deserved. I'd blame that on the seasons being quite spaced out in terms of release dates, and the fact it was on USA. It's a shame, really, that it didn't reach a broader audience.It's also, in my opinion, a shame that this show is ONLY an 8.5 on IMDB, in comparison to other shows rated in the 9's.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but this is single handedly the most amazing, beautiful, brilliant television show I've ever watched, and I have a tough time believing anything will ever top it in my books.Thank you, Sam Esmail, Rami and cast, everyone involved! I miss this show immensely.",positive
"Funny how after a stream of popular bad reviews there are a few lone ravers bigging up this excuse of a 'high tech' show.Guess the money must be made back after the kids have gone crazy with a jkrowling mess of a script.I wouldn't mind the political angle if it wasn't so blatantly one sided.So all of Elliot's problems would be nullified if Trump disappeared? Great, so let's assassinate him and turn the clock back to the days of Weinstein 'the god' film producer, 'hooks in my heart' Streep and 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman'.Where's my heroin?",negative
"The premise of this show, actually based upon reality but ignored by both the press and most Americans, is actually quite amazing. Anyone that does any research (which I have done - in spades) recognizes that the concept of Americans personal economic well-being, and the reality, don't match. In all first world countries but the U.S., for example, while the universities are ostensibly private, if you are smart enough to get in, they will fund you. Not here. The large specters of student debt and a rampant Wall Street criminal cabal that goes unchecked time after time for illegal financial shenanigans have taken their toll. You can check it out more by comparing GNP (which measures CORPORATE well-being) and other measures of financial well-being such as the United Nations HDI or Human Development Index, which measures PER CAPITA income (individual income). Normalized for INCOME INEQUALITY ADJUSTMENTS - what this show is about, how the top 10% controls 80% of the wealth of the rest of us -- the average United States citizen's HDI index goes from .914 (we rank about 5 world wide) to .755 (we rank around 29 world wide). In reality, the typical American citizen experiences personal economic well-being at about the level of the Czech Republic.If you do a web search for ""inequality adjusted human development index"" you will find the latest report.So I at least celebrate the increasing awareness of the depth and breadth of our financial inequality as compared to the rest of the first world countries in the globe. As a caveat, ironically, there is a lot of research that shows that the lower the HDI (the lower access to higher education, shorter life expectancy, etc.), over time that impacts GNP or corporate wealth. So by pressing the average citizen financially so much that our smart and deserving but poor children can't afford to go to college, we are ensuring lower corporate (GNP) income over time for the United States. Corporations need educated workers. Over time, the best paying jobs, which require higher education, are going overseas because our citizens are too poor to go to college. Indeed one of the latest workforce trends is a high rate of un- filled so-called ""knowledge worker"" jobs concurrent with high unemployment.We are fast becoming, I guess, the version of ""Back to the Future"" where Biff won.I'm not sure I'm in favor of a complete economic meltdown, personally, as advocated by the show's main character, but we can't escape the fact that this kind of show IS -sadly - rooted in absolute economic reality.",positive
"I put off seeing this because too many people recommended it (yes, I know how it sounds) and I wasn't really interested in seeing a nihilist narrative that critiques the information era with the generic complaint that ""we"" are all too complacent/stupid/lazy blah blah blah and deserve to be hammered because we just stick ourselves in the ground like nails without regard for our personal info/security. I KNOW I should do more. We are little men who know little; Elliot is a little man who knows much. The pilot episode contains more bile than the rest of the series, so if you are a little put off but curious at the end of it, I would strongly encourage you to press on. It is an entirely satisfying viewing experience. All three seasons. It is weirdly prescient (eerily so!), and fun to root for the main (unreliable) narrator. I was very fortunate to have avoided all spoilers because I stayed away from reviews. If you are interested in the show, please just watch it and don't read anymore about it. There are multiple ways to see it, and re-watching it is really fun too. I loved the music, the writing, and the stellar cinematography. Every frame is art. I never felt like I was just watching a TV show. Rami Malek, Sam Esmail, Christian Slater---top notch work. A pleasure to see.",positive
"I honestly have to say that I am stunned by the review average here, and even more so by the Golden Globe awarded to the series itself, and especially to Christian Slater.But I suppose most of the reviews date back to the time of the pilot, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Hollywood Foreign Press didn't even bother to watch it past the first episode.Overall the series is just average at best in my opinion, here's why.Pros:the pilot is intriguing, and the general premise new and innovativethe show has a strong main character you can relate to and care about, brilliantly played by Rami Malek the show is authentic with respects to hacking and IT in general, which is refreshingCons:besides the main character, the other characters and their character development are just a mess, in fact you have to wonder why they are even there in the first place, why you should care about them, or why they even have to be in the story, in which they play no essential role whatsoeverThe whole Tyrell Wellick storyline for example is just a huge and very cheap rip-off of American Psycho mixed with a little bit of the Underwoods from House of Cards. Only that Tyrell Wellick is acting so stupid that you have to wonder why he even got his current job this way in the first place. If you wanna be CTO of a global company, and you are outrun by a competitor, just try to f*** his wife, that's the great plan? Jesus! And how was all of this relevant to the storyline?And Angela does exactly what? I mean even she doesn't know obviously, and I don't know why she is even there. I know they are trying to play this whole ""I was fighting the good fight, but now I'm stuck with this evil company I was trying to fight, and I kinda like it"" ambiguity, but come on! Would be more realistic if she didn't start out in some kind of middle management position at an IT-Company to begin with.realism: while the hacking stuff might be realistic, the rest for sure is not. No, no global company would hire someone that somehow managed to expose their darkest secrets and put many of their former members of the board in prison potentially. No, no global company would survive having caused (or being the starting point) of a global financial meltdown of that dimension. No you can't just walk into your IT-security company and get passed security with the ID of your coworker, then log in with that ID, and then plant a virus into the system, they would know it was you (cameras anyone?).-storyline: the storyline is basically one hack after the pilot. Whereas in the pilot we get to know the hacker Eliott and his view of the world, and the people he hacks, which is pretty exciting, all of that is kind of washed away by a drug/ psychic component combined with one great hack to change the world by a group clearly inspired by Anonymous in real life.-twists and ending of S1: the great twist of S1 is unfortunately and disappointingly a big rip-off of Fight Club, and the ending of S1 is neither the closure of a chapter of a storyline nor a cliffhanger, it's just confusing and makes you wonder if you really want to watch a S2.",negative
"I waited for the first season to end before writing a review. The first season's pilot was well built, captivating and overall great. After the pilot the quality of the script went down. First point, the protagonist, Elliot, became boring. He uses drugs, he is mentally ill, talks to himself(or the people watching) he is not confident, his skills as a computer geek are not fully shown, he is described as a ""genius"" but doesn't show it, nothing too special about him. Second point, the rest of the characters don't have the depth i wished for, i can not root for them, they do not evolve much.Third point, the show is similar to the show ""Hannibal"" from the filming perspective, the protagonist being a highly intelligent man but delusional and the vibe you get from watching this show.I hope the directors get their heads straight and get this show to be better or I am afraid it will end up cancelled as Hannibal did.Pilot: 9.5/10 Rest of season 1: 8/10 Season 2: 7/10",negative
"So I watched S#1- entertaining, interesting. S#2- it got weird, not in a good way, meandering; the flip flop, who's good who's bad, what is really happening. Who or what is Slater? As if, by being confusing, and ""twisty""- it creates intrigue. I gave up. No integrity.
now I see it's up to S#4- I will go back and take another look- should I re-start from the beginning. I guess it wants to be like the Matrix and Dark City. what's real, what isn't. are we all living in a reality designed by computers.

Great Work!!!",positive
"Season 1 got me so hung up. The season was brilliant, original with great character and original story development. The themes treated were new and never seen on a general public TV series. Also it uncovers a world of hacking with great accuracy and inspiration. Elliot's story was completely unexpected and all the side stories were intriguing. Season 2 is just a disaster. I don't know what happened to the authors. I have already spent 6 hours of my life watching Elliot talking to himself trying to fight his other him with absolutely no purpose. Also the original story has been partially abandoned and it is moving forward without Elliot. I am sure they will connect them at some point but the current situation is that the series is NOT entertaining. Several times I find myself just checking my FB while watching those infinite pointless monologues which very poorly describe Elliot's mind and have nothing to do with what's going on around the world. Also most of the time they are shallow and repetitive with no main thread. What are they trying to describe? The mind of an autistic? A man's refusal of society? I still don't get it.The direction is becoming too pretentious. the movie is beautifully shot. Experimenting is great, photography is master but nothing makes sense without an interesting story to tell. This is not 8 1/2, it does not have the premises to be like that nor is what people are expecting to see. A TV series and a movie are two different things. I will keep on watching the whole season 2 and decide if to move forward with season 3....I hope the things improve.",negative
"I have to say, Mr Robot thrilled me during season 1 but I also sat many times through parts I wasn't so sure about. Some patches were breathtaking, others too obvious, some scratching on boredom. By the end of season 1 I was even a bit cautious if I should check out season 2. Of course I watched it anyway, and whereas it was a bit of a struggling through the first two, quite slow-paced and patient episodes, from the third one onward it hits a stroke that wasn't there before, more depth and detail, but also more chaos...all dissolved in a beautiful black void, shaken well, and served in a champagne glass with a cherry on its edge. Hats off to Mr Robot second season!",negative
"i absolutely love this; the writing, the acting, the casting, the lighting, the props, the direction, everything about it. its just such a fine piece of art that i can watch it time and time again and all my friends that i saw this to are just amazed by it and completely hooked. as with everything its hard to maintain the taut atmosphere, ambiance and knife edge on all episodes and series but despite the up and down, overall it stays true to its quality, vision and originality. well done amazon for commissioning such an amazing generational cannon of work.",positive
"The main character speaks like a robot and I thought he was Mr Robot; but within minutes it is revealed it wasn't him.Very boring, nothing happens really.No character is endearing or smart.I don't understand why it is compared to Dexter, Dexter is smart and the show was fast paced and there was a story.",negative
"Honestly, it was clear to me extremely fast what this show is all about. Story is so subtle that it feels like it was made in Soviet union 30 years ago to check how Americans are ""breathing"". Corporations are ""evil"", money is root of all bad things that happen, poor are poor because someone is exploiting them, profit has none other purpose than to destroy honest people, being indebted to someone is creditor's fault, redistribution is the key to everything. When I look at comments below, I am honestly scared. Your government is now of gigantic proportions, they are telling you who to hire, who to fire, what can you say and what you can't, what can you own, how much, and what you can't. Once free country is now 42% owned by the government (% of government spending as part of total GDP). Way is clear for USA, left, left and more left. I have a bad feeling you are knocking on the wrong door when it comes to search for the root of your problems. Remember that Americans never experienced alternative to everything that is perceived as ""bad"" in this show. Some of us did and I'm urging you to reconsider. You have no idea where this road you are taking will lead you...",negative
"This show is brilliant. I rebuilt a friendship over having to discuss this show. True sci-fi. The tech is cutting edge and accurate. The world/universe building is incredible. And an interesting and uncomfortable social commentary.I can't really say much else other people haven't said: brilliant acting, well written, uses the entire medium brilliantly, using all kinds of visual and sound cues, so when twists are revealed you suddenly realize the information was there all along.I binged watched the entire thing before the last season. It doesn't quite reach the enraging level of disappointment that ""Lost"" reached, but last episode left me with the feeling, ""Oh, well, nevermind.""",positive
"Brilliant series following Elliot, a socially awkward cyber security expert/hacker. Series one starts off well and promises us a real treat for hacker fans. As a cyber security expert myself I have to say that Mr Robot deals with factual commands and the use of Kali Linux which as far as I know hasn't been shown before. There is careful emphasis on not showing too much coding for obvious reasons. As the seasons go on the story line seems to peter off from the practical hacking and starts to explore personal story lines which is a bit of a let down. A lot of talk but no action in latter seasons. Becomes more of a drama than a cyber series.",positive
No sense No coherence No interest. The characters are just unbelievably unbelievable. The main character is almost comatose. The others are just annoying. The Villain is a super human omniscient conductor... Really? The story line is completely anarchic. It is like we're living in Elliot's head and it's not a nice place to be. Not because it uncomfortable and edgy but simply because it is lame and uninteresting. The whole thing is just confused and seems to be going nowhere. A drug induced experience but in a bad trip kind of way. Who wants that? Sorry Mr. Robot please power down.,negative
"Hats off Sam Esmail, brilliant show great story and the end was stunning.

2. ""The top 1% of the 1%. The ones in control. The ones who play god without permission.""",positive
"I think Mr. Robot is the best TV series made at least during the past decade. It is way more than just a ""hacker-series"" how it is usually called.It contains not only an interesting story with complex twists which never existed like that in series before, good / partially outstanding actors, deep atmosphere with touching emotional scenes, and also fascinatingly dry & brutal action scenes. It also creates a direct connection to the actual world we are living in, shows us our society, economy and progress of technology from a different, negative perspective, in a very realistic way. On the other hand this series also connects all these things with us: Humans with all the issues we have in our non-perfect lives, with private tragedies, failures and unfulfilled dreams. The result is something positive, gives hope, and also motivates to change things and thoughts.Mr. Robot doesn't force the viewer to continue watching episode by episode with aggressive cliffhangers. But it is totally worth it to watch all 4 seasons until the very end. Do it!",positive
"Me, being a computer geek who built his 1st 'puter around 1980, thought this was a geek hacker show. It's not really. Though I did enjoy watching the hacker's codes and reminiscing. This is a 'lets shove some political agenda' onto everyone's screens. I generally binge watch these. This should have taken 10 days-2 weeks? It took 3 months. The 4th season is the worst. I wished they would have spent more time on the hacking stuff and less time trying to socially re-adjust everyone. In my world of rating, this was not worth watching the 1st time...",negative
"Just finished the first season. I also happen to be a networking engineer, with a certificate and whatnot. I don't work in a cyber-security company, but I get as close to hacking as you can without being a hacker, so here's the opinion of someone who knows what they're talking about.I'm compelled to say the show was shite after seeing the final episode, but it really wasn't. It was mediocre, and just that. Stilted ""techy"" dialogue, ridiculous events that make no sense, blatant rip-offs of better films... and don't forget the pretentious dialogue.But hey, we've got Christian Slater! That's great!So, what've we got? Rami Malek plays Elliot, a hacker who works at a cyber-sec company and suffers from some undetermined mental illness pretending to be social anxiety disorder. (Really like Rami Malek - he does a great job of playing the character.)In the beginning, Elliot pretends to be a vigilante whilst imagining people in suits which are following him. He then gets laid a bunch of times, does drugs a lot, fights crime, commits crime, ""hacks"" things in a usually impossible fashion, and suffers from his mental disease. He also stares at people a lot with wide eye-pupils. Insert a load of subplots: Elliot's ""best friend"" and crush Angela and her goofy moronic boyfriend (my favourite character, can't stop laughing when he's on screen); a Swedish ""villain"" who is too idiotic to have gotten to his high post in the first place, and his kinky psycho wife; people serving the Chinese hacker group ""Dark Army"" (2spooky4me), and amongst them a guy named Cisco (As a Cisco Certified engineer I take great offence at that); the other hackers of Mr Robot's gang (which Elliot joins); other evil corporate people.Evil people? Yep, loads of 'em. And all of them like to ruin people's lives, like to get rich, like to laugh at people's misery. They love beating others up, killing them, destroying them. And they're as evil and as corporate as they can get. No character development anywhere there.The viewers are - usually a few times per episode - spoon-fed the blatantly obvious ""ermahgerd corporations are evil and rich people are evil"" message, along with some other bullshit that I was too bored to pay attention to.The plot has a very predictable twist, one ""inspired"" by (i.e. ripped off of) an iconic film (but I won't tell you what it is, for only the name will be enough for you to realise what this show's twist is), and the final episode of season 1 attempted to mimic the ending of ""V for Vendetta"" to an extent, failing dramatically in the process.In conclusion, I'm going to miss the pretentious dialogue, Angela's confused face, her goofy (ex-)boyfriend, and Rami Malek's perfect drug-addict impersonation. And the soundtrack is pretty good too. I like some of the ""tenser"" recurring themes associated with particular characters.6/10: Ain't that awful, but there's better media to be consumed.",negative
"I know it's meant to be good, but it's pretty dull, so I stopped watching after a season... Or possibly just some of the first season. I forget either way, as the show made no impact or lasting impression on me.",negative
"I had enough of this show. A huge promise that ended up like a big disappointment.The show ended for me when the mister rational guy killed that woman for no reason at all. I mean, the guy had a rational method even to get rid of his frustrations (paying the beggar to get hit) and then all of a sudden makes a stupid move like that with no actual motivation and worse, the husband knew he had harassed his wife in the night before the murder, not to mention his DNA and prints were all over the lady. I also hated the evil queen stereotype of his wife. Also, what is the point of Ellyot right now?So this is it. Lots of stereotypes like the evil queen, the crazy hero and so on. Very little consistency on developing characters.The writers are pretty much lost and it seems to me the show is written on the go with no cohesion and no planning at all.Avoid it at all costs.",negative
"(Updated after Season 2).Set in today's times, Elliot Alderson (played by Rami Malik) is a young analyst at a tech company, Allsafe. Allsafe provides servers and protects client companies from hackers and other threats. Its biggest client is the largest company in the world, E-Corp. Elliot is approached by a shadowy man to hack, and ultimately bring down, E- Corp. Elliot knows the shadowy man as Mr Robot...Season 1 was great: a clever, intriguing, gripping drama. Very plausible - after this I worry about the systems of all the companies I am a client of. Had a lot of similarities with Fight Club (even down to ""Where is my mind?"" being used as an outro in an episode). At first I found this annoying, as, even though Fight Club is a brilliant movie, it diminished the originality of Mr Robot. However, Mr Robot is original enough to stand on its own two feet. The Fight Club similarities and references do not make Mr Robot predictable in any way. If anything, Mr Robot is a serialised homage to Fight Club.Parts of Elliot's character are also very similar to those of Dexter, of the series of the same name. Also, no issue there.Good work by Rami Malek in the lead role. Good support from Christian Slater, Portia Doubleday and Martin Wallstrom.Season 1 was far from perfect, however. The final episode is very subdued, and pretty much unnecessary. The season could easily have ended with the 9th episode. There are also a few episodes near the beginning where the series drifts a bit. Plus, you get the feeling that the makers of the series revel in the idea of cyber-terrorists disrupting / destroying a major corporation...After the good groundwork and plot development of Season 1, I was hoping for some more solid plot development in Season 2. Sadly, no such luck. Season 2 pretty much just drifts and consists mostly of filler. The first six episodes were in intriguing in that they seem to be setting up for something dramatic. Unfortunately, that something turned out to be a damp squib - the writers did a Dallas and made everything involving Elliot in those six episodes occur in his own mind. Way to pad out half the series...In the remaining six episodes we just have dramatic filler. Subterfuge for the sake of subterfuge, with the flimsiest of reasons for it. The best example of this is the character of Angela (Portia Doubleday) who spends the majority of her screen time skulking around her office, doing all sorts of tech-oriented nefarious things, for no real purpose (other than for the writers to show off their tech knowledge).There are some bright spots. The FBI agent, Dom, was a great addition to the series. Very clever and resourceful, and well played by Grace Gummer, she was a character you could root for. Sadly, being on the wrong side of the law (ie the good side, in this series), you know she's not going to come out a winner in the end, so it is difficult to support her 100%.Craig Robinson's character was also interesting, but, due to being part of Elliot's daydream, was short-lived.Season 2 ended with the plot hardly much advanced from where Season 1 ended. Not a huge surprise for a drama series - Game of Thrones writers have turned plot non-development into an art form - but I thought Sam Esmail and co would have waited until at least Season 3 before switching to sit-back-and-watch-the-money-come-in mode...8/10 for Season 1, 5/10 for Season 2.",negative
"Wow! That last episode was some heavy lifting.Although I've enjoyed the rhythm and presentation of the series, I've often been lost in the story details. Especially when they time jumped in the 2nd season and then the 3rd resolved everything...well...most everything.Malik has been astounding for the whole run, especially the 4th season episode when he finds out what Mr. Robot/Slater was hiding from him in the 7th show. Even though I could see it coming, the episode was very compelling. Extra points for actor Elliot Villar, too.The interchanges between Elliot and Mr. Robot were much more interesting for this season. A different rhythm to it.When Elliot goes to the other world, that was a bit much. I can't recall (but I guess it happened) the existence of ""The Machine."" So that was a surprise to me.With the almost final scene in the hospital room, was a huge amount of crazy information to sell. Pushing an elephant through the eye of a needle.Thinking about it, didn't initially realize that he ""made up"" just what happened after the explosion in the nuclear reactor. I'd assume that there was an order for the 13 episodes but they initially had material for 10 or 11.Extremely esoteric last 15 minutes, but did work. Really milking it when Elliot is at the window of the skyscraper with his family. And then more in the theater? Too much. But him not being the correct Elliot was interesting but should have been explored long before. Kinda came out of nowhere.As for acting, I hate to say this but the actresses did a fine job but the standout performances were from the men. Likely because they had the more compelling material to work with. Too many to name but most of them.And was it only in season 1 they had that interesting shot composure that put the characters in the bottom right corner? Assuming it was to say that the characters were small in that world.",positive
"I follow the series since its beginning, and it has been an amazing journey, many times I had anxiety, sadness, happiness and laughter with the most emblematic scenes. The travel itself always impressed me, the level of detail that Sam Esmail integrates episode by episode is phenomenal and very valuable for the fans. This series is definitely in my top 3 and the most emblematic of the decade for me, it's very underrated and I wish it had more credit than it has. As for the unanswered questions, it doesn't bother me at all, I don't feel we need to know the absolute truth of things, so as to let our minds and intentions make their own judgment of what happened.A huge congratulation to the cast, to the directors, to all the staff behind the scenes, to the photography that induces us into a different frame than the one we usually see, to the soundtrack for giving the soul to the show, and above all to Sam Esmail, Rami Malek and Christian Slater for telling us a story full of feelings and self-knowledge based on a mental illness, in a true and realistic way, without ceasing to surprise us from the first to the last minute.Recommended for all those who are looking for a different, original, well-directed television series with a solid and accurate story.",positive
"Holy crap, I love this show! How did this get on the USA network? It should have been gobbled up by HBO or Showtime.﻿This show is like the computer and networking equivalent of a medical or legal drama / thriller, something that's been sorely missing in TV.USA put the entire pilot online (check YouTube). Everything about this is great: the acting, the script, the casting, the technical accuracy. None of that NCIS ""four hands on the keyboard"" and ""I'll crack your 4K RSA key in 3 minutes"" BS. I've never understood why obscure medical terminology is OK, but real computer and networking terminology is practically forbidden.I could actually watch without constantly being knocked out of the story with stupid TV-OS made up garbage. This will be, by far, my favorite show of the season.",positive
"In a relatively similar alternate universe, a megacorporation called E Corp exists. E Corp alone has taken the place of Microsoft, Dell, JP Morgan and other large corporations. Overlook the fact that they have not been broken up as a monopoly or trust and they have become the ""big bad"". Introduce Elliott, a depressed and anti-social computer programmer/hacker and an underground anarchist group calling themselves F Society and you have the making of a classic battle between the haves and the have nots. The series has plenty of surprises to keep you tuned in and the plot moves at a good clip to keep your interest. The geek factor is believable, but does not keep the story bogged down.",positive
"The show is not good. Boring. No insight on hackers whatsoever.The most annoying is heavy propaganda messaging. The propaganda messages are:drug use by young people is cool - smoking is cool - a drug addict can be a ""genius hacker"" - unprotected sex, random sex with multiple partners is cool (in reality, there is 100% probability you will get an STD. Note: you never see someone getting an STD in the Hollywood output) - women are raped regularly - muslims wearing headscarf are cool and are revolutionary hackers (in reality, covering head for women is never mentioned in Koran) - Swedish people and Europeans are evil pervertsLearn to spot the propaganda and avoid it. The slightly retarded, which is the new normal today, should not watch. For them it is a danger.",negative
"Elliot Alderson's ""Long Night's Journey Into Day""I became familiar with Rami Malik from his spectacular portrayal of Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" I had read something about him being in a television series called ""Mr Robot"" and nothing else.Well, my husband and I decided to check out ""Mr Robot"" and for one thing we couldn't believe this was the same actor who crawled so skillfully into the skin of Freddie Mercury! Malik has range and I'm sure if he is careful with his career he'll become one of the greatest actors of the twenty-first century.Malik plays a mentally ill computer wiz and hacker named Elliot Alderson whose grip on reality is shaky. His world is dark and drugged. The audience gets pulled into his nightmare world and we see and hear his internal conversations with Christian Slater's character, Mr. Robot.The audience is privy to Elliot's contempt for humanity through his inner monologues which appear to be addressed to an unknown other person. The audience? A hallucination?Some of Elliot's inner monologue is adolescent ""cosmic wool gathering"" of a dangerous kind. He's a hacker of the first order and he using his skills to act out his contempt for a specific group of people. Guess it's better to be a hacker than a mass shooter....But why am I making reference to the classic Katherine Hepburn film ""Long Day's Journey Into Night?"" Both the movie, based on the Eugene O'Neil play and ""Mr. Robot"" are emotional rollercoasters, gut punching and exhausting experiences. The Tyrone and Alderson families are mired in addiction, grief and dysfunction. The Tyrone family unravels by the end of the day and by nightfall leaves them in the metaphorical dark.Elliot's journey begins in darkness and takes his audience through one of the most emotionally exhausting television shows I've ever seen. The show's color palette is grimy, muted and dark. Elliot always appears a bit jaundiced. The colors add to the grimness of both his inner and outer worlds. Elliot eventually escapes his long dark night but getting there was quite the ride.None of the other characters are particularly sympathetic. Darlene is a foul mouthed, but brilliant hacker herself with a loathing for humanity and uses her talents to help Elliott. She uses and manipulates people to get what she wants.Only one of the supporting characters could even remotely be thought of as sympathetic and an innocent. Grace Gummer plays Dominque the FBI agent who gets sucked into the dark story where most everyone involved in that particular subplot ended up dead. She was just working at her job. It was her assignment, nothing more until ""more"" happened.Mr. Robot also featured some incredible bit performances by very talented character actors. There's Janice, played by Ashlie Atkinson, the over-the-top and ever so evil taxidermist. My gawd that character was creepy! Bobby Cannavale's Irving provides a kind of perverse comic relief.And there is one scene that appeared to be right out of Twin Peaks....The hotel lobby with the two door men, one so involved with eating multi-colored cereal and the other one having a lively FaceTime chat in Spanish, that neither see Elliot's coming and going.And the comic relief provided by the sandwich munching dude in the white hazmat suit was sublime!Immerse yourself in the Mr. Robot universe, and when you finally com up for air, enjoy some light hearted fare like ""Good Omens"" starring David Tennant.",positive
"The very beginning of the very first episode will already make it very obvious, what this show it all about. (Not that the rest would at any point start contradicting that.)It pretends to be a show about a ""hacker"" (a term that anyone who actually does such stuff would never ever use to describe it[1])  acting and thinking like a AOL user (who prints out his e-mail) or a iPhone-wielding media industry hipster believes such fictional people to act.But in reality, it's about depicting anyone who's even aware of those who rule from 'behind' the scenes as a ""crazy conspiracy theorist"" with ""mental problems"" like Edward Snowden never happened.  Like Kappa Beta Phi [2] doesn't exist.  Like it's still 2012 and we're all blind believers. A well-known technique of discreditation that was documented[3] in the presentations released by Snowden, and well-known for a long time before that[4].It's very obvious whose interests are pushed here. Especially with the second season being ordered before the first had even aired.I'd absolutely not be surprised, if the budget for this production and the positive ""reviews"" came straight out of the Operation Earnest Voice [5] budget. But I'm sorry mates. Post-Snowden this doesn't work any more.At least it's not yet another show glorifying mass-murder, torture and terror byhe military and the police, like half the other shows released in the USA today.___^ [1] http://preview.tinyurl.com/p4s2ulj^ [2] http://preview.tinyurl.com/mrvhsd2^ [3] http://preview.tinyurl.com/k9hjlnv^ [4] http://preview.tinyurl.com/ye95vgk^ [5] http://preview.tinyurl.com/q8egn3z",negative

"Wish I hadn't paid $25 for this garbage S4!Good God why did this show have to become another irritating show that you sit here and yell at the TV while watching? Once I started saying ""oh come on"" and ""who does that""... I start losing interest with the show real quick! The scene with Elliot running from the cops was just horrible. Who looks back the entire time they're running? How many different things or people was he gonna run in to and fall down? It was like watching a horror movie where the girl runs through the woods while being chased by the killer and she trips and falls over every damn thing... Then he jumps over a ledge and falls a good 40ft onto a concrete sidewalk and slowly walks away unhurt!
Then there's Darlene, bug eyed meth face Darlene... this woman is a moron! I've never seen someone act so tough and then be so stupid and so easy to catch! She's constantly captured and causing problems. She's annoying as F! Easily the worst character on this show! Makes so much noise, acts so arrogant and confident and then fails at everything! Her acting is terrible.How many times are these idiots gonna be grabbed and kidnapped? Have they never heard ""have your head on a swivel?"" Elliot is such a pu$$y too! Gets his ass kicked all the time and he's just pathetic. These characters are all becoming so irritating to watch... God I hope to get all of this over with real soon!",negative

"After watching the excellent and very thought provoking pilot I had high hopes for this series. However, episode 2 made me begin to think it was written exclusively for computer geeks and by episode 3 which was at best an Andy Warhol back drop to an acid induced flower power rock video and at worst a pretentious prick on a big budget, I had come to realise that it was no longer being written by the same people that wrote the first episode!! Surely not!! Or else they had suddenly realised they'd no idea where to go with their creation and dropped a bad tab in their desperation and forgot to write a story!!! Seriously, what on earth were they playing at. Sometimes in the past I've seen some excellent episodesr in series where characters had already been well developed, and where an entire episode is devoted to a dramatically justified extraordinary one off. But to do that in the third episode is stupid, pointless and lazy. Maybe the rest of the series got better, I couldn't care less. They lost me with their pretentious BS!!",positive
"So first of all, before I started watching I had no clue what Mr Robot was about. I taught that it was a neutral series (when you have dark themed - neutral - feel good) but when I watched the first episode I was proved wrong. In the first five minutes you can see Elliot already crying because he is lonely. I didn't mind this, because the dark tone really suited the series. I also think that the first episode, the pilot, was one of the best pilots ever. the only thing that bothered me was the last episode, it was a really good episode, but it wasn't a good ending to the series, it didn't even gave us the answer to the question: who is behind the mask. But what I liked was that they make you believe throughout the series that Mr. robot is real. But at the ending you realize that he isn't and is just a fantasy from Elliot. There are some other twists in the story and I like these as well. And when they kill of Shyla You can feel that (sorry for my language) sh*t is about to get real. And I love these kind of feelings. THe hacking part was a very good aspect of the series. The narration part was very well executed and I taught that it was very original of them that they made an excuse up for it. This excuse was that Elliot mas up this person and started talking to him, this so called person is in reality the audience. Rami Malek as Elliot was really good. This is his best roll by far. He was very convincing as a social anxiety boy. But who is still very smart. Elliot was also a likable character. I very much liked the aspect that Elliot uses his hacking skills to play a 'vigilante' at night Christian Slater was just amazing in portraying Mr. Robot and the speech he gives at the end of the last episode was just so good it gave me chills. The acting overall is excellent just as the writing. Because the writing is so good there is this constant suspense. This is also a very well shot and edited series with very realistic Hacking.Thank you for reading this review, I would definitely recommend this series to everyone who likes a darker, well shot and realistic series. This is by far one of the best series of 2015 and I hope you will like it as well. P.S. fsociety!",positive
"I am so bored by season 2. Too much focus on seeing the world through his lens so we are constantly stuck inside Elliott's head. Very little light is shed on the world post fsociety apocalypse. Probably the show runner (looking at you Sam Esmail) is having a hell of a great time making sure that every detail is exactly as he envisioned it but for the viewer, it is at best, tolerable. I get that we are inside Elliott's not fully diagnosed mind but it is becoming unnecessarily claustrophobic and nothing ever happens (at least not in real life or TV life). Dear USA, don't pass the reins completely to one creative tyrant. you are suffocating the viewer!",negative

"I'm not sure if what I'm going to say qualifies as a spoiler or not, so I did not take any chances. Anyway, the main characters, aside from the Christian Slater character, are all moody 20-somethings with anti-social attitudes. Christian Slater has an anti-social attitude too but he is a 30 or 40-something. Point is; if you're not entertained by moody, anti-social 20-somethings, you won't be particularly entertained by the series. One of the main characters is technology. This can be a problem too. Typing information into a laptop is simply not that entertaining, regardless of how dramatic the background music may be, or how furiously the person is typing. To top it all off, the series is a little too artsy for its own good. I had a tough time keeping up with what was going on. Fortunately, the problems I have cited caused me to lose interest by the end of the third episode, so at least for me, those problems are no longer a concern.",negative
"A guy who look like a cross between Beavis & Butt-Head and a deer in headlight.Which is also he's only expression too. Yup,you're right.We're talking about the weird looking sidekick guy, from the war at home. Someone made a bizarre matrix plot which makes no sense,and dropped him and Christian slater in it as the two leads,and thought it was a good idea.I really wish I could tell you what the series is about,but I really have no idea.I watched the first episode =60 min but understood very little.It had something to do with hacking and financial gain I think.",negative
"It tries too hard to present itself as some type of high art intellectual masterpiece. Really it's just a very gritty fairytale that utilizes tougher tropes.The antagonist is a magical heroic prince that saves the world with impressive ease. Instead of mystical hair or a super voice, it's a hacking and deciphering ability.Yes, there are drug problems, human faults, and disorders but those are amped up as props to showcase a demigod ability to overcome with wits and grit.It's hard to get into shows that spend all of its energy into explaining what is happening and not performing a world or telling a story.Sometimes it gets too gory just for the sake of the shock value and sometimes it gets too dramatic just for the sake of trying to earn accolades. If you fit the niche you'll enjoy it but there isn't much substance as presented.",negative
"I honestly don't know what to tell you about this series. I'm still puzzled.Let's just say:
Hello my friend. There's this new series. Unique. Something you've probably never seen before. With some love for details and an amazing young talented cast. A story just as mind blowing as the Matrix franchise.But... we gotta talk:
While Elliot's background is one of the most disturbing, heart-breaking disasters I've ever seen on tv, I have some issues with the story. Not because I would rule out something like this could ever occur or hasn't happened already. No. It's the depth in which Elliot gets swirled into which makes the story too unrealistic almost a little far-fetched. At least, for me.Plus, I don't feel like I have been given a real closure. Season 4 felt so rushed and chaotic that I had serious issues trusting Sam Esmail's plan for the series finale. And I was right. At the end I got what I felt I didn't want. A spin-off vibe. Urgh.",positive
"After watching the first season I couldn't wait to watch the next one because it was great and amazing but the second season was a complete waste of time.
I was big fun of Mr. Robot after seen the first episodes because they manage to deliver the idea cleverly ""a great topic"" it was new , good and breathtaking, therefore I was looking forward to watch the second season.
The disappointment: after few episodes I noticed that everything is pretty predictable, what a waste of time!!, I decided to stop at season two no more waste of time there are many better series to watch.",negative
"The start is good. Most of all, it is captivating that the hackers are shown relatively realistically here. The main part of hacking is the social aspect, the human factor. And the process itself is not some kind of magic, but a rather routine and lengthy process of collecting information, searching for vulnerabilities, systematic penetration into the attacked object. In most movies/shows, hackers are shown as some kind of goddamn sorcerers who can hack into anything from the phone network to the nearest refrigerator in five seconds from the phone. Which, of course, is the height of absurdity. Usually these are weeks and months of fairly routine work.",positive
"I loved season 1 of this show and would have given a 9/10 score but season 2 just becomes self-congratulatory, confusing and irritating.Watch Seasn 1 and skip the rest!",negative
"It's 80% mental health issues, 10% pointless dialogue/plot, 10% hacking. It has a few great scenes, but a majority of the show is developing a scenario that goes nowhere.",negative
"Would have thought that Rubicon had said it all, but obviously someone thought a long version was needed for those who still need convincing. Note a word about repetitive strain. Pity, a little realism would have helped relieve the tedium.Points are for the unfortunates who had to search out all the nooks and crannies needed to create the dreary atmosphere. Sinatra must be spinning in his grave.",negative
This show is not only about computers and hacking..it's more than a show..it's afeeling emotions and everything,positive
This show is amazing. Rami Malek is outstanding. Season 4 was by far the best all episodes were just amazing especially episodes 5 7 and the season finale. I think season 2 was a little slow and there should have been some editing in season 2 and make the season having 12 instead of 13 episodes. This show always experiments with itself too which makes it different from other shows. Don't miss this show,positive
First episode was good but then it loses momentum and turns into a character study of mental illness and delusional madness. There are long pauses of characters staring into space and monologues and not much happens. Character studies can be fascinating like the Joker and Once upon a time in Hollywood but in a TV show stretched over multiple seasons it becomes monotonous and needs a narrative arch to frame these character moments. Even with fast forwarding it was hard to watch the entire series. Really can't understand the praise for this show.,negative
"Season 1 was a thrill to watch, but after fast forwarding through episode 3 of season 2, I consider myself irretrievably disengaged. The fight club twist messed the story up deeply, it clipped the wings of the future of the show and even ruined what had already happened retroactively. Now it's about possession, hallucinations, psychosis and schizophrenia, all the characters having lost all seeming trace of believability. It started going to strange places in the last few episodes of season 1, and season 2 being so bad really puts season 1 into perspective, I had misjudged its quality. This series, though interesting to begin with, came with a self destruct mechanism incorporated.",negative
"I really need to recommend this show to more people because it's vastly underrated. The story and plot are so interesting, but it's really everything underneath that make this show what it is. The characters are written phenomenally and the actors play them so well. They're very dynamic, all with their own hidden motives, and you're never quite on the same page as any of the characters. You never know how a situation will play out because there are so many factors and moving parts constantly affecting a single scene. The way they deal with and display mental illness is extremely interesting and it adds a sense of distrust to whether what you're seeing is real, fake, or figurative, constantly keeping you on edge and skeptical. The directing and cinematography are absolutely outstanding, they completely throw out the rule of thirds and it works so well for the show, opting for shots with lots of empty space over the characters, an obvious display of how small insignificant they are. The entire presentation makes it feel much more cinematic compared to most even lit gross generic television looks. The show is much darker and more realistic than most television, and you realize very quickly that the situation of the show is larger than any of the characters could have imagined, and that no character is ever truly safe. It's clever, it's unforgiving, and just a genuinely fun ride, making scenes filled with hacking highly captivating rather than cheesy.",positive
"From depicting hacking close to real world, to depicting multiple personalities and the battle between the evil and good side of the mind. And the quotes which elliot says makes this series so amazing.
It's a phenomenal show. Perfection.
Can't say more
Watch it",positive
"I love the pilot episode, it's really good 60 minutes. I wonder if the next episode also will play in 60 minutes per episode.The first scene already give the idea to the audience that this could be awesome series, it feels so original too.The cinematography is candy in the eyes. Well, that's plus.The story is original and quite unique. The writing is good, like they know how real hacker works, not only they hack in computer, but there is also AFK, and stalking works for the hacker to do. many movies make hacker looks super awesome that they can hack anything only by sitting their ass in front of laptop, it is just so unrealistic, not with this show.I like the main character. I kinda hate the scene where he cried because he is lonely thou. But It's alright. Overall this is amazing new show with original ideas, good writing, acting, and beautiful cinematography. Totally gonna follow this serial TV.",positive
But it did lost it's point over the time and it did became more political -but not in a bad way it was still interesting... (yes it was ver focused from the start)i'd higly suggest you'll watch the first 2-3 seasones and if yo like them the 3'/4'th,negative
"So, not having much of a knowledge about this show or not having much anticipation, I just watched the show and now I'm glad I did.So many cool things for me in this show. Well for starters,1) A hacker story 2) A lonely character with a computer (sounds like me) 3) A vigilante (Well, that alone is enough for me to watch it for years) 4) Spoiled society (Screw it)As a huge fan of Person of Interest, I'd say I've fallen in love with this show. (Yeah yeah, the pilot)The story, acting, screen play and the casting are so good. The show kept me on edge from the starting. One great pilot and I'm so glad I watched. Looking forward for next ep.",positive
I don't even know what to say. It's just so  amazing.,positive
"Some of us know what you're trying to do, show. We know you're just a high production-value show with arrogant artsy cinematography.They portray the perfect hero for today's young adults, he has social anxiety, doesn't care for money, is a junkie, has sex, meets the other dystopian heroes in a cool abandoned arcade, hates people but at the same is white knighting the good fight against big bad evil capitalism... in other words, a SJW.I think they hired people who understand how these TV shows work, so everything is meant to be appealing, from the plot and characters to the camera shots and flashbacks, but nothing is original, it's just a trendy device with no real identity to make people think ""this show looks good, like those other shows and films"".The same crappy devices used to make ""Life of Pi"".Oh and... when they were mocking that over-the-top hacking movie to try and make them look like ~real hackers~ in contrast... oh man, that was pathetic and laughable.",negative
"What a boring, overrated, horrible show oh my god, i tortured myself watching this thinking it would get better... it never does! This show is boring AF, the plot (if it even exists) is so messy and full of fillers, the photography is so exotic, ugly even, the acting is good but there is no quality beyond that I don't recommend that you waste so much time on a show as overrated as this one!",negative
"I'm at episode 10 right now...I thought i'll never see a great modern show again... This is just freekin perfect. The story is consistent, the acting is above average, Rami Malek is just great as a depressive schizophrenic, supporting roles are not just some meaningless figures - they actually have significant depth and meaning. I love the camera movement, and the fact that the main figures are often not in the center of the frame causing some extra work of the brain to get the frame and the story in balance - so when you watch the show, even when you watch it without thinking, it still makes your brain active in a additional level to the usual operational level.The music is great. My God, the last 5 min of the 9th episode - i watched it 5 times, it is one of the best 5 min i've seen in the last decade of watching television.Moments of Swedish language...i mean, that's just a small thing in the whole show but those few lines in that language just adds some freekin mystery to the whole story. I would kiss the guy who said: hey, why not let them speak Swedish. I don't care what the reason was but it's a genius move if you ask me.No sexual aggressiveness, no unnecessary violence, no meaningless dialogs, no cheap tricks at all.Subtle and brilliant. Already a classic. Love it! Love it! Love it!Good work the whole crew.",positive
This is a show that makes me believe perfection does exist,positive
"Just loving it.. as a linux admin myself..in the first season I mostly paused the telly to see what they typed in the terminal screen. Well I wasn't disappointed at all, actually quite funny and well done. My compliments to the makers.
I also really like Rami Malek.. what a great actor!
This is finally quality TV my brains will accept amongst all that trash out there for the braindead jumping sheeple people. I will not rate it a 10, because 10 stands for perfection and nothing out if the hands of humans is perfect. You feel me bruv?",positive
"Get ready for a bumpy ride in the seat next to the 1/3 of the screen for the whole series. the key scenes are all shot in 1/3 rule and it was kind of ""different"". story had it's boring and kill me! moments all over the episodes but this was a unique show. too bad it is ended.",positive
"I can't really explain how big of a masterpiece it is. Nowadays, even best of the best tv shows lacks something, but mr robot is an exception, a perfection. Each episode with great direction, sound, acting.. i can keep on going. Rami malek, really shines with it. The show is based around the real truth. World is run by secret group of people who don't have any good thought for us common folks, i wish you good luck friends!",positive
"I cannot believe some of the bad reviews I have read on here. What are you people thinking? I have to question what, if any television show do these people deem worthy. Everyone wants to compare it to The Matrix or Dexter or Fight club. It is it's own entity. We can easily trace The Matrix from Equilibrium and so on and so forth but regardless this is good TV. Do not read reviews from people that cannot make it through one episode. There are turns and twists here. Give something a chance before you rip it up. In a time when mindless reality television is ruling the airways, here is something that is not only thought provoking but relevant and entertaining. That is hard to come by these days. Sure it takes from this and that...BUT SO DOES EVERYTHING CREATIVE! This is one of the best things I have seen on TV in a while. I would like to know from those who gave this bad reviews? Just what are you watching that is good right now? If this is so bad, what exactly do you find good?",positive
"I love all seasons, the best TV series i have seen. music/character/scene/story/actor so on. every E like one excellent film. more than these, soul contact i get. and i almost cried at last.
top 1% of top 1% go to hell MF. we are together.",positive
"Loved the first 2 seasons. Writing was innovative and acting believable. Malik's performance was impressive, top notch. I was also impressed on how the storyline changed with each obstacle that the characters faced. In season 3, the writers decided to get more political, which is a major turn off to me. The end of season 3 had some interesting developments, so I was excited for season 4. Not sure what happened, but it was like a light switch went off - either they had new writers or the directors decided to turn this series into a soap opera. Acting was over dramatic, characters were suddenly not behaving like themselves, and the storylines that came at you were predictable and unbelievable. For the first 2 seasons, I give it a 9/10, season 3 a 6/10 and season 4 a 4/10. Average it out and I give it a 7/10.",positive
"I'm gonna try and make this simple but there are so many good points about this show. The cinematography is super awesome, the minimal details that can be so important and they always pass by on the first watch, the great casting, the plot, the message, and so on. This gives a whole new view of mental illnesses and addictions than normal shows give. I started looking at the world in a different way, a better way. Sending love to all the persons envolved in the creation of this masterpiece, and a special thanks to Sam Esmail for not disappointing anyone.",positive
"This is the best series that has ever been created!
From Sam Esmail intriguing visual production, to Ramy's incredible performance throughout. To the interlinked plot!
It was just a rollercoaster, with the episode in season 4 episode 7, being quite literally the best episode I have ever watched in my life.
It's a ten, it's a modern day classic!",positive
"The writers got an AWARD for this!? The only source I can imagine is the Blind and Deaf Association of America. Watching this show is like watching paint dry in slow motion. Lots of nerds who threaten other nerds to do bad things to them in ""secret"" chatrooms. Lots of ""clever"" monologues that could just as well have been written by an angry 15-year-old. Some psychiatric disorder the main protagonist treats with psychoanalysis and morphine. Some sort of ""deep"" underlying ""drama"" that brings absolutely nothing to the story. Lots of drug use for no particular reason. And a plastic cherry on top of this wooden cake - the exhumed Christian Slayter. It would make a nice script for a community college cinematography class home assignment, but this was made for television!!! An intolerable mix of plots from lots of good movies (sorry, Fight Club) jumbled together into a yellow snowball. Not worth the effort of pushing buttons on your remote.",negative
Nothing even comes close to the brilliance of this masterpiece. That's all you need to know.,positive
"Season 4 is pure perfection. The entire series is thought provoking and unique, but I have never before watched a show end in such a satisfying and beautiful way. Still floored. About to rewatch the entire series...",positive
"The teasers on USA got me to look into this. The free first episode on Amazon was a good idea. I watched it and I was hooked. Very intelligent, thought provoking and entertaining. The main character is intriguing mostly for his faults. This looks like it's shaping up to be a season-long story, rather than episodic, which is the best way to tell the tale. I don't know if the Christian Slater character will add or detract from the story (even though he's the title character). His success rate with TV shows is abysmal, but he might work out as a supporting character. I hope the 'techno-babble' is kept to a minimum. If it's accurate it's usually boring, and if it's wrong it invites a chorus of ""Oh no you didn't!"" from the nerd crowd. You can talk about technology without getting into the hardware.",positive
"My quick rating - 9,0/10. Well, season 1 is over and all I can say is ""incredible"" I haven't been so enthralled in a show since the first season of 24. The story is so utterly original that cliffhanger week by week is an understatement. There really isn't a fan of anything from action,romance, thriller down to computer geeks that isn't touched upon with this show. (sorry, there weren't any zombies). The acting was near superb in a very frenetic role that Rami Malek tackled with ease. Christian Slater also returns which is a good thing. I have always been a fan and he id a nice job here. I have to be vague, and rate the whole first season in a brief summary. I will give you the IMDb sum up here so you needn't look it up. My advice is watch it, and then come join FSOCIETY.",positive
"How can this show only have a 8.5 rating? I guess some people were turned of by the style of the show.Without any doubt one of the greatest shows of all time.Great from beginning to end.I will just go over all of the aspects:Cinematography: 10/10 some of the most stylised, special and creative things I have ever seen. There is no other show that looks even remotly like Mr. Robot. Combined with the editing its just next level. A stroke of genius. And probably the most impressive one-take episode in television history.Plot: 10/10 just perfect. The plottwist, charackters, foreshadowing, buildup, pacing, overall plot, villains, motivations, themes. Everything is perfectActing: 10/10 everyone puts in amazing performances but the obvious standouts are Elliot and Mr Robot. They are phenomenal, some of the best acting ever.Soundtrack: 8,5/10 not bad or anything, pretty great actually. Extremly fitting for the story and create the perfect athmosphere. Still nothing above a 8,5 for me personally (very subjective)This Show and Breaking Bad are the GOATs of live action TV shows imo. Nothing comes close to their level of plot and acting. Game of Thrones was also there, but unfortunatly the last 2 seasons happend.",positive
"It still expertly treads the line between being intentionally cryptic & genuinely intriguing, without becoming too pretentious, and it's still unlike anything else I have seen, especially the way it bravely ties the story in to current world events by incorporating actual clips of Trump speeches and news clips etc to do so.Total thumbs-up from me and deserves a lot more attention than it seems to get at the moment, maybe as it's still not available on many networks or services yet. In some ways reminds me a bit of the X-Files, but with actual purpose and pay-offs for all the conspiratorial plot lines it introduces. Brilliant atmospheric music tops it all off too, and it still has the most authentic portrayal of use of computers / hacking etc that I've ever seen on screen. The producers really go to great lengths in that dept. Also think that V For Vendetta fans should check it out",positive
"Wow, what an epic journey, definitely one of my fav TV shows ever, what a beginning and what an end, just brillient. thank you all for making this happen.",positive
"Take Dexter, Person of Interest, Scorpion, a touch of Hannibal, and whirl them up in a blender. What do you get? You get Mr. Robot.I must be forthright in that I am a professional I.T. person. So the technology we see here is something I am familiar with. I don't know that it makes a difference to most viewers whether it is accurate or not, but I can't help but judge a bit on ""exactness,"" although that might not be entirely fair. The pilot was nothing but impressive in this regard, although it bugged me that Angela didn't know what a rootkit was. But I am mindful that it somehow had to be explained to the audience, and that was one way to do it.The main character, Elliot Alderson, is like a lot of brilliant people I know. A lot of people I work with every day. After two episodes while they don't really formally diagnose him (unless I missed it), it is pretty clear that our I.T. dude is on the spectrum. He's also a drug user (if not an addict). Morphine seems to be his drug of choice. So he's smart but flawed, and very, very adorable with his big, shiny eyes, feral movements, and quirky smile. I empathize with his life. He's both lonely and alone, and it makes him cry. He has a fish named QWERTY, who he seems to be able to keep alive, so all is not lost with him. He does have social interactions with people who seem to care about him. And he cares about them. This is important because in a show like this you have to have at least one likable character, in contrast to shows like Suits (also filmed in NYC), where all the characters are abysmal if not hateful (or worse yet, shows like Graceland where you want to throw something at your TV). Elliot is likable, and it seems other characters are as well (for example, his clueless boss Gideon who in the pilot has a hysterically funny ""coming out"" scene).So after two episodes I like this show, mainly because the writing is very clever, the music is good (the 2nd movement of Beethoven's seventh is used beautifully), and visually there is some very neat stuff going on. I really like that sometimes what we're watching shifts into unreality (one of my favorite tropes). The pilot is fantastic. The second episode a little less so in that it seemed slower, not so mind-blowing, and far less brilliant. But these are early days.Mr. Robot is strongly derivative, and that's why I didn't give it a ten. As I said at the beginning, we've got Dexter (there's a voice-over, Elliot is a vigilante and keeps mementos of his ""virtual kills""), we've got PoI (conspiracy theories abound; there's an adorable dog), and Scorpion (do I even need to say it?). Maybe we can even throw Hannibal in there with Elliot's hallucinations - we don't necessarily know what it real and what isn't. Could it be possible that Mr. Robot himself is a figment of Elliot's imagination?I keep wondering if the derivative-ness is like an inside joke... you know, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, ""Say no more."" We'll see if the show breaks free of this and starts being more original. I'd like that. But I like it pretty much as it is, too. Dexter, PoI, Hannibal are all favorite shows of mine.",negative
One of the best series of all time!!! Amazing actors and plot. Especially the last season blows your mind!!!,positive
"Sam esmail is definitely a genius, he had everything in mind from the beginning. What a season finale! Rami Malek is transcending the role, just fantastic!",negative
The final season of this series is really good. The plot in every episode. the direction and choreography is really a masterpiece.,positive
"No comments.

hello to everyone from Russia",positive
"The show doesn't deliver on it's promise to continue to stretch the mind beyond a few episodes into the first season. As an audience member, I feel myself bent over backward only by the constant desire for the writers to finally show me who Mr. Robot really is. Is 2015 America this braindead enough not to realize it for themselves? Has the Western Diet of fast-food, bread and very little iodine caused permanent brain fog?",negative
"Vigilante uberhacker Elliot (Rami Malek) takes on ruthless mutinational Evil Corp - who killed his father - while suffering from mental illness and morphine addiction.You know what Mr. Robot is? It's old-school science fiction, the kind that ends up with familiar streets full of people with placards, and anarchy going on, in order to make a point about human society in general. In this show, the alien invaders are the good guys, and they're the dark network of computer hackers.On a human level, the Mr. Robot series asks the question, 'Why would anyone write computer viruses?' and the answer for Elliot is twofold, and it isn't 'money': one, it's to get revenge on the multinational that gave his father leukemia and two, to be a nice guy doing bad things because the rest of the world are 'pr*cks' and they deserve it, as his father taught him.SPOILER: the character of 'Mr. Robot' played by Christian Slater is actually Elliot's dead father, in a twist from 'Fight Club' among others (Sixth Sense even), but unlike those, this isn't a major plot point. This is more the depiction of Elliot's illness from his own point of view, and it works. There is a lot of it, btw.Why the Breaking Bad reference? There are similarities in the hero trying to be the baddest SOB in the valley, and the whole drug'n'prison dealing-with-the-devil shtick and the well-maintained suspense. There's even a 'Bonfire Of The Vanities' subplot.Not perfect - for example the way Vera, the badass drug dealer simply skips off into nowhere is a bit weak (though he may return in series 2?); a quick glance at the 'hated it' reviews will, of course, destroy the authenticity of the hacking techniques, and the gay and bondage sex scenes are a little bit gratuitous in the way of 1980's soft pr0n videos, but if you enjoyed the subtexts of Breaking Bad and the like, Mr Robot will satisfy that hunger.",positive
"By Von dela CruzImagine The Matrix's Neo before taking the red pill, Tyler Durden's ensuing empathy towards quasi existentialism in Fight Club, throw in a subtle mix of Renton's battle with addiction in Trainspotting and Joe Goldberg's gripping narration in You and you got yourself one of the best TV series that you can get your hands on in The Robot. This show is insistent in confronting stereotype tech movies such as swordfish and The Net and unintentionally making censurable similar uninspiring tv pieces (such as Dexter and Scorpion) for wrongful depiction of how a true technology based show should sound and feel like. Apparently, while The Robot is full of technical jargons, the well written script makes the hackers vernacular easy to understand. Ramek Malik's character Elliot (a computer genius) who's caught in a dilemna to understand the human psyche by trying to figure out the bounderies of right and wrong as he singlehandedly takes down the largest capitalist conglomerate in the world is charming, psychotic and poetic in every sense of the word. His narration is a litany of wit and condescension which I found admirable. In fact, I wont be surprised if you end up taking down quotes every so often. I did. Lol! Binge watch this. You have no choice. Mr Robot will reel you in and keep you glued to your couch for hours.",positive
"Mr. Robot is an incredible and amazing show, is so epic and so accuring to this times
It became my second favorite show ever and you have to watch it",positive
"I like almost every aspect of this movie...the screenplay, acting, the way is filmed, the music chosen according to every action, the fact that is very coherent with reality in every way. Just excellent.
The only aspect that bothers me is the aggressiveness and assiduousness in explicitly showing gay/lesbian kissing (close filming, full framing).
It is not relevant for the movie in general, does not affect the whole action and I think is just not a necessary addition.",positive
I finished this show 2 years ago and started watching it again!This is how much I love this show it's absolutely amazing ( it has the best ending ever) i highly recommend this one to anyone (+16 ) to watchEnjoy !!!,positive
"Mr. Robot is a mix of Marxism and nihilism. The characters are dumb, envious, self-destructive and anti-social. Rich people are depicted as psychopaths (literally all of them) whose only purpose in life is to kill, pillage and rape. Corporations are evil and must be destroyed. And computer programmers are a bunch of sjw-tumblr types. They are irrational drug-addicts who can't be bothered to conform to social norms, but have magically acquired super-human knowledge about anything technology related. All that is missing is an appearance from Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately the writers have chosen message over content. Every episode so far has been a disappointment. From the technical perspective the show is pathetically inaccurate, but this is the last of its problems. For people who are interested in dramas in the technology world, I recommend ""Halt and catch fire"". It's one hundred times better.",negative
"So this show is very slow at times and that might put people off. I however really enjoyed it! Loved the hacking and elliot! Season 1, 3 and 4 were my favourites! Especially the finale of season 4. At first I weren't sure about the ending, but then it all came together really well. Sad too, but happy! Loved the show!",positive
"Awesome and promising beginning of the series, but after just a few episodes turns into psychological/psychotic drama without making much sense. I continued to watch hoping for something making sense and becoming more engaging again, but the show just never delivered.",negative
"(THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE FIRST SEASON)""Mr. Robot"" is a very well written show dripping with intelligence and great performances.I really want to talk about Rami Malek: wow. Just wow. I'd never really heard of him before now. All I really knew about him was that he was the Pharaoh in the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. But he is such a good lead in this show, due to his complex character. He plays Elliot, a schizophrenic, anti-social, and drug-addicted man who acts as a hacking vigilante. His off-kilter performance really gives this character even more complexity, and it absolutely works.His introduction in the very first episode is one of my favorite scenes in the entire season. In this scene, he confronts the owner of a coffee chain of providing people with something illegal (just watch this part; it's great). What's so great about this is how well the dialogue is written, as well as the suspense and Malik's performance.Another thing about this show that really intrigued me was its portrayal of hacking. Many shows and movies tend to have unrealistic notions of hacking (a character even makes a joke about this). This show has a very good understanding of hacking, and makes it much more complicated than other shows do (hence the realism).My only criticism with the show is some of the plot twists. Some of them kind of push the boundaries of realism, and some of them are just a bit excessive. However, most of them are really good and hard-hitting, so this is only a minor criticism.Overall, Mr. Robot is a fantastic show, and I highly recommend it.",positive
"Yes, Mr. Robot deserves a 10.Does it have plot holes? Inexplicable events? Discrepancies? Is it pretentious?Heck yes.But hey, the way the story develop, the realistic worlds are constructed and reconstructed, how the characters change over and over, the settings, production design, soundtrack, editing... amazing, amazing.I dare to say a show can achieve this level of excellence when the show runner has not only courage to develop sensitive social themes and the technical understanding + skills to deliver incredible shots (I'm a sucker for those long one single shots, just love them). But: there's a clear understanding of the overall arc of the story. And yes, you can see it.. act 1 (S1), act 2 (S2,S3), act 3 (S4) .Ah.. each season is glorious in itself.Love the easter eggs, love the risk Sam Esmail took in opening S2 (like it or not), love the subplots and the way it forces to think about your mental health. Love Rami Malek and Christian Slater, amazing acting. LOVE the cinematography and the weird camera angles.Maybe love it, cause I watch it when I moved to NYC.It might be the only show that is worth a rewatch BECAUSE you'll have a different experience!Suggestions: avoid reviews, too easy to spoiler the whole thing. Do not binge watch. Watch it alone.",positive
This show is so good but season 2 is borning. Enjoy in this show.,positive
Every single season is great and really couldn't stop watching the last 4 or 5 episodes of season 4. Must watch and really great work done by Rami Malek and other respected Cast and Crew and of course Sir Sam Esmail.,positive
"Excellence is the one word to describe what this show is in general.I still don't know/can't realize how much this show means to me.. Its been only 6 episode so far and I just can't wait for new one very time it ends(and boy am I gonna be sad when a season is over and I have to wait for +100 days for another one :X (No..Noo..NOOOOOO))Everything from acting to storytelling is great(hell, even camera work stands out from other shows). I've never been this impatient for a protagonist to talk to me, way he engages you in his work telling you to start thinking of solutions because you're in this mess with him..I LOVE IT!RECOMMENDED for everyone to at least give it a try because it deserves it!",positive
"Firstly, I don't understand the big issue with people being disappointed because they think this is a rip-off of other movies/series. Honestly, I love American Psycho, found Dexter entertaining and I liked Fight Club enough (not to the point of idiotic worshiping it is submitted to, but OK), along with other sources which Mr. Robot could have taken from, and that doesn't make me hate. Besides, while I was watching, not even once I had the feeling of witnessing something already made. Of course, there're people ready to jump at anything. I'm sure I could find similitudes between ANY series and previous movies/series, if that's what I wanted, but it'd be ridiculous to point out those and start shouting ""rip-off!!"" For Pete's sake, they even compare this to The Matrix... really, now... It's like you throw in a computer and a corrupt power and we have a Wachowski rip-off, right? I guess the real world must be The Matrix indeed... No mention of the cyberpunk material The Matrix ""rippef-off"", for example. But, hey, give the masses a big title and that's all they can focus on, everything else, no matter how far apart, is a rip-off. Even if I took it the same way those haters do and saw Mr. Robot as a rip-off, I still see a lot of potential and brilliance on its own. But, of course, that's hard to put in the mind of fanatics and maniacs... Hey! Why don't we include Anonymous, Sega, Dell, Isaac Asimov and Czech etymology in the ""rip-off of"" department, as well? Disgusted by this series??? C'mon, get a grip.Moving along, after gaining the enmity of a few thousands...Even though the series is filled with little, flashy mistakes that not even a non-techie, security aware person would commit (Elliot's laptop system, used for hacking, is named Elliot? Accessing root with real names/surnames, really???), and other flawed content, like why the heck revolutionaries of any type would support big corporations by buying and smoking cigarettes, this series is, by far, the best approach I've seen to the real deal. It is dark, without the idiotic ""man-look-how-cool-i-am"" characters found everywhere nowadays. It is bold in its approach to reality, by even naming real people as ""evil"" (I LOVED the iphone comment in the first episode). The use of symbols, names and organizations close to reality makes a smile come to my face. I personally believe that Christian Slater's character is bad written, or maybe it is a bad choice for an actor, or both, I don't know. Rami Malek, I find him refreshing, bringing moments which connected with my own life in many ways. It is a bit bad to see less screen time with him in it as we reach the end of season 1, although it is true that the rest of the cast do a good job, generally. The drugs issue is, perhaps, an unnecessary extra which takes away part of the relevance of hacking itself. That said, it makes the series interesting, nevertheless, and I think it should be up there with other mature series like Breaking Bad. Oh, and nice to have a bit of an independent vibe in this multimillion dollar industry. Pity about the censorship. Fortunately, after some searching, it is possible to find uncensored versions floating around. Oh, and by the way, the correct name for Tool's album is AENIMA ;)",positive
Simply a MASTERPIECE. One of the best TV shows ever created. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼,positive
"I have enjoyed Mr Robot for the most part, I think Remi Malek is superbly well cast as the main protagonist Elliot Alderson, he does such a good job of making the socially inadequate nerdy computer hacker come to life.The secondary characters are also very excellent indeed and can hold the show perfectly well on their own, as they have done in at least one episode where Elliot hardly appears.I would have given Mr Robot 9 out of 10 if it were not so much in debt to the Fight Club movie. I could easily accept taking the main character narrative style from Fight Club, that is not unique to Fight club, but the fact that Mr Robot takes other very significant elements from Fight club is disappointing.I've watched series one and two and I will watch series three when it comes out. Aside from my complaint about the debt to Fight Club, Mr Robot does contain much originality of its own which is why I give it a 7 out of 10.",positive
"Mr. Robot had potential but character lost my interest and sympathy. And how swiftly after the SCOTUS LGBT marriage law that Mr. Robot quickly injects a vivid Gay Men love scene and S&M scene. It is apparent Hollywood wants us to believe the LGBT population is 50% of our nation, when its 3- 4% with many recent polls. Just sick of TV bombarding my family with these LGBT lifestyle's as popular and natural, when neither is true. Not to mention the drug addiction Eliot has that the show dwells on each week. I'm losing interest quickly and finding it getting harder to endure each episode as they air. I'll bet Mr. Robot now will follow Sense8 and really push the LGBT love stories, maybe having Eliot get severely drugged up and sleep with Tyrell just to be shocking and risqué.",negative
"Great acting, story and camera work. the only downside, it slows waaaaay down from time to time. apart from that, there are plenty of well developed characters to keep the show on its feet.7/10: really good, but has some pacing issues",positive
Ok. Season 2. It is like watching a 17 year old doing improv after having read Crime & Punishment and paying for it.,negative
I can comfortably say this is one of the best TV shows I have watched. The constant twists and turns in the story kept me on edge the whole way though. Everything about this was a 10/10. A true masterpiece.,positive
"Mr Robot: an excellent show and very modern at conveying the feelings of the current times. Elliot, a computer specialist, has vowed to change our depressing society by his own means and to bring a conglomerate down. Meanwhile, the young potential Tyrell is aiming for the CTO position of that exact corporation. Throughout the show, its cinematography is superb. It has strong moments of original dialogue in the first season. Along with a decent plot where you question everything. Over time, it provides a solid depiction on common hacking techniques. Yet, the portrayal of characters is stereotypical. Not even mentioning that at times it feels more of homage to 'Fight Club', 'Trainspotting', 'Death Note', 'Anonymous', and 'The Matrix', than its own standalone show. Overall, entertaining to watch and it definitely has its moments. Ps. To understand the meaning, it is essential to complete the season (especially for season 2). Once you past the first 2 episodes, finish it first, before writing a review. Pss. The subtext is spot on: of course climate change is real. The 'wealth gap' is at an all-time high, especially for those aged younger than 40 (just look up home ownership % and student debt). Youth unemployment is at an all-time high. And even IF you are in a 'wanted' work field, you're still hopeless since income from work is only gonna give you so much.",positive
"The last season did it for me here. Every other season was impeccable in its own way. The second season was a bit boring for me as it was usually the same routine for Elliot and not too much happened. The 3rd and 4th season was the best for me. Especially the 4th one. The way that Sam Esmail wrote this show, and last season, was amazing. You could tell he put his heart and soul into this show and that's what all good writers should do. He focused incredibly on mental health in this show and I really related to Elliot's social anxiety. I get incredibly nervous being around new people and I get nervous about getting any jobs. However, after watching this show, I've come to realize that I'm not the only one in this world with those issues and it's made me me feel heard and not alone. The ending of this series has also made me feel like I have the strength to move past my insecurities and weaknesses just like elliot did. So thank you to the cast and crew of this show for making me, and many others feel like they're not alone and for helping people understand the danger and power the top 1% of people have in our world and that we are not our flaws",positive
"I love the premise for this show. The main character Elliot almost even seems to speak for me at times. Also, I am a fan of Christian Slater's work from the 1980s and early 1990s. So this show has a large potential for me. However, although I think Mr. Robot is basically well accomplished, its average review rating on IMDb makes me compare it to other shows with IMDb average review ratings near to it. And unfortunately, so far, I don't think Mr. Robot builds suspense quite as well as shows like Breaking Bad or True Detective have, nor is the over all performance of Mr. Robot's acting as high, and its scripts are not quite as strong.Mr. Robot is indeed a good show, but maybe its being done a slight disservice by some overzealous viewers. I think amateur reviewers have a tendency to overrate when they particularly enjoy the theme behind a particular movie or television show. Additionally, I think sometimes even professional reviewers will take a populist view and rate movies and television shows just based on whether they think most people will enjoy such rather than rate such according to what they feel are the actual technical and artistic merits of the piece in question. That all seems to be the case with Mr. Robot. So instead of being able to just write about how I enjoy Mr. Robot and to what extent here, I'm almost forced to say that although Mr. Robot is good, it is slightly overrated, and that is unfortunate.Of course, all is not said and done with Mr. Robot. This show is only six episodes into its first season. I predict that it could, ultimately, deserve a rating in the neighborhood of 9/10, and by ""neighborhood,"" I mean a very strong 8/10, say an 8.8 or an 8.9. However, at the moment, I have it at about an 8.3 or 8.4 of ten, so I'm rounding to the nearest whole number in my rating and giving it eight stars. Every TV show that I've tried which was rated by other viewers at below 8.2/10 has eventually felt like a waste of time to me. So, my actual rating of 8.35/10 stands for a a bit above average or pretty good.",positive
"I've been a software engineer for 30 years so based on the premise, I was looking forward to seeing Mr Robot. However after watching the first episode I've seen enough.Our Hero Elliot is a paranoid neurotic drug addict who likes to hack into people's personal lives for fun.. Of course Elliot is a misunderstood genius who can't fit into corporate America or life in general. Predictably all successful or wealthy people in the show are both stupid and evil and must be punished. It's so cliché it's almost comical.So along comes Mr Robot who wants desperately to enlist Elliott into his band of misfit hackers called (I'm not making this up) ""FSociety"". FSociety's goal is to Hack Evil Corp's banking division and in true Robin Hood fashion, erase all credit card debt owed to Evil Corp. This would in effect transfer kabillions of dollars in wealth from the evil corrupt baby killing coprporate monsters to the poor innocents with too much credit card debt .Mr Robot is essentially a progressive liberal socialist propaganda video. Unfortunately Hollywood is pumping out a ton of this stuff lately. For me it's getting old.",negative
"I didn't think it would be possible for me to have a new TV show that topped breaking bad, but here it is.It's a show you can watch for the first time completely, and then watch it again with a whole new perspective. How we didn't see the final twist coming I don't know, some people worked parts of it out, but looking back it's so blatantly obvious once you know the truth.About to rewatch from the start.",positive
"I'll start with the good things: it accurately talks about cyber security, it has pretty okay drama, and pretty okay characterization. The actors do their best in playing the roles they've been given. Tyrell Wellick, who is basically Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, is enjoyable to watch.That's it.I've only seen the first season so far, because I enjoy seeing realistic hacking. I might continue watching for that reason, but I don't look forward to it.The bad things: the main character is a shallow know-it-all. I enjoy dark and gritty shows, I enjoy conspiracy thrillers, but this show's obvious attempt to look deep comes across as conceited and self-indulgent. The creator himself admitted he just steals from classic movies like Fight Club and The Matrix to write the show. All that Elliot does is make dumb choices because he's not mental issues and takes a lot of morphine. Even if they made him better, the outcome of Season 1 leaves a lot to be desired. Season 2 (no spoilers) has him preaching Voltaire, ""I don't need God as my scapegoat"", as if he's better than most people. He sits in therapy and all he ever thinks about is how he's better than 99% of the sheeple who buy so much stuff from the corporations, and how he's so stressed at how they're what's normal that he's alone.The main villains, E(vil) Corp, are made out to be so cartoonishly over-the-top evil, you can't really see it as something from the real world.They also preach a lot of Marxist ideas, like why they hate capitalism, debt, social media, food with GMOs, etc. It's preachy because they just say it outright, and then end the conversation there.This show...is not for anyone who wants originality. It's not for anyone who wants to see characters make choices that make sense. When the supporting cast is shown, they're mostly boring. His hot friend does do stuff herself, and that led to great character change. She was a good side story. She was the only one in the show who made good choices.And I say that knowing full well about Elliot and his team's desire to clear out all debt from the citizens. The problem with them hitting the reset button on debt actually would result in them helping the corporations that had a lot of debt. Corporations have debt more than anyone. Citizens will be readily royally screwed by them in a matter of months.Overall, this is a cartoon with no sense of humor, a lot of unnecessary edge, and a main protagonist -albeit smart- is so brain dead it makes him unwatchable. History will reference this as a show that's good at referencing the better movies it stole from.",negative
It's the most thrilling and amazing and is way in which connection between characters is shown is really onsane,positive
"If you like Sam Esmail or Rami malek worked on Mr. Robot ... I thank you very much! thank you! Only Mr. Robot could stun me in this way, with his contemporaneity so real that it bordered on the surreal. I hope it will be considered to take the complete script of this masterpiece and turn it into a book. Season 1, 2, 3, and 4 were of unmatched respect for the plot. it was so well tied over 4 seasons. all done flawlessly!",positive
"More than I expected, then the principal caracter is so dark and so mess up that is difficult watching, I got bored on the season 2 and I don't want to see it any more, the sister, the father, the friends everything is so complicated and things happen so slow that is not for me.",negative
"Nice work by the main actor! Some wonderfully weird scenes. Among my favourites are those where an unlikely character suddenly starts to philosophise about the meaning of life, or shares his innermost feelings with Elliot while obliquely suggesting a rape-at-gunpoint agenda. Nice scene!I'm sure a couple of the people working on the show had good ideas and were burning. The off-angle shots mostly work for me. Although those beautiful static, symmetrical images go missing after a few episodes. A number of aspects of the main character's condition, sort of high-functioning autism, are represented in an imaginative, metaphorically true style. The morphine habit is completely plausible. If you prefer the main character to be a typical middle-class admirer of computers and technology (clueless), film yourself. Watch it with friends.By the way, there's no contradiction in Elliot not wanting to engage in uncalled-for touching and his having sex. Sex requires contact, you want it, fine.That said, someone remarked that there are only a handful of stories in existence, so it's just natural that Mr Robot should borrow from other films. But this conclusion is not entirely certain.Those archetypical ""stories"" are types of psychological dynamics, aspects of the human condition that appear again and again in drama. They've got to.On the other hand there are an infinite number of ways in which to recount and visualise those stories. Make them interesting and psychologically compelling. It's lazy to conceive your project as a succession of pieces from every other successful show and film of the past 20 years. Small chance to function, and it doesn't.In the end I couldn't be bothered much anymore to follow, skipped through the last two or three episodes.The producers seem to think it's necessary to spell out every little twist and turn to their obtuse viewers. Guess it's called maximising the audience.""They probably won't get it at once that the two of them are the same person."" ""Yea, right, make sure to loop that clip of surveillance vid where he falls from the balustrade ten times so they understand."" ""We need some controversial sex."" ""Two blokes."" ""Two girls!"" ""Let's do both."" ""Don't forget to put a prop in the way of the action."" ""Remember that cool scene/storyline from Sopranos/Trainspotting/Fight Club/Breaking Bad/(name your favourite) ...?"" ""Throw it in."" Mr Robot is lazily done, not just the big stuff, also details.Music and sound selection are, well, lazy. Character's supposed to be happy? Make it a waltz. ""And we need more of more dramatic sounds. Will make everything, like, more dramatic.""If characters in the film would say ""fuck"" as often as people actually do in real life the whole show would be a beep fest.A nerd like Elliot who has phones that swipe open. Any average nerd. Doesn't happen.E Corp being a big company won't do. It's gotta be ""the most powerful conglomerate in the history of the planet"". ""Slip that line in at least once per episode."" Did I mention the music? Could have been a great show. Ends up as a me-too.",negative
Worth watching. Hard to put away once you get into the series. Filled with plausible scenarios that you actually can imagine could happen. Also a big plus for the plausible hacking. So many ditectors make hacking look like an old arcane game.,positive
"I don't know anything about computers or hacking. But this is smart writing. Every episode has drawn me in. I agree, the 1% of the 1% should be exposed and burned. But I have yet to see the ""Other side"" the evil side. With enough training and money, I'd probably fight Mr Robot and the good guys. Cause in the end, we are all just numbers and as of 6/1/2020 there are to many rabbits in the garden. I'm willing to go. But if I'm here, I'd rather rid those who cause the surface damage and let those who rule RULE. hahahahaha. This is a good show.",positive
"**** SPOILERS *****The good: I loved season 1 and had high hopes for this TV series before season 2 came around. I instantly loved Elliot Alderson's character and how his monologues explain how people really are in society but no one ever talks about and he strips away the bullshit. The command line ""hacking"" is a small bonus and wish there was more of it to add the effect of realism.The bad: Season 2. It's fast pace and will confuse a lot of people. Season 2 took a quick dark turn which made me lose interest in the show. The things and character development that I enjoyed in season 1 are not on season 2.The ugly: I find that Darlene's character is annoying and I don't know if it's the actress or if the character was created to be this way. Gideon's ending was swift. Elliot's character in season 2 is dark and hacking isn't involved that much and he doesn't talk much. Darlene is taking stupid risks which doesn't make sense from a hacking lifestyle perspective.This show has the potential to be more than great but it'll most likely end up with a ridiculous Dexter'ish ending or. I doubt that the writers have a master plan - season 2 is like spaghetti code, especially with character development. I have not decided if I'll go past episode 4.",positive
This is a masterpiece. It's so underrated and misunderstood. I love the cast and his dedication. 10/10.,positive
"I have seen the first three episodes of this series, and if feels like ten. That's not necessarily a good thing - but in the case of Mr. Robot - it is!The pilot episode had almost too much crammed into it. I watched it in parts over a few days, and was amazed to realize that it clocked in at only about an hour. Had I not bothered to find that out, I likely would have guessed at least twice that.The character of Elliot is superb, and played very well by Rami Malik. His is a dark soul that hides a basic goodness that the viewer can almost touch. I think many people can identify with that darkness. His narration, spoken in a kind of deadpan, broken manner, sometimes verge on the poetic.Of course, in our reality there is no corporation called Evil Corp. And though not every corporation IS evil, clearly there are at least a few that are. It's never by design - things just turn out that way.Besides Elliot, there are other interesting, reasonably realistic character populating the series. As in the real world, almost all are damaged in some way.I can only hope that the quality of the series extends beyond the episodes I have seen so far. It's not an easy thing to accomplish, and very few such series have done it.",positive
"Mr. Robot goes under the crime, drama, thriller categories in imdb, but it must be one of the very few thriller shows that are not really story-focused. The show does have an OK story presented in a not entirely linear way, but I feel that the key to Mr. Robot's success is that it reflects on some of the concepts that characterise the zeitgeist of the 2010s really well. And of course these concepts are presented in an exaggerated way, but that makes for good suspense and laughs.Basically all characters are hopelessly lonely (the only somewhat functional relationship is between two borderline psychopaths who do not act like a classical couple anyway), and they compensate for it by getting involved in some pet projects. Elliot, a hacker genius, wants to save the world, and his friends, whom he convinces to join him on his quest, also feel that things should be changed. But, as it is fairly common in the 2010s, nobody knows what should be done, and no matter what genius plans they come up with, and end up carrying out, they just make things worse. So the show is basically about the confrontation between the OK guys, who want to make things better for everyone (but end up making things worse), and the bad guys, who want to make things better for themselves (and end up making things worse for others). Concepts like crony capitalism, and top 1% of the 1%, and widening income gap, and consumption fetish, and big brother are all part of the show, but it only scratches them on the surface (very wisely they avoid the trap of getting into the details and making university lectures on these topics).Acting is good, the characters' motivations are fairly clear and convincing, the actions taken by them are not illogical, and so the whole story develops in a semi-credible way. It is a really good watch; makes you think and raise questions, but does not want to feed you with cheap answers.",positive
Words can't how explain how much i love this show and the impact it had on me. Please watch it if you can.,positive
"I got caught up with the hype and decided to view this series. I was hooked after the superb opening ten minutes. However, the series didn't live up to these first ten minutes. The editing was irregular, too fast at times and too slow at others. I also felt that there were too many unexplained threads, it felt like reading the middle of a book without knowing what's come before. The reveal in episode 9 was too obvious and we'd already caught onto it by the end of the second episode and sure by the third episode. Also the big hack that the series finale was leading up to is not shown and we're just left seeing the aftermath, that was an absolute let down. I hope the second season is a little more clear and better edited.",negative
"Just everything about this show is amazing. So gritty, so dark, the writing and direction was perfect and the acting really kept you on the line. So many twists and turns, it will keep you hooked.The ending as well, so satisfying!Thankyou for this show.",positive
"The hype is real--this show is terrific. The characters are complex and engaging, the cinematography is groundbreaking, the writing is brilliant--USA Network really hit it out of the park with ""Mr. Robot."" The biggest critique of the series is that it's a blatant rip-off of ""Fight Club"" mixed in with ""American Psycho."" Ignore the noise. Is there truly any idea that hasn't been done before? (The correct answer is no).See, the thing is, I tend to not be a fan of dramatic television. It's not to say that there aren't a lot of good drama programming out there, because that's definitely untrue (I loved ""Daredevil"" and ""Jessica Jones."") But I work in entertainment and I find so many of the critically acclaimed dramas like House of Cards to not only be slow and excruciatingly boring, but also full of characters that I can't identify with. Don't get me wrong, ""Mr. Robot"" is a bit of a slow burn but the characters are so interesting that it doesn't matter.In terms of the quality of each season (there's only two so far), season one is basically as good as TV gets. Every episode is gripping, and aside from a minor side story, and not one felt like a filler episode. As terrifying as the Wellicks are, they are my favorite characters on this show. Season two takes a bit of time to find it's footing but definitely goes out with a bang. It also has a different feel to the season as it focuses on an intense psychological journey with Elliot and Mr. Robot. And big season two bonus is that we find out just how perfect Joanna is for Tyrell.If you have Amazon Prime and you aren't watching ""Mr. Robot,"" get off IMDb immediately and start it!",positive
One of the under appreciated performances and characters was from Michael Cristofer who plays Phillip Price (CEO of Evil Corp). Just amazingAmazing show all in all (just finished season 2),negative
"Is that bad that you can spoil a TV show by just stating it's VERY similar to a movie? The writing is pretty good. The characters are interesting and quirky. But it's VERY similar to Fight Club. Spoilers for those who haven't seen Fight Club, there's no Tyler. Edward just has split personalities, and his plan is to destroy all records of credit card debt. Mr Robot does the same thing. That's the gist of the show. However, I wanted to address the main character's view on Religion. His view is that religion was created to ""divide us"" and to ""make us easier to control"". The second part is somewhat true, but religion's purpose was not to divide. Quite the opposite. The fact that there are so many different religions is what divides us. Religion's primary purpose was to unite, to instill morals, and to scare people to conforming to laws. For example, ""Thou Shall not Kill"" or some variation is found in nearly all religions. Eternal Torment is a pretty common deterrent in most religions as well. Mr Robot is very wrong about why religion exists.",positive
"Am going to put it out there from the start I hate find annoying all tv shows that insist on playing pop music randomly in scenes specially when the music is loud not only is it IMO unnecessary and adds nothing to the scenes it is annoyingly distracting at times to the point I have started to play subtitles to enable me to hit the mute button on my tv and avoid said music!
Mr Robert has a lot of this ,don't get me wrong I understand the need for background music which at times fits in perfectly with scenes just STOP with the pop music please!It took a while for me to understand Mr Robot and I am not referring to the fact he has split personality but the back and forth in time of scenes that at times caused confusion as I tried working out where we were in the story?I can not fault the acting which was superb by all however I do feel the show could have been condensed as at times it was slow and seemed repetative .An average show didn't rock my socks",positive
"It's rare not to feel taken for a fool in a fiction. This one is sharp, sensitive, educated. When complexity is usually brought by stupid flash-backs, numerous characters or false leads, here it is only relying on an enlightened perspective on our world. The narrative flowing uncluttered in almost real time is highly subjective due to the main character's sweet voice-over. This paradoxical role is played with complexity, sensitivity and talent. I've noticed that guy a while ago, and I think I've found one of my favorite actors. He is antithesis of the usual hero with a static and stereotyped acting. He is capable of infinitesimal facial expressions that allow him to embody fragile characters with great realism and finesse. I love you Rami! By the way, I'm a computer security expert, and the technical references are quite accurate. I was surprised as realistic computer security is not so sexy. Usually we see people tracked by their GPS or other non-senses. I'm not rating it 10, otherwise, what would I do when it gets better?",positive
"Never in my life have I watched something as thought-provoking, climactic, and just down right marvelous as Mr. Robot. I've watched a lot of TV, but this is in a league of its own. There is literally nothing else like it.Each season is as good as the last, and as a set it's a masterpiece.I now have an insight that I never thought possible, I'll never think the same way again. Words cannot portray what sitting down for the 45 hours of Mr. Robot will do to you, but you won't regret it.",positive
"I was psyched about mr. robot when it started......then it took years between seasons to get an update.

"After watching a lot of TV shows, I thought I finished all that is good to watch. I watched BB, GOT, House, The Wire, The Sopranos, Peaky Blinders, Suits, House of Cards and a ton of other great TV shows. After finishing Mad Men, 2 years passed and I did not find any TV shows worth watching like the TV shows previously mentioned.My friend kept recommending Mr. Robot, but I was not very interested. I thought I should give it a try, and I am glad I did. This show got me hooked from episode one. The first season was just perfect in my opinion. The twist in season one was a little predictable, that mr. robot was just an imaginary friend of Elliot. However, it was very well done. Elliot saying to us: "" This is happening, isn't? You knew all along, didn't you?"" was what made it better. I think we were meant to know ( or at least predict ) that mr. was not real.Season 2 was the weakest of them, but still was a good watch. Elliot taking down the villain in season 2 was a great scene. The reveal of Elliot being in a prison , but he didn't want tell us because he didn't trust us after what happened in season one, was a really good twist.Season 3 Episode 5 was one of the best episodes of all time. The way it was shot, one long shot, was another great touch from Sam Esmail. I don't think we will ever see an episode of TV like that.However, all these great things in the first three seasons would not have made me write this review. It was seaso 4 that really elevated the quality of the show. It was like what season five of breaking bad has done to the show. I can safely say that season 4 of Mr. Robot is in the same level with season 5 of Breaking Bad. The very first scene of season 4 was a big shock. The way Price was waking towards the camera and taking off his wire, and seeing people of the dark army walking towards Angela and killing her coldly. What a way it was to kill off a key character. I consider episode 7 of season 4 is one of top five ( or maybe three ) episodes in TV history. The reveal of Elliot's past was heartbreaking. I never felt so sad for a TV character like the way I felt for Elliot. Rami malik's performance was top notch, I don't know why he did not win an Emmy for that performance.Finally we come to the ending of Mr. Robot. The final episode of Mr. Robot might be the best final I have ever seen in a TV show. The reveal of our Elliot not being the real Elliot was just crazy, but it makes perfect sense. I don't know how we didn't see that coming. But that is the brilliance of storytelling. The clues were there for us all along, but never for a second thought of it.Mr Robot will go down as one of the best TV shows in history. I hate that this show is not appreciated enough. It deserves a better rating. 8.5? really? La Casa De Papel has the same rating???? More people should appreciate this masterpiece. We might not see a good show like Mr. Robot in a very, very long time.",positive
"Season 1 of this show was great. I am not sure what happened in season 2 but the show is not worth watching; a total waste of recording space on the DVR. It's a hot mess and, but for the residual merit of season 1, I'd say it must be canceled. The show is so bad and so confounded that the series now appears to include additional airings of cast, writers, whomever, just trying to explain each episode and, I presume, -thereby retain some viewers. Well, I have no interest in a show that requires absurd levels of explanation to make any sense. The plot is broken and, despite the fast paced, let's call it twitchy presentation of each episode, the story line move at a snails pace. All the nauseating repetition of a daytime soap yet completely lacking in any wit or such other potentially redeeming quality. It the writers were shooting for schizoid embolism, then they scored a bulls eye.",negative
"I know very little about computers and nothing at all about hacking them, but, the concept of this series is great and in a class all buy itself...a computer vigilante who targets white-collar criminals and other bad people by using their own personal information against them!?!? Good!Until seeing this, I thought that all hackers did were rotten things like stealing information and money, sending viruses, and, hurting innocent people for personal gain. This guy is doing mankind a service by hurting those who hurt the innocent. Once again, Good!For a computer inept like myself, this series is also somewhat explaining how and why computer protection companies, and, law enforcement agencies, always seem to be one or more steps behind the people (hackers/criminals) they're paid to catch and shut down. Job security! If all hackers were suddenly stopped, as with all other criminals, terrorists, etc., a lot of people, such as those in the FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and, even local police departments, would no longer be needed and be put out of their jobs, as would those in the court system, alarm companies, and, everyone else all the way down to the makers of simple pad locks and dead bolts. This will never be allowed by the powers that be. That's why this guy, Elliot Alderson, would have to be looked upon by law enforcement people as a criminal. Not necessarily because he is, but, because he makes them look incompetent and dysfunctional; but, John Q. Citizen sees him as a vigilante - a hero who's doing what law enforcement cannot or will not do.I like this series. Elliot Alderson is much like a Charles Bronson (""Death Wish"") vigilante of the internet! :)",positive
"To the credit of the writers of the show, it's nice to finally see something that actually sort of rings true from a technological point of view. The tools the characters use, the dialogues concerning the hacking, it all isn't annoying if you are in the business yourself. Obviously they made mistakes here and there and took the liberty to add BS stuff for dramatization, but I found it refreshing to see they actually made the effort to display hacking in a way that remotely resembles the actual act of hacking.That being said it's such a shame that they didn't took the effort into looking into the real people that are attracted by the type of work that hacking brings with it. Somewhere along the 3rd and 4th episode everybody involved appears to be suffering from borderline personality disorder, having some dark secret or perverted sexual preferences or all of the above.After hiring hackers for more than 15 years I can say with some confidence that this isn't representative for the hacker community as a whole. I think these characters tell you more about the guild of screenwriters than anything else.",negative

"All four seasons were very enjoyable and unique. Great soundtrack and cinematography.Many say season 2 is the least enjoyable and is apparently also the point where some stop watching. This show can be slow but if you watch attentive it pays off. I'd say you would definitely get hooked after watching halfway through of season 2.I personally felt the show just gradually got better from season 1 out. Unlike most shows I'm still thinking about this one after having watched the finale. I think the biggest accomplishment is that, despite an unreliable narrator, the story and all its weird quirks still made sense at the end without being unbelievable.",positive
Mr Robot is just an insane look into schizophrenia and also into hacking and revenge. The plot jsut gets more and more intense as seasons go along.Rami Malek is perfect formhis role and sucks you in to the part.Mr Robot is a one of a kind show.,positive
"Memento, Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, Jacobs Ladder, Leaving Las Vegas were each brilliant movies that tapped into hallucinatory art in a brilliant way that complimented and reinforced their stories.Sadly too many shows these days try to throw drug hallucinations at the audience as a cheap substitute mystery, intrigue, suspense and originality. And that is where I found Me Robot sadly.I thought the premise of the show was fantastic, the acting very good by some and decent for others.... The first handful of episodes very intriguing.But the convaluted hallucinations that really start to shift to the central point of the story wreak havoc in the latter part of season 1. And they just continue to detail and fail to add up and it gets worse in season 2 .. there are just too many story holes left unaddressed. The show tries to carry a hitchcock style of thriller suspense, but unlike hitchcock movies paying close attention to every detail waiting for the master to make sense of it all.... Mr Robot doesn't... It just leaves loose ends everywhere and in it's attempt to explain itself as it goes along it just leaves too much collateral damage for viewers with an eye for realism and detail....I read this show suffered allot of viewer patience fatigue and I learned first hand why.Great premise, solid acting, great story concept choked out by excessive hallucination nonsense that doesn't at all play well or realistically in this show considering the brain power needed by these elite hackers....Ps I'm a software engineer and while some of the technical material and tactics here were more realistic than most shows, the characters playing the elite hackers just weren't anything close to reality.",negative
"Mr. Robot's debut episode flows so smoothly that you don't realize an hour has passed. Interesting characters that are already fully developed, including the lead who brings out your inner geek, make this show incredibly interesting and enjoyable to watch. Being a life long Neil Diamond fan, I was especially surprised and enthralled to hear ""If You Go Away"" begin playing as a back drop to the lead character's walk to his destiny. All the while the viewer is contemplating what his decision will be. You can see and begin to understand his thought and decision processes. I highly recommend this show. The best I have seen on television for quite a while.",positive

"I only made it half way through the second episode of the first season and it took all I could to suspend disbelief enough to get that far. I can't believe that this show gets as many positive reviews as it does. It's like a movie made for 12 year olds, if that. Are people so divorced from reality or are they so hungry for a geek fantasy that they will put up with this type of farce? The way that corporations are displayed and how upper management acts and how employees relate to each other is all off the chart silly. The idea that some IT guy can bring down the world or that there is some Coney Island stealth group working to do that is just dumb. The plot that some young, mentally ill, drug addict IT guy is so smart and valuable the biggest corporation will do anything to get him to work for them is laughable. The ridiculous things are endless like the cheating husband's dog being taken by Eliot, having the caring drug dealer neighbor, having girls naked left and right wanting Eliot with no effort on his part, having a client trying to save his therapist in her personal life, that 11 lawyers who did nothing were at some meeting with the big wig of E Corp and Eliot and then ordered to walk out as if they were some props which they were, that Eliot the world's greatest hacker sits around snorting morphine and not injecting it, that Eliot is a world class genius everyone wants, the scene where the DDOS attack occurred was hokey, just about every single Eliot hacking scene is not believable, the E Corp guys riding around like the secret service. On and on and on. The show is a cartoon and completely divorced from real life at every level (relationships, hacking, corporations, IT departments, morality, drugs, white collar workers, the WHOLE PLOT, etc.). Watching Marvel or Bugs Bunny is more realistic than this garbage.",negative
"Just take V For Vendetta, Fight Club, and the anime Durarara (which is excellent and you should consider watching) and mash em up together PERFECTLY, not some desperate attempt at unoriginal ideas, rather, creating a SUPER idea from all these previous ideas. AMAZING! Everything about it is amazing.The main character (Elliot) has depression, social anxiety, and lots of mental fun stuff. He is the main reason I love the show. His character, which is filled with bad and negative stuff, tries to do good and save everyone. He is also surprisingly creative and brave, despite his ""mental handicaps"". The story telling & the , sort of, subplots really reminds me of Durarara. There isn't REALLY any subplot, just lots of MAIN PLOTS that overlap each other. But unlike Durarara, the main plots overlap each other because of the main character. I'll quote from the show... ""one constant in a sea of variables"". The story telling is superb. Well, not exactly story telling... Elliot ""narrates"" us with a little speech in the beginning of each episode, and every time it's amazing. It gets me hooked up for the rest.The other characters are also really good, and they get better and better as the show goes on.HYPE HYPE HYPE",positive

"The series seemed like a real winner at first, giving you the illusion of elite hackers but then it starts stumbling upon itself, giving so much confusion that it became uninteresting.It's to serious and bleak at all times with everyone staring slightly off screen mumbling we started making fun of it. Random jokes said during the show to keep sanity, such as ""btw I use arch"" after a really depressing scene or rattling off a terminal command during a long stare. Does he even use qubes with whonix though? sudo yum install dramatic. It's probably the only reason we've lasted this long.So, is that guy real or not? The show doesn't seem to make sense either way. It goes into the ""always losing"" scenario, combined with the confusion it just isn't fun to watch anymore. First season was pretty cool, not everything is terrible.",negative

"I forget which season it was, but Elliot was basically creating an ""alternate"" reality to help himself deal with the harsh reality he was facing. Ok, I can forgive that, being as the show started out so well, but OH MY GOD the last 2 episodes just suck so hard it ruined any enjoyment I ever had watching this. As far as I can count, he had 5 alternate personalities, not including the real him. We, the audience, was one of those personalities, but we were passive the whole time. The real Elliot did not appear in any episode, or at least one that I can remember. The ""mastermind"" fought for control of Elliot the whole last two episodes, which were like an LSD trip, before finally giving control back to the real Elliot, but we never get to meet him. It ends with all the personalities fading into darkness in a movie theater, so we don't know if Elliot died or whatever. On top of all that, I had only one question I wanted answered, and guess what, no explanation of any kind was given. We have no idea what it was that White Rose was building. I hate this show. I hate this show.",negative
"This show starts out very interesting, with having a seemingly corrupt hacker using his skill set to do good in the world. After a couple episodes the show divulges into the mental illness plot which adds flavor and makes for a nice revelation towards the end of season one. Most technicalities and computer things shown are actually very well researched and accurately presented, something which I did not at all expect. So far so good, if they left it at that I'd have rated the show a solid 8 or 9.However they decide to repeat the entire plot for season two, just in a different setting. The same setup, same confusion, same revelation, just disappointing. After episode one of season three, which seems to be set right on track for another season of pointless mind games, I have lost almost all motivation to continue with the series.Hacking has become a side dish, doing good in the world has completely left the premises. The show has deteriorated into the main character running around like a headless chicken doing damage control against his alter ego in some kind of absurd and bizarre Jekyll & Hyde clone.Do yourself a favor and stop after season one.",negative
"Mr. Robot's masterful first three seasons proved the series was on its way to being one of the greatest TV shows of all time. But in its disparate and underwhelming final chapter, it traded incisive sociopolitical commentary and effective storytelling for convenient plotting and unsatisfying conclusions. The show had never been more straightforward yet tedious than in its fourth season, which had a reliably strong grip on character development and innovative production; but its increasingly disjointed plot threads never amounted to anything meaningful relative to the brilliant and groundbreaking work from the first three seasons.",positive
"I initially expected this show would be like the Big Bang Theory where they portray intelligent people as what stupid think smart people act like. But I was blown away right from the beginning, the characters, writing, soundtrack, and story are amazing. While I think that the 3rd season isn't as good as the first two, It was still very enjoyable. I especially like the characterization of mental illness, a topic that is constantly misrepresented in the media.One last note, I am very amused by the dementia-riddled boomers who are foaming at the mouth and giving this 1 star because of ""mugh leftist/Marxist/librulism"". If you think that the universally incorrigible fact that corporations have amassed massive amounts of power in recent decades and have used this power to influence elections, sell dangerous products, ship jobs overseas, stagnate wages, bribe politicians, and hide environmental disasters, is ""leftist propaganda"" then you are either mentally handicapped or are completely emasculated after consuming processed foods for years.

"I'm highly subjective, but how could you truly appreciate art if not highly subjective..From the mid-late 2015, I'm with Mr.Robot, i never felt this about tv-show, and i was crazy about shows like Breaking Bad, because they are truly masterpieces.
But Mr.Robot has something very special, that connects with you very deeply, that i never experienced before with any show or movie.
From the perfectly chosen soundtracks, to subtle homages, to so well suited dialogues, to amazingly accurate hacking. Sam Esmail is one of a kind director, you can feel that this show is really close to his heart, he planned/knew how it end from very beginning. Its most likely going to be his Magnum Opus.
Rami(Elliot) performance is right there with Bryans Wolter. One of the best i've watched in any form of cinema, especially last season.
And about last season, which alone worth to watch first 3, just to experience last one, it could be a best season ever in television. And best psychological thriller tv show.
A truly masterpiece of cinema.Thank you friend for all these years.",positive
"I don't get all the high ratings for this show.I decided to give it ago because of all the 10 star ratings, unfortunately duped again.The first episode kept my interest, promised something fresh and with potential.From there it went downhill. Malek plays a one dimensional character expressed only through his monotonous inner thoughts which gets irritating after a while.( I can see exactly where Billions got there idea for the Mason character. Almost an exact replica)I found the pace slow, banal with a lot of stuff going nowhere. Too many silly but convenient coincidences to drive the story.I can't distinguish between the junkie girlfriend and the hacker female, both look and act identically. There is no back story to distinguish them.Christian Slater's character is pointless, he even looks like he's only there for the paycheck. His character is also boring and adds nothing. One minute he's supposed to be a psychopath the next minute he's acting as a carer and mentor.The entire buildup to the break-in at the high security storage facility was wasted since they never actually showed him doing the deed.The dream and trip sequences go on for too long and are also boring adding nothing to the plot.Flashbacks to his mother and his mistreatment by her and the story of his father's death by EvilCorp is supposed to move us but quite frankly i could care less about that sob story.Then we have the Wellick character at EvilCorp who acts as though he's the villain in a superhero movie. Although he is probably the most interesting character of the lot.Going to be a slog to make it to the end of season 1.How this got approved for 4 seasons is beyond me.",negative

Bit weird.So, I watched both them and have given it = 2/10 Yet another inflated score bumped up no doubt by the cast and editing staff.Yes just 2, what a weak drawn out mess in the 2 episodes. I must admit the first one virtually drew me in.. the second though..No A semi believable storyline with endless drawn-out side plots. Tedious in the extreme. Hate to say actors are weak and I am not one myself but.Why has this really got a score of 9.4? Honestly.?",negative
"This show star really strong but went south really fast. After the first season, it became unwatchable and one of the worst and pointless shows of all time. It's sad because Rami Malek and Christian Slater did an awesome job but the story is so boring and pointless that even their great performance cannot save this horrible show. I stop watching after the second season because I don't see any reason to continue to watch this.",negative
"I was told to watch this due to it being quite quirky and dark, even the reviews (8.5 a while ago) built this up to be something amazing.First episode in and yes it' quirky and yes it could be quite dark, however the character Mr. Robot played by Christian Slater was OBVIOUS from the very start that he was not real and just a manifestation of his own mind, which I found quite annoying.As the series progressed the slow paced story was very grinding. I like a slow burner as they can really pull the viewer in to the world, but this is just poorly paced in almost every scene.This combined with the fact that almost EVERY scene and filming technique has been stolen from so many different films is depressing. The story is about bringing down the financial institutions to reset everything to zero - sound familiar? The main character has a friend manifested from his own imagination - sounding more familiar? - The main character narrates through the series about the story and his own personal thoughts - yes you've guessed it - Fight Club in a series!It is filmed in dark lighting with bleak colours almost verging on a pale sepia, just as Fight Club was. It also pulls from Existenz, 24 and The Matrix to name but a few.It's difficult to understand why something so unoriginal and poorly paced can have such a good rating. Maybe Hollywood and the public are looking for a hero in the proliferation of badly scripted and poorly produced series on the TV just now.",negative
"Admit it now, you have private conversations with an invisible audience. When you compose your thoughts in your mind, you imagine someone listening to your unspoken words and responds to them with an intimate understanding of their meaning. You offer observations, insights, and explanations which serve as rationalizations of your perspective. You may even imagine silent nods of approval, or perhaps questioning glances of dubious thoughts but you persist in this activity because it helps to find clarity within a mind rife with chaotic thoughts that struggle to establish an arrangement of peaceful order and empower your future actions.Elliot is such a character who engages in this manner with you as a viewer and whose obvious genius is expressed within the arcane world of computer programming and the obtusely revered field of hacking. His skills are demonstrated within the plot as being far superior to most of his colleagues but also in such a stratospheric realm that he is recruited by an elite group of dissident hackers to perform a function vital to their socially disruptive goals.What has been emerging within the world of entertainment as a stereotype of genius is an accompanying lack of social skills. Doctor House is perhaps the first most successful example of someone possessing an advanced degree of expertise within their field yet being completely inept in their interactions with others in social settings. Doctor Temperance Brennan of ""Bones"" is another example of such disparity between academic genius and social ineptitude. Each of them is an exceptionally capable and uniquely engaging individual offering viewers an opportunity to both admire their talents and sympathize with their shortcomings. Elliot is the same in this regard but stands apart as a truly unique individual in a manner which emphasizes the nature of such a unique breed of human.Rami Malek delivers his role with convincing aplomb in a manner which implies his own uniqueness as a being whose profession happens to be an actor. He embodies the role with such naturally awkward grace that I believe he truly does have difficulties connecting with people in real life. Of course, such a well constructed character is formed from far more than acting chops and it is here where the writers deliver their punches.This story told through the eyes of a misfit is a treat for every thinking human being who questions the rationale of a society burning in turmoil over the many forms of inequity existing in our world today. Especially pleasing to someone such as myself who has become acquainted enough with the world of computer technology to recognize with painful awareness how rare deep insight exists within the world of entertainment fiction which does justice to its representation. The writers have done their homework here. Few outside the world of computer technology could identify what Linux is or what it represents, but the writers go deeper than making a vague reference to a geek's choice of operating system and identify its various flavours in passing conversation. I don't recall any other piece of television or movie entertainment which delves deep enough to identify a relevancy such as a "".dat"" file, but the writers here do so in a way which does not alienate a neophyte with obtuse references and instead adds layers of credible dimension to their storytelling.To my delight as a socially conscious artist, the depth does not end at computer technology but enters deep into the realm of social commentary in a manner which is both insightful and entertaining critique. It is lush with subtle imagery which makes one question whether the company referred to as ""Evil Corp"" is the actual name of the company or just an extension of the perceptions of the main character of Elliot. Within every scene witnessed through his eyes is a subtle overlay of his perceptions of a world he struggles to inhabit with some degree of normalcy. His drug addiction is measured in precise doses to ensure maximum control over it instead of allowing it to rule his existence.Although Elliot serves as the story centerpiece, the series is titled after not an actual character, but of a badge worn on the disguise of a uniform worn by Christian Slater who performs in the role of antagonistic recruiter for an underground cause of socioeconomic disruption targeting the major client of Eliot's employer. Christian demonstrates both comfort and joy in a role suited to what I imagine his personality to be like in real life. The rest of the cast of characters has been treated with detail which hints of future developments. Each has been constructed with attention to the subtle details of personality, intelligence, and character hinting at interesting developments to bubble up in future episodes.This series is unfortunately being delivered painfully in weekly releases when each episode would be better watched back to back in an extended binge session. Nevertheless, it comprises one of my few weekly must watch programs which excite me on the day of each new episode release. The richness of story depth, the subtlety of scene detail, the intelligence of social critique, the insightful exposition upon the human condition, the nuance of character, and the implications of an unfolding conspiracy which promises to surprise as it unravels keeps me glued to a weekly schedule. Although only four episodes have been released thus far, it is a series which easily captured my attention within the first episode and which has offered a degree of entertainment that promises to keep me glued until what I expect will be a satisfying and likely gripping season finale.",positive
"I was fooled by some media article that said that this show had realistic technology for a change, but actually, the technology is just the same bullshit but with real software screenshots instead of purely made up, and from realism point of view is not much better than 24 was.The plot started off in some kind of direction and then just went off into character development of the uninteresting and unlikable characters.Seems as if each episode was written from scratch with no specific end point on the horizon. Remember when writers had an idea about what the story was about before they started writing ?I swore I wouldn't watch season 2 after the dismal season 1, but here I am on episode 3 of season 2, and I just finally have to switch it off. I don't think anyone touched a computer so far, Tyrell the most interesting character has vanished, and some of the other interesting actors have been replaced by far more annoying people.How this garbage made it to season 3 is beyond me.

"For some reason Media has always had it for science and technology, regardless the fact that they rely on it on every stupid thing they produce, just like the rest of the religious community take on the same subjects. On almost every episode, tech savvy audience find it difficult to stomach the amount of rubbish being displayed as computer stuff.This is so awful it makes you sick, unless of course you are a technophobe or someone with no understanding of technology what so ever, then it may see like something to watch and fill time with. To avoid spoilers here are some pointers you may want to check: first of all computer hackers don't wear hoodies to avoid being spotted, that is simply lame and patronising beyond anything I have come across. Second, Tor browsing wouldn't allow another hacker to see the stuff you are checking on the internet unless you are using it wrong. there are so many similar errors that it is hard to say they were unintentional. In addition the way hackers are wrongly portrayed as psychologically unstable persons, though they are or think they are much smarter than other people. As well as the idea that hackers waste their time hacking individuals to gain knowledge of their histories and habits is so lame.I have no issues with Sci-Fi series or movies, to the contrary I love them, but when they attack the basics of science and technology I stand back and point out the misconceptions they are trying to sell.",negative
"I tried to stick with this past the ludicrous casting (female ""characters"" in particular) but I've had to throw the towel in just recently.I'm a software developer of some years myself and even I can't follow what the plot here is supposed to be - there appears to be basically no narrative arc or anything else to hold my interest at all.What really throws this though is the utterly ludicrous female characters - these are supposed to be heavy techies or FBI agents etc and none of them look like they've eaten a solid meal in six months!Add in the equally comical ""United Nations"" casting of the original hacking group members and I, literally, held my hand to my mouth to stifle my laughter at times ... I didn't spot a left-handed, one- legged scuba diving transsexual in that group but there must have been one somewhere!If there are any female ""hackers"" out there in the real world, I can promise you they're going to be a size 16 instead of a size 0!Quite how anyone involved with this production could think that wheeling out one skull-faced girl after another, in what's supposed to be an underground and highly skilled environment, was appropriate or believable in any way, shape or form I do not know.If these girls were playing junkies then OK, I get it - emaciation etc is right on the money but otherwise, what the hell is wrong with them??Sorry to see Christian Slater cameoing in this by the way - he deserves better but I can't blame him for the writing or the casting.Dreadful.",negative
One of the best TV Series since Breaking Bad. Mr. Robot is pure art and Sam Esmail is a genius. The way each episode was done and how they carried out the whole story was just epic. Season 4 blew my mind off.,positive
"Not bad if you can stand Malek's one note acting. I for one can't stand it. The constant surprised look with the piercing eyes and awkward timed talking, it gets old after the second sentence and it's the same no matter what he plays in. The show itself isn't bad at all, quite entertaining and keeps you watching. Well written and produced. Season one is clearly the strongest followed by season four. Seasons two and three are a bit less strong in my opinion. With a different lead actor this could have been a lot stronger, the rest of the cast is fine but nobody really stands out in their performance.",negative

"After S3 went sideways I tried to hang in there looking for the original creativity and intrigue of S1 & 2. It never bounces back. There are few carrots on a hook that never pan out, barely anything of interest, and the final tie-up is lame lame lame. So disappointing after the incredible start. I wish I could get my time back. I especially hope that if the producers plan to continue with Mr. Robot, they hire some actual shrinks to put some real foundation around the sudden and poorly constructed explanation of Elliot. It never regains any bite and plummets into a poorly researched sob story about DID. Who cares why the protagonist did what he did? What happened to the writers from S1 & 2? S3 & 4 were the biggest waste of time I've experienced in my entire streaming career.",negative
Everything about it is perfect it really changed my life i m getting emotional writing this because it s amazing mind blowing patati patata U MUST WATCH IT pls give it a 10 it deserves it😢,positive
"This show is what happens when you take a half-baked idea which should have been a movie and stretch it into 4 seasons long TV series. When you first watch the pilot and then watch the second episode, the quality difference is extremely obvious. What they should have done is that add another hour to the pilot on par with its quality and make this into a movie but instead we got this show full of plot-holes. Because plot-holes are what happens when you take a well-thought but a small idea and stretch to a point where it almost tears apart. Then cue in the nonsense plot-twists they throw around to cover those plot-holes. When I look around, all I see is people praising this show for being as realistic as possible with its hacking stuff but what those people fail to see is that hacking process is the only thing that makes sense in this show. Nothing else makes sense. Creators probably looked at DEXTER and wanted that fame but their idea wasn't fit for a long-term show.",negative
"Absolutely brilliant programme so many twist and turns , and touches on the subject of mentalRami maylek , Christian Slater outstanding performances",positive
"The first episode is like the a small movie with its only plots and twists, and an curious ending. Those are normally the traits of a good TV series.Maybe I'm biased because I felt deep connection with him. I'm a programmer, too, but I don't hack and I don't break the law, I share his view of society anyway. Some people may find his view childish and exaggerated, but I like the way the writer sharply pointed out the hypocrisy of our modern day life and the seemingly freedom in capitalism. I'm not saying I support the claims of conspiracy in the show, I'm saying I like when people are being blunt and honest, if you are like me in this regard, you'll find this show quite enjoyable(even more if you are also a computer geek).The other thing I like about this show is that other shows that involves computer technology are usually very vague on the technical side and just throws jargons around without understanding them or trying to make sense. It's exciting to see a show that engages real geeks with real things that real geeks might get excited about and at the same time enjoyable to other people who are not so tech-savvy.It's a great show for everyone, especially for those who are not ones who live in ""the reality of the naive"".",positive
"As a writer, a professional critiq, a cinephile, and a programmer, I found this show as one of the worst shows IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, it has so many bugs that I would be all night counting them, but I will mark some of them.
90% of show is about romance, drama and getting high, 9% is about scenes and characters which are totally a fill in to the story, a blond girl trying to sue I dont know what company, and a business sexy blond guy who goes from here to there without doing nothing important to the plot.The 1% left is about hacking that we actually never see or know what it is about, so, practically is a show sold as hacking but without hacking... the script is extremely dumb, bad, senseless, the actors dont have any chemistry, and there's an actual scene in SEASON 1 EP 6 that lasts like 5 minutes where nothing happens, the dude grabs his head because someone died, he tries to cry and to pretend he's sad and that's it, FOR 5 MINUTES!! it looks like a real glitch of a game, it was so annoying that I wanted to restart my tv and my pc, god, anyone who puts more than 1/10 IS A TROLL, DONT WATCH IT, WORST SHOW EVER.",negative
"Others have given a good synopsis of this wonderful first season so I will just focus on what I think makes it stand out.There is a bearing plot that follows through the season. It progresses in a perfect tempo and still lets other subplots emerge and find resolvement. In my view, pace, especially in a series, is a delicate matter. Most often a story is prolonged in absurdity but this is not the case with Elliot Alderson and his friends, family, colleges and demons. The story often takes some ""point-of-no-return"" directions which feels so refreshing and actually surprising.Elliot Alderson is a well constructed protagonist. He has his dark sides and at first I was afraid that this would follow the all to known script where the really brilliant character is portrayed with a dark and destructive side that just adds to his heroism. Elliot's dark side(s) has an actual impact on the story and is furthermore shown in a way that challenges the audience in a brilliant way in deciding Elliot's level of sanity/insanity and as a further consequence what meaning a specific situation should be given.His talent, that anything with a microchip, can become his uorganic bodily extension, is exaggerated to a certain degree but its nothing I am going to dwell upon.Rami Malek, who plays Elliot Alderson, does so in a very restrained way. He is thoughtful in such a way that you almost become concerned if he is mentally present in social situations which maybe is exactly the point. Furthermore he (inter)acts almost without any expression and I think that this is an expression of a big artistic gamble as the risk for us to be indifferent towards him.I really look forward to meeting Elliot, fsociety and Evil corp. again very soon.Regards SimonPs.

Really enjoyed it except season 4 became quite far fetched which I felt let the rest down. Apart from that it was excellent,positive
"**Spoiler Alert **I really tried to like this. But after the end of the third episode I was done. I thought from the 8.8 rating that this show might be worth watching. Boy was I wrong. I'm so sick of almost every single TV show or movie that comes out that has to incorporate some kind of sick disgusting gay story line. Why? Every aspect of that in the show was very unnecessary. I had to fast forward through it. Yuck! Just yuck!! I wonder if writers or producers of whoever approves this crap really believes that everyone wants to see that. On top of that it got really really boring by the middle of the second episode. I didn't have high expectations for this show, but I was not expecting such a sh*t show. Unless you enjoy watching gays have butt intercourse (eeewwww) or you enjoy slow paced, boring, pointless shows with no direction, stay away from this. Don't waste your time. Even if you decide you're okay with that, I'm pretty sure most people will realize by the third episode that this show is garbage.",negative
"Season 4, the last one, and the best one. It shows that the creator of Mr. Robot had amazing idea for a story from the beginning to an end. And that finale... I had tears in my eyes. It's been a while since a movie or tv show moved me emotionally so much. After watching season 4 I had to rewatch whole series. Excellent job Sam Esmail, excellent job.",positive
"I've always loved TV-shows that make me question reality - few shows has ever done that in a convincing manér. Well.. this is certainly one of them.First of all let's get this straight, I was NOT sure about the lead (Rami Malek), I had never heard of him nor seen him act.. but boy am I GLAD they chose him. I mean, this man can act!! He made me fall in love with his character in just 6 minutes. He is smart (actually very smart) but he is not perfect and that's precisely what I love about this Eliot character - he's deeply flawed and he knows it. He is feels utterly alone and suffers greatly because of it. This loneliness makes him have deep and controversial monologues with the made up person in his mind (the audience). He questions his sanity over and over again and even so he doesn't give up his resolve - that the wrong doers of this era (the 1% of the 1%, as he puts it) deserve to be put to justice.I also like the tech-y aspect the director went with, which I find very appropriate to this informational era. Eliot makes very strong arguments regarding the issues surrounding too much dependents on tech and how some people might use it in order to make a lot of money, and in some cases in VERY illegal ways. All in all, amazingly well acted TV-show with brilliant writing.",positive
"Ok the 1st season is pretty good and I was hooked! But as it goes on, the plot and the bad character development become excruciatingly tiring... Watched some movies and series with this type of ""schizo-hallucinatory character"" plot and this is by far is the worst... It sooo draggy and has many unnecessary imagery that distract us from the main plot. I don't mind a ""good"" draggy series like lucifer or breaking bad which definitely had some ""filler"" episodes... But this Mr. Robot execute it really badly that I can't stand to watch anymore of those ""Elliot's Hallucinations of Mr. Robot"". Feels like they simply try to make more episodes by adding bunch of random stuffs to fill those run-time before the reveals happen.Dropped this at the 2nd season ep 3 don't waste your time on this one..",negative
Very good performances and great story. Well done!,positive
"Honestly one of the best shows I have ever watched in my life. It is hard to find a truly dud of an episode considering how well it is written. Rami Malek was born to play this role and it is hard to envision anyone else taking his place. The darker tone of the series elevates the experience and the pacing is just great, even though episodes are 45mins in length on average, it never feels that long. Huge credit goes out to the writer and show runner Sam Esmail who did a wonderful job developing the world of Mr. Robot. If I do have any criticism is that Season 2 did have a plot which was a bit difficult to follow a times but never seemed to fully bog down the story and such. Also I wished that Tyrell Wellick was a bit more utilized in Season 2 but that is just a small gripe I have. I'm glad the show only lasted 4 seasons, short sweet and written super tightly.",positive
"The thing most TV shows suffer from is that their pilots tend to be weaker than the rest of the show. It's understandable; the pilot is supposed to introduce us to the premise of the show and its characters, so that can easily become sort of tedious. It wasn't like that with Mr. Robot. Its first scene was great; I got a perfect sense of what the show was about (hacking) and who its main character was. By the time 'Mr. Robot' flashed out, I thought to myself ""This is going to be an exciting show!""Oh, was I wrong.The thing with Mr. Robot is that it is so slow. I constantly felt like we're about to reach some destination, that something BIG was about to happen, but it never quite happened. I was in the middle of the first season and I still felt that the story had not yet quite taken off. The big revolution at the end felt lackluster. Even then I didn't feel like anything exciting was happening. That could be attributed to the fact that Mr. Robot is a more character-driven than plot-driven show, and boy, isn't Elliot a complicated character. We see a lot of the story from his point of view and most of the time he's confused AF as to what is going on around him. Actually, I've noticed that the... atmosphere of a scene is sort of clearer when Elliot isn't in it. Having said that it is obvious that Mr. Robot is not a poorly made show. It has some of the most stunning visuals when it comes to TV at the moment. For me, however, the most important aspect of a TV show is how entertaining it is and how invested it makes me to its story. Mr. Robot's story may be clever and well-written, but it is also slow and boring and that, for me, is unforgivable.",negative
"Writing after the finale. Mr Robot is a true masterpiece. It may look as a simple hacker vigilante story when in reality it's a show about our endless search for finding a connection with the others. Mr Robot offers things to think on. There is more introspection than action while maintaining the tones of a thriller. Some scenes are memorable and will stay in your heart.Season 1 starts off really good and thrilling then the show slows the pace during Season 2 to evolve in a perfect Season 3 (definetly the most fast paced and thrilling) and end in Season 4 which is a real emotional rollercoaster (a season focused on the character development). The finale is one of the best I ever seen (at the level of Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy).Best part is the introspection and the analysis of the emotions of each character. Loneliness is the main theme. Each character is unique and will be remembered. Some of the most iconic villains I've ever seen. The photography is just perfect and the direction of Sam Esmail is a solid 10/10. Happy to have seen it, a profound experience that I won't forget.",positive
"I'll remember this series for the final episode. Very nicely done.The first season, and this finale were excellent.Everything in between was a sensationalistic, convoluted, and often aggressively depressing and violent mess.I understand the focus on depression aspects when dealing with mental health, but the whole dark army, white rose plot was unnecessary. I would have preferred they tightened this to 2 seasons, focused on the multiple personality disorder, and the affects of the successful hack on the financial backbone of a nation. The whole destroying something instead of working to fix something story line which they largely abandoned to focus on white rose. The effects of E corps cover ups of polluting leading to cancer in two of the protagonists parents. These were wonderful plots and relatable stories.The trauma that lead him towards this destructive behaviour. And the ""real Elliot"" who worked to fix things by improving the world rather than tearing it down. Those were interesting themes and plot lines.The rest surrounding white rose and the dark army just felt like pandering to Hollywood tropes and detracted from the good in the show.But again, the last episodes journey was handled with deft hands, and ultimately makes the series worthwhile,.",positive
"What started as a really good crime thriller show quickly turned into a drug addict's struggle to maintain his sanity. Slow and intricate timeline along with the illusions and hallucinations take away all the interest from the show, from season 2 you can't really tell what's real and what's not. Apart from Rami Malek's acting this show doesn't offer much.",negative
"Rami Malek's performance in just 3 episodes demonstrates why he is one of the most sought after actors working today. The story is intriguing and engaging. The supporting cast is quiet good as well, apart from Christian Slater. He's, well, still Christian Slater. I know he has talent. For whatever reason it remains stunted.That's the least of the show's problems for me anyway. There is too much emphasis on tawdry relationships and activities that do little to advance the plot or story.Such elements I can appreciate in a film of 3 hours or so if, and only if they prove to be germain to the story. This was just padding. I cannot, will not sit through 4 seasons of that.",negative
"This show had so much potential, until they decided to make the main character reliant on drugs to ""function"" in society. I'm all for medical pot, but not somebody self medicating and making it seem like it's normal, when it's not at all. Opiods are an epidemic in not only the US and the UK, but throughout the entire world and to normalize it on TV is just sick and adding to the problem.",negative
"Where do I even start? This show is absolutely fantastic! Like most people I didn't expected much. I mean c'mon who could possibly imagine a show about hacking could be exciting? But dude, Mr. Robot hit me like a hurricane.I had a hard time getting into the story for the first three episodes, I didn't enjoy Rami Maleks character (and I still don't but later on that) and the topic was just not mine but the story quickly proved itself interesting and slowly built up the finale very nicely. I gave the show 8 stars after season 1. And then DAMN season 2 kicked off and got me hooked right from the start. I spend an entire Sunday binge watching and forgot to eat because I was so thrilled. The pacing was absolutely on point. Shocking twists popped up EVERYWHERE (while totally making sense) and all of the characters were able to shine.While were at it lets get to the best part of the show: the characters. Especially the females. While I'm not a fan of Rami Malek nor his character Elliot just because I find his monotone voice and his crazy eyes hard to stand, I still have to admit he's a strong lead and plays his role superb. But the real stars here are the girls. Angela is bold, Darlene is fierce, Joanna is frightening and I have no idea what the heck whiterose is but he/she/it is outstanding. My highlight though, was the addition of Dominique, I have to see how she develops further but shes a potential candidate to take my number one spot of my all time fav TV characters. Everything that happened around her this season was major thrilling and I don't want to wait another year to see Grace Gunner take this fantastic role to the next level. Bravo.All in all I highly recommend this series to basically everyone. 10/10",positive
"I started watch Mr. ROBOT solely because of its good ratings. And to my most utter dismal this is the worst highest rated show I have watched. Such high ratings. I was prepared to get bound-struck but unfortunately I was disgusted. OKAY,the mood is good, pilot was also kind of good, but as soon as the show progressed it became boring. All they show is the junkie protagonist tripping and blabbing schmatzy philosophies. And the plot holes and impossible things are a lot. The characters are not all interesting,so dull. And why so much low light dude?? The main char speaks all kinds of pretentious craps. It's the same old,same old. I have seen better with lower ratings. This was out of the blue. But different people different choices so can try it out.",negative
"You know, I just can't bring myself to give a flying Wallenda about Mr. Robot. Endless stretches of pretentious boring dialogue in a big city that appears to be mostly deserted most of the time, and a drug-addled protagonist who's a self-absorbed sociopathic asshole.I keep waiting for Bobby Ewing to poke his head out of the shower, or for the camera to pull back and show the protagonist in a straitjacket in a padded room with doctors clucking and wondering why he keeps blathering about a ""Mr. Robot"".Or perhaps the makers of the show are trying to find out just how long they can lead on and defecate on a sufficiently large audience and have them like it.﻿ Please, Ernie Fosselius, do to this show what you did to Apocalypse Now; it desperately needs it.",negative
"***This contains spoilers*** ***look away now of you don't want spoilers*** The pilot was really good. Built interesting characters with a ""requiem for a dream"" feel , but for tech geeks. The 2nd episode was OK, still seemed legit , some of the characters had broken a bit but there was still a lot to work with . 3rd episode .. seriously .. what the hell. A complete break down of rationality got me thinking if the screen writers were snarfing morphine themselves. Mr robot turns out to be such a cheese. As for the explicit explicit scenes .. my god , just why?!?! From a tech head based story into the dribble of hedonism , self loathing crap where you just not sure which character you dislike the most. There are so many holes in the story that is literally seems like the people who wrote the pilot are not working on this anymore. As for how a senior at a security tech firm gets flawed by one of the most basic hacks is completely beyond me. Are they not using all safe on their personal computers? Good enough for the the ""evil"" company but not them. What does he even do at the company?!?! Its been a long time were i have actually gotten so frustrated watching a show. I was so keen for this series as well .",negative
"Overall this show is a solid 9.0/10 with the best season being season 4.Season 1 Overall this season is a 8.6/10. Solid first season with an amazing setup and excellent payoff. The twists and turns this season were amazing. There were episodes that were meh here and there, but overall a great season.Season 2 overall this season is a 8.5/10. The first half of this season was really really slow. The pacing was bad, a lot of the story especially with the side characters was boring, and even Elliot's story was starting to get stale. The season picks up a lot in the second half and really redeemed the first half. The payoff was worth it and the journey for each character was worth the slow burn. This season is not as good as season 1. Hopefully the show gets better from here and not worse.Season 3 overall tie season is a 9.4/10. The best season of the show thus far. The acting, cinematography, soundtracks, and stakes felt much better than in the first two seasons. Elliot's character journey this season was phenomenal. From broken and hopeless, to fearless and valiant. Elliot wasn't the only character to grow tremendously as well. Angela a character I didn't care for became one of the best characters this season. Her arc was emotional.My favorite episode this season was 3x8 titled ""eps3.7_dont-delete-me.ko"". Elliot went from almost killing himself, to becoming a beacon of hope for a young boy whose sister had just been framed and murdered. That scene when Elliot starts tearing up towards the end got me. Overall an amazing season of television.Season 4 overall this season is a 9.5/10. This is definitely the best season of the show. Enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end. This was a near perfect season of television.",positive
"The best thing about the series is that it feels like they wanted to tell an amazing story and that is it. I mean they didn't streched it just because of the demand (Hello Californication!), they planned it delivered it and that is it. I think it is really rare from a series to finish this high. Nice, complete, well rounded story which was able to end when it needed to. Honestly, this my favourite series ever and if you havent finished it do it quickly -you wont regret it.",positive

"Pretentious, insipid tripe that makes me feel like a wanna-be-edgy MTV video director decided to make a show about Dawson's Creek kids who grew up (or just grew older, maybe) and learned about socialism and coding.

Outré framing can be artistic on occasion; when it consumes 92% of your show, it's just obnoxious.",negative
"I started watching this after I saw a snip on TikTok of the first few mins of the show. Half way through the first hour I turned it off couldn't decide if it was for me or if it was just boring. Gave it another shot weeks later and haven't stopped watching it. It's brilliant, clever and different. Twists and turns that you don't see coming. Hooked. Makes me think why hasn't something like this really happened or if it will happen at some point. It's definitely one I can see myself watching more than once.",positive
"I wanted to like this show. I watched the first season and loved it. Then, when I got to season 2 it started getting too messy and lost its original charm. I stopped caring about characters and the storyline was tired by that point. I think I finished the second season but didn't even watch season 3. I really just no longer cared. I gave it a 6 because I want to believe that it got better and I just missed the magic that others see. Should really be 5.",negative

While I do love plot twists, but some movies or show overkill it by introducing surprising elements on every corner to keep the audience hooked. In Mr. Robot's case, the plot twists were carefully designed and produced.From a cinematic point of view; as a video editor, I was hugely impressed. Their choice of music, the editing, the transitions, and the scenes with scenes were brilliant.Finally, Slater's voice acting never fails to impress me.

"After watching the two seasons in agonize, i feel that i need to share my view. as a software developer in cyber security i really enjoyed the references and the knowledge they presented on the show. And nowadays where cyber crime\cyber security very popular, i really enjoyed the idea of this show.It started good, single story-line with a lot around it. BUT. after a while it became too much! from a vigilante to anarchy, relationships, mental illness, history, politics, ""chinese overtake"" idea, FBI, business partners ,every group there is (arab, homosexual,blonde hair ""pretty girl"", Afro-American, young, old etc.)and the list goes on and on.sometimes more is less and less is more.so this show became so messy, with so many layers which go to DIFFERENT directions, that every episode is on another subject. ITS ALL OVER THE PLACE.and don't think that i don't like ""mindfuck""\complicated movies\shows(from death note to game of thrones).i really do. but this one tried to bring everything to the table and know i can't see my plate and what's on it.i always thought to myself, that after one season even if the show is not made so well\have it flaws - i will keep watching it because i became connected to the story. i don't believe that anymore.",negative
"Jesus Christ this show was good, every character every episode was just Great. This plays exactly like a film but I'm glad it wasn't a film because there is no film long enough that could portray how amazing this show was.But outside of format and length this is pretty much just a movie. The characters, the acting, the story, the cinematography, The Directing, even the LIGHTING and SOUND DESIGN is near perfection. I'm not a fan of political messages but this show executes them masterfully.Not to say it doesn't have other meaningful messages too, because it has many. And trying to break it down in a text review is a fools errand and a disservice.Just watch it, if I hadn't made all that clear from everything above.",positive
"I can't believe this show is just great , great music , great screenplay, great acting, great character, locationWhat I most about this TV show is that how these corporate world has come and is working as evil
The corporate world shown in show is immaculate , classy , brutal .
I didn't like the character of Darlene in it
Character of Shayla is good but I like more of Angela (Portia Doubleday) as there is so innocence in her role that is truly amazing
character of Wellick(Martn Wallström) has very appealing drift together with Joanna(Stephanie Corneliussen) having their perfect chemistry working on screen.
Mr robot(Christian Slater ) also has very unique set of things.
Rami Malek played the role at its best
But this show doesn't contain the character that will set in your mind(like Mr White form Breaking Bad)

"What if christian slater's character didn't died in the highschool explosion at the end of Heathers, or from getting shot, and after being released from prison at the end of pump up the volume? Every good highschool movie from the 1990's ends in an highschool exploding in the middle of nowhere, usa. But now christian slater is in his fifties, and still causing chaos with that sneaky smile. I seem to be flagging every instance of anarchists in pop culture and get hooked up. In the trail of anonymous, ""Mr Robot"" delivers one season of crypto anarchists making their move on a corporation nicknamed Evil CORP. There are abusive villains types coming up the corporate ladder, and reclusive good guys with a social anxiety problem, but both seem just as manipulative. In the end they're control-freaks with a lot of power. What's with television series becoming all about anticapitalism these days anyway?",negative
"I have no words to define how grateful I am to be alive and be able to watch this goddam fine masterpiece. Such awesome actors, background music, beautiful image, lovely script. This is definitely the ultimate definition of Drama storytelling. The fact that this is so so original is absurd.

Please, I another good show before I die.",positive
"Many ahead of me have mentioned how the pilot engaged them and then the series started going downhill from there. For me, the first episode got me interested and Rami Malek is a perfect casting for the role. The series is very different in many ways and is quite relevant. Malek plays an anti-hero well and who doesn't love the takedown of the 1 percenters who are enslaving the world's populace for their own greed? However, the writer/director then used the series as yet another platform to spread propaganda, degenerating into filth instead of what this form of media should be...an entertainment. Instead of giving us an escape from what we endure, the series begins to become yet another depressing mirror of reality at it's worst. There is a balance between being ""edgy"" and being just plane vulgar. Similar to how the series Bones used gratuitous gore every episode despite having fine acting and dialogue, Mr. Robot unnecessarily overuses hard drugs and pandering which IMO greatly detracts from the stellar acting and the interesting plots to take down the bad guys.",negative
"Rami Malek has made this series. The story is great (notwithstanding the not-entirely-original plot twists), but this guy is absolutely incredible in this role. There were a few (actually one -incredibly unnecessary) scenes in the first season that detracted from it and they've most likely lost viewers because of it (my wife being one of them), unfortunately. but that aside, I can't stop watching this. Rami is mesmerizing, 10/10 for him alone. I was hooked from the first episode, seriously edge-of-my-seat stuff. Hacker stuff is believable (enough - I use PuTTY/terminal), rest of the characters are excellent, can't wait for the second season!",positive
"After watching the first episode I thought this looks like it could be good, but oh dear how wrong could one be, I struggled with the mumbling dialogue, it was so hard to make it what the guy was trying to say, nonetheless I struggled on watching the boring characters waiting for something to happen, it never did, it was just so dull, it tries to be like the matrix but fails miserably, it's so dull, tedious and slow, it seems to last forever with it's ever confusing storyline of mumbo jumbo and soulless characters.Just for the torture I like to put myself through I thought to myself let's see if season 2 gets any better....oh deary me, what a mistake, it's just utter garbage, the mumbo jumbo reaches new heights, the characters are now so frikin annoying, the story is utter rubbish, the mumbling reaches a whole new level of unintelligibility, really, this should be flushed down the toilet where it belongs, it's gets on your nerves, the characters get on your nerves, the mumbo jumbo gets on your nerves, why oh why is the some much trash we get fed on TV, that's the real crime of the century.",negative

"This is the first review I've written for IMDb despite being a site user for 5+ years. The first episode of this show has promise. It wasn't great, and it wasn't perfect, but the premise of the show was interesting. Plus, who didn't love that awesome montage in the shrink's office? That was great. So we headed to episode two amidst concerns it could be getting a little too...well, mainstream media's idea of what ""edgy hackers"" are.It was downhill from episode 2 on. Basically, this show is a simplistic comic book version of The Matrix, Fight Club and what Hollywood thinks Anonymous is. It is not cool. It is not edgy. It is not geek culture, whatever that means anymore. Fight Club did a lot of this better and Hollywood considered that movie edgy 15 years ago. Hollywood. Which means it stopped being edgy before that. This show, in a nutshell, should be retitled ""How USA's Marketing Department Created a TV Show in an Attempt Exploit ""Geek"" Culture to Rake In Advertising Dollars.""SPOILER ALERTOur protagonist is packaged nicely in a wrapper that the Target Demographic can relate to: a guy who's above average in intelligence, suffers from social anxiety, feels like an outsider, and longs to change the world because he is disillusioned with the hypocrisy and greed of society. In some not very clever writing and via the use of not at all subtle plot devices, the opening scene shows basically what Hollywood imagines tech-savvy males age 18-49 want to see: themselves, only better.There are some interesting techniques used in this show, but unfortunately the show itself is frankly shallow and not very intelligent. Yes, talk of ""the man"" and socioeconomic inequality and capitalism is thrown in to make it seem smarter, in easily digestible chunks that we've all heard before. The characters are laughably unrealistic -- if you've ever spent any time in New York, you'll probably eye-roll at the overly stylized characters as well. This show is meant to be a comic book to tap into the perceived helplessness of the audience in order to get them to do two things: watch, to boost ratings, and to then do the marketing for them. What's hilarious is that this entire message of ""corporate greed must fall and we outsiders can see things normals can't"" is being created BY A CORPORATION.I can assure you (disclaimer: in my opinion) that USA Networks does not give a damn about the wealth gap. Nor do they care about big brother or corporate greed or the little guy. They're in this to make money. And why not? The target market of comic-book reading college educated Americans has a bucketful of disposable income to spend.It's always interesting to see hacker and geek culture portrayed on TV. But for the love of God, allowing a mainstream TV show to elicit emotional responses to injustice and bureaucracy is ridiculous and not a little ironic. It's tempting to play pretend and I get people wanting to believe in this show, to feel like they're a part of something, etc. But you're better and smarter than that, guys. Aren't you? Because if not, the real EVIL corp had already won. And you helped them do it.",negative
"Mr. Robot has long been one of these series I knew I would watch someday, but somehow prefered to watch once it would have been completed. Recently, I have made a marathon of each season. And even before the end of the first one, I knew Mr. Robot had become one of my favorite series ever. Now that I've watched the whole series, I think it's one of the best series ever in general.
Some episodes are altogether brilliant and show creative, technical and dramatic mastery that make many other series or film look dull or tiny in comparison.This is a story in four seasons. A very well crafted story. Once you've watched the end, the first thing you want to do is re-watch the whole series, and when you do it, you can't but agree with the intelligence of the scenarists.
It's a show that tackles not just one thematic but that is multi-faceted. It can be gripping, tense, funny, dark, cathartic... Rarely have I felt so many emotions with a TV show. Rarely have I found a character as compelling and interesting as Elliot.
But one very good advice : don't read any spoiler. Watch it in order.There is more. This series is extraordinary for its cinematography, its artistic choices, and soundtrack (bravo Mac Quayle). Some episodes are amongst the very best examples of what film and series can accomplish, ever. The series has its own style. There is beauty in it as much as inquietude... The whole creating process is excellent.The cast is utterly awesome ! There is no doubt Rami Malek is one of the greatest actors of his generation. But there is no flaw at all the brilliant cast of this series. Each scene with Christian Slater is also a pleasure. Carly Chaikin and Portia Doubleday are amazing and their talent shine in some really demanding scenes. The only problem with Martin Wallström ? We see him and this the character he plays much less than the other actors from Season 2 onwards, which is maybe the only criticism I can honestly make about the series. Stephanie Corneliussen has some great scenes, but could also have been used a bit more given her talent. Grace Gummer is splendid as Dom (some scenes where she acts alone are prodigious). B. D. Wong is perfect in his nuanced acting of an antagonist. Michael Cristofer manages to shine whatever the scene he appears in. Later in the series we discover the character played by Bobby Cannavale : fantastic performance here too, a memorable character in the vein of what we could find in ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Better Call Saul"".
There are many recurring actors that shine too in this series. Gloria Reuben is great in her role here. There is one episode in particular, near the end of the series, where I find her performance unforgettable and stellar. The same can be said about Elliot Villar even though he gets less screentime. Excellence in general characterize the casting and the secondary characters are a charming part of the show.",positive
Show is very confusing and complicated. The show is about hacking and other stuff.,negative
"Just saw Season 1. Can't describe how wrapped up I got into this. The characters, the endless twists, the music, the real ness of hacker culture and mindset. This was spot on. I'm already hooked.Not sure why people are trashing Season 2. But clearly it's done well enough to get to Season 4. Not happy about Amazon pulling an inception on viewers but giving us Seasons 1-3 on Amazon Prime but then inception the hell out of us with a Starz subscription within an Amazon Prime subscription time see Season 4. That kind of crap is a 1-star move.",positive
"During the binge-watching of Mr. Robot, I've seen House of Cards:Mr. Robot is portrayed in the modern era, where politics and CEOs are the owners of the world, where intrigue is right around the corner. Sadly, too many times this higher class is portrayed in a way that it comes embarrassedly close to Suits, just one more sad in-house production of USA Network. Cast-wise, you'll also be able to find Michael Gill, here playing Gideon, who was playing President Garret Walker in House of Cards and also Sakina Jaffrey, here playing Antana Nayar who played Linda Vasquez in Kevin Spacey's team.I was able to see Fincher:Production-wise, Mr. Robot is really good. Every once in a while you'll be given a scene that's really high-quality. The light, the ambiance and the way the surroundings give you hints about what's going to happen is pure ecstasy. Fincher was the first to handle this as a key component of production and it's presented to you all over Mr. Robot. Also, the other thing about Fincher is the following aspect.I've heard Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross:Soundtrack was bipolar. It had one beautiful side of electronic ambient songs that really resembled like the three soundtracks recorded by Reznor & Ross (Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl). It's very clear that this choice isn't innocent - by using this kind of soundtrack, you'll be taken automatically to a world where you can feel Jesse Eisenberg ruling the world along with Evil Corp as Mark Zuckerberg and to a place where Elliot is also not alone in the hacker fight against everything with Lisbeth at his side. This is actually a good move.On the other hand, I'm also certain that using FKA Twigs' Two Weeks in a scene where murder is being committed is a clear lack of taste.Wrapping up all negatives, Mr. Robot seems exaggerated: 1) Characters have problems beyond imagination and personal stories are way too brutal, too fantasized in such a way that the main character does not use cocaine but morphine - how exquisite. 2) The storyline is out of control trying REALLY HARD hard to be a mind f*ck (season finale is pure trash); 3) The cast is far from great and that compromises the seriousness of the series on almost all episodes, specially the ones where Portia Doubleday (playing Angela Moss) plays a big part in it. 4) Playing random songs at the end of an episode just for the sake of it is totally not is the book of rules on how to make a good series - still looking for an explanation on that 'FKA twigs x murder' scene.Finally, I'll end with a a positive note to the artistry of image and production here present.",negative
"I am in the middle of Season 2, but still not sure what is happening. It lacks good story telling. It is not like a flowing stream. Rather it is like a pond where the water is stagnant. Elliot puts up an almost same expression. He takes a long time even to smile or nod his head. Story moves back and forth from present to past and then again to present.",positive
"This serial is for computer guys. Most of the characters on the show are hackers. Its all about hacking..like..hacker's personal life...his professional life..his friends..his girlfriend..his crush..his enemy..his mission etc. So, if you think hackers are cool watch this show, you would not be disappointed. The main character is a weirdo named Elliot, he is kind of interesting and is heart of the show.Like Harvey Specter in Suits. Guy playing his role has justified his work. All the supporting cast is just average. Then comes story line, it is above average. The main problem is that the conversations include too many technical terms that makes it hard to bear sometimes. It could have been simplified a little. Direction is very good. The music is not in the league as house of cards but it not disappointing either. Mr. Robot feels a bit slow at times, I think that is demand of the main character. All in all the show is very nice but for a limited audience. This show demands handful of patience and interest in computer stuff. others would not watch more than 20 minutes. So, watch it only if it is your cup of tea.",positive
"Wauw... season 2 was really awful. It was like expanding and stretching, without the content... Budget limit's? I loved season 1 and was the best ""computer"" movie/series i have ever seen in my life, however i felt bored in season 2. Rami Malik does a good job, and the bi-roles does too, however the writers must have been making a ""lets make a lot of movies in season 2""",positive
"don't get me wrong ,, i mean the show is watchable but it has ripped off so many elements and stuff from so many great movies and series. what this show has done in addition is that their main plot is all about hacking and anarchy and crap but the characters and scenes and execution is mostly ripped off from fight club. RAMI MALIK has done an awesome job ,all the other cast is not acting at all .its like they are clowns except RAMI MALEK and Terrell they both have done brilliant acting although Terrell's character is very similar to Christan bale in American psycho.And the last 2 episodes of season 1 are full of crap its like u are watching climax of fight club in very very very slow motion . the only complain of mine towards this show is that it doesn't feel original ,, its writers are to be blamed and the creator as well the creator has very smartly stolen a lot of movies and made this series.. If you wanna watch this show ,watch it for RAMI MALEK he has done an incredible acting.And at last the Portia Doubleday has done so bad acting that her scenes wanna make me throw up .. i wish she just dies before the shooting of season 2 so that they can replace her loll",negative
"Pretty amazing show overall. The issue i have with it is the number of sorta repetitive episodes of running around and chasing and pretty much straight up dumb actions by some characters. These things made me quit the show two times but im happy that i got back to it and completed it. I feel like the show would be a 10 for me if only they reduced the number of these episodes or somehow sped up the action. The ending on the other hand is a masterpiece. It reminded me a lot of Dark ending. Very emotional, keeps you on the edge of your seat. All in all very well written and thought out.",positive
"I don't think this review contains spoilers, but I put a flag up just in case I missed something.This show is ingenious. Of course, that's the kind of hyperbole you will often see coming from fans of a show on the internet, but I really do mean it. Our lead will immediately bring Dexter to mind, only if Dexter had been a person with crushing loneliness and the inability to connect (rather than having a recurring urge to kill... something). But in both cases, our protagonist narrates us through the landscape of a world he feels he doesn't belong to.Dexter, however, kills killers. Our hero (sort of) in Mr. Robot has his sights set on MUCH bigger fish... erasing all debt from humanity's ledger, and therefore, freeing us from the biggest yoke of corporate corruption.Not surprisingly, there's an evil corporation he's set up against. In fact, E-Corp is literally called Evil Corp by everyone (including their own senior employees). Needless to say, they're creepy as all hell.Fans of old-time cinematography will have a lot to love in this series. This feels like if Stanley Kubrick had a better sense of plot-pacing, and had been hired to direct Dexter for showtime. Much of the framing of certain shots owes a lot to Kubrick, but not in a bad way. Even the title, appearing in big, stylized letters, superimposed over the action at dramatically relevant times (with the series creator's name in tiny font just below it) hearkens back to the non- flashy title cards some films shot in the 60s and 70s have had.The show, however, is anything but old-timey. It is distinctly a product of its time: a world saturated with smartphones, laptops, and circuitry. A place where we're always on camera, being recorded, and tracked. A place where our crushing debt is taken for granted as ""just the way things are"" and where people feel they need to bottle their real feelings up for fear of being blasted across the internet, or worse.If you've ever felt claustrophobic at our technological state, this show will speak to you. If you think that corporations are truly controlling everything, this show will speak to you. If you feel like CEOs of giant companies see us as annoying eaters who have little use other than to be cheap biological robots, this show will speak to you.And if you've ever wanted to stick your finger in the giant's eye, and say, ""What now, bitch?!"" this show will DEFINITELY speak to you.",positive
Well Mr. Robot has come and is now gone forever. Probably just as well. The final episode of Season 4 was pathetic. I can see now why viewers have gone down in number for this series. Biggest disappointment of the year for a TV show.,negative
"Many people will tell you this was a very intelligent and powerful show. I think it varies based on the personality type of the viewer. For me... I think it sucked.I regret wasting so many hours watching it. Being a computer nerd I enjoyed parts of the hacking stuff, but at the end of it I was just disappointed generally, mostly in myself. When you watch the king walking around naked for so long you should be able to admit to yourself there actually aren't any clothes there.Don't worry. This review and my negative attitude is not real.",negative
"First off...directors have got to stop with the narration thing jesus!!...narration is anti-arti feel like narration falls into the ""telling not showing"" category. I don't need someone walking me through something...i want to experience it all on my own. Why don't writers get this!! Or maybe am the only one who feels this way...maybe.",negative
"I watched the first 2 seasons and I got bored
To me it seemed very obvious that Christian Slater was imaginary - far too much like Fight Club - and I imagine many others saw this coming a mile away.The big hack of Evil Corp wasn't explained how it was done so simply, and with such utter global devastation when there are so many back ups and failsafes in such organisations.The ""sexy foreign woman"" with her fetishes was so over the top and her husband's entry into the toilet and partial seduction of the exec's wife - during a dinner party for 4 - was just ridiculous. and as for the rooftop murder and the lack of any kind of arrest by police - simply implausible.Then the utter boredom, adding in extra bits of other stories to drag things out.
And for such supposed geniuses, the various ways in which they get caught, such as stealing a dog or not realising that the person whose house they were staying in may actually return to the property some day!I was getting bored of the story and looked at my streaming app (Stan in Australia) to see how long it had left to go, unfortunately Stan only has 3 of the 4 seasons! but I won't be watching anyway.
The reviews I see in here give this show 10/10 and talk about the final episode being the best ever, I can't be bothered watching it that far to find out what's so good about the very final episode, too much drudgery between where I am and the final episode.",negative
"This is probably the best series I have ever watched!The acting is exceptional, the cinematography, directing, OST and photography is among the best I have seen in a series and the writing overally is second to none. I also recommend watching some youtube videos about the cinematography and - most importantly - the philosophy of mr Robot (yet after watching all the episodes, as there are spoilers which will ruin the whole experience).In addition, when the show was broadcasted for the first time, there were websites and minigames on the internet, which could be found by following some clues in the episodes.At the beginning, I thought that.it would be about a hacker, being pursued for illicit computer attacks. But this is just the background where the action takes place. Instead,it could be described as an emotional rollercoaster, in which the viewer sees the world from the eyes of a severely unstable person. It is a rare thing to encounter a purely good or bad character, as it also stands in real life. There are some really unpredictable twists (some people claim that they were able to predict them early but I was blown away, especially in S02).So, is it perfect? Nothing is perfect. There are times that it seems to be a little far-fetched and the mood is really heavy in a great part of the entire series. But, until now, it seems closer to perfect than anything else I have ever seen!Also, don't make the same mistake I did, and miss the after-credit scenes, at the end of each 1-3 seasons, as well as the first episode in the fourth season. The first one is also presented much later, in a very different context than expected.",positive
"Been watching this and am pretty far in.The lead character is one of those actors that just over-acts in any role they are in. his mannerisms are identical to the role he plaid as Freddy Mercury, sort of lost, distant, and like he is over contemplating everything.In Mr Robot many times it feel like he is special needs or in rainman mode, but other times he is fully aware and alert, and makes confident decisions. His character bounces around so often, there is no resemblance to anyone in real life and therefore is very unbelievable.He is a technical hacking genius that sometimes acts like he doesnt understand what a fork and knife are, while other times hes so deep in algorithmic code and programming, that makes the casual viewer think, whats wrong with this guy.People will talk to him and he stands there looking at the floor, but they will just stay there, in real life people would walk away.The story-line is unrealistic and chippy as the characters, and there is no depth.
The cast of characters are so flat and boring, its hard to tell the difference between them.I am giving this a solid 3 star rating, and would tell anyone to read and take the positive reviews with a grain of salt...I am convinced the studios pay people to review as part of the PR/advertising dollars, just my opinion!",negative
"There is no other tv show you can compare with mr robot. It's amazing how this show can surprise you every season, I broke when I heard m83, what a beautiful ending of a great show.",positive
"This series is best viewed as a binge watch otherwise the numerous threads of the plot get very confusing making it necessary to rewatch old episodes.
There is some amazing cinematography throughout the series and some episodes just blow your mind.
If you stop at season 3, its all good. As for season 4...its getting rather tiresome viewed on a week by week basis. Half way through the season and I have lost all interest in the fates of these characters. However, I am hanging in there to see how the body count falls out.
If there was a one word review of this series....Sybil (albeit with mad computer skills)
Hoping for the best as it winds up that its more like the movie Sybil than the real life Sybil. Disappointing either way at this point.",negative
"Writing this review is harder than I thought it would be. Firstly after waiting for nearly 2 years for season 4 to drop on Amazon Prime (living in India and still waiting) I decided to pirate the show during lockdown.I have never voted anything a 10 since I think that's a dumb use of 1-10 rating scale (better to give 5 on 5 , than waste the extra digits) so the best Mr Robot could have gotten from me is a 9 (The Sopranos, The Wire, etc), and after season 3 I was convinced that this show wouldn't drop in quality, but sadly that is not the case.Don't get me wrong, Mr Robot is still one of the best shows available today, and as commonly happens with high quality output it has to find it audience, or else.Mr Robot's themes in the final season become much more myopic than in previous seasons, focusing on Elliot's personal struggles, and while the final 3 episodes are utterly brilliant, season 4s middle episodes seem isolated.This doesn't mean that Mr Robot fails to achieve greatness, on the contrary, it is singular in its scope and themes, and Sam Esmail is without a doubt a lonely talent. Watch this show!The creativity that surrounds the cinematography is a treat especially since many of the settings are bland and grey. Symmetry abounds throughout the show, and Esmail treats you, the audience, like intelligent adults for the most part.Unfortunately I didn't feel this final season matched the scope and ambition of the first two seasons. In the final season, the ""stage play"" episode where Vera features prominently, and Krista proves herself to be a really very poor mental health practitioner seemed to be one of the poorest episodes in the entire show's oevre. It was cringeworthy to watch as each sentence was deliberately drawn out, with interruptions every 10 seconds, in a failed attempt to increase tension.I also thought the final season avoided the big picture stuff altogether, in favour of a more character driven narrative than in previous seasons.It's worth noting that the final season is not as culturally referenced as previous seasons touched on real life events like the Financial Crisis 2008, or occupy Wall Street, or Anonymous etc.Personally, I expected or wanted a closer examination of the geopolitical game between the US and China, but this was sidelined in favour or a more parochial outlook.Thankfully the show recovered and brought the story arc to a satisfying close.All in all a really great show, but the final season just failed to reach the heights I expected. 8 on 10.",positive
I'm sad to say I'm only finished Mr Robot now. It was easily one of the best shows I seen in recent years. And the ending really surprised me.,positive
"I like the main character, remembered him from Night at the Museum. I was digging this show. I like gritty/dark. It was a little over the top and the hacking/security seemed a little hokey, but it is entertainment, you can forgive some of the details (a little) if it's entertaining. However, when they got to the whole redistribution thing and everyone is unfairly in debt... Nope, I'd seen enough.I put myself through college, so I have no sympathy for folks with high student loan debt. No one put a gun to their head and said you have to go to college and you have to go into massive debt to go to college. This show sends an incorrect/naive message.I should not have to pay for someone else's poor choices.",negative
"Story not only ressambles a creator's hardwork. But, all the actors and their cast also. This show just makes you feel that.
It will take you to the Fear of Missing out influential level, plus darker it gets as the plot moves ahead. Not just Rami, but carly, slater, portia, all were pieces of the puzzle.
Sam Esmail to be applauded from the first line lf the show to the end scene.",positive
"First off, it took me a while to get around to watch Mr. Robot. I'm not into computers and it seemed to me like it as a series about hackers and it really put me off for some timeWell, it's not.Ok, the premise is about hackers and a major hack, but the essence of the show is about so much more. I've balled my eyes out feeling for Elliot and his self contempt , his urge to find out why he is the way he is, the longing to belong. Mr Robot strikes so many chords that I really can't say anything other then WOW.The production, cinematography, editing, soundtrack and acting are all first class. Rami Malek is perfectly cast as well. Sam Esmail, hats off to you.One of the best series ever made. The story will blow you away. Can highly recommend.",positive
"All 4 season of Mr. Robot is just high quality entertainment and a wonder to watch. Psychology, world economy, twists, comedy, shock, tragedy, government vs people, police and gangsters, Joey Bada$$, a fish named qwerty... A boy who loves a girl. Sam Esmail made a masterpiece. Will watch this show over and over.",positive
The show is about mental illness and hacking. That's what the show is about.,negative
5 episodes in.. it is really not the series that people make it out to be. Its like the show trying to be too hard to be slick and cool. The premise for the subplots dint make sense or even remotely realistic.,negative
Rami Malek's performance is absorbing.The pilot episode was so promising However I was disappointed in the way story progressed. The latter half of the season with all of its big reveals simply made me change the channel. I am stopping after watching the first season. Over used plot lines makes this show a waste of time.,negative
"Season 4 makes the show worth it to watch. Just amazing how deep it gets into Elliot's mind and how easy makes it to understand.A masterpiece musically, visually with a perfect mind-blowing ending.",positive
"Some people will hate this show. It requires some effort and it requires that you pay attention while watching it. Often, and to be honest; the part that bugs me, there will be something that happened 3 or 4 episodes previous. You will have to remember it to really get the most out of the story. Much like an independent or European film, sometimes very subtle things can say so much. Unfortunately, when you put something subtle 4 episodes previous (or even in a previous season), things get a little tricky. Apart from that? I love it! The situational drama can be intense! The story is enigmatic and amazing. It's not everybody's cup-of-tea I get that. For someone who likes to play the drums while they watch TV...or maybe someone who just doesn't like to think...or maybe someone who knows enough about computers to be offended by the misappropriation of Syntax (and/or logical properties) then this wouldn't be the show for them.",positive
"This TV series is great for people who are phenomenally stupid. To them, it offers deep, profound insights into the workings of our society. For example, did you know that our so- called freedom of choice is nothing more than the freedom to choose between Coke or Pepsi? Yes, that's the kind of a life-changing insight you'll be able to enjoy if you watch this show.I knew that the show is going to be a pile of crap the moment they showed the main protagonist, a youngish hacker, burn a bunch of CDs using his computer. Who today burns CDs anymore? Obvious technology-based drivel written by people who don't know the first thing about technology.Warning: don't watch if you're allergic to awful acting. Probably the worst acting seen on TV thus far.",negative
"Holy Smokes. I absolutely fell in love with this series. I was late to the party but I'm glad that I hopped onto the train because man oh man was it worth it. I will start my review with the story which follows a man by the name of Elliot who is a hacker and it's about how his story and the world around him unfolds. The acting is honestly Incredible with every hiring decision being Impeccable. Rami Malek who plays Elliot is genius and Christian Slater who plays Mr.Robot is Awesome as well but my favorite actor was Tyrell Wellick. He is played by Martin Wallstrom who is perfect. He is a mix of Patrick Bateman, Roy Batty and Drake from Hobo with a Shotgun. I mean he is honestly second to Rami who stole the show. I will now move onto the action and I would not say that there is a ton of action but there is a plethora of drama which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire season. The cinematography was Superb with every scene being beautifully orchestrated. I will close out by saying this is a Must-Watch show. I mean it delves into very real and precarious situations that we as citizens and people around the world face daily. The fact that technology is going to keep becoming more invasive as time continues is what really makes this new show a contender for one of the greatest shows on network television. I can't wait for Season Two.",positive
One thing about this series. We never expected what happens next in this series .it was start to end it is thrilling .there are many twists and turns.you are computer lover you must enjoy it .must watch series.,positive
If you haven't watched it yet go watch it immediately. One of the best series I've ever watched and it has a wonderful ending !!!!,positive
"I have watched two seasons of Mr Robot and I am still not sure how to interpret it. The only thing that I can say for sure is that the main character of this show is severely mentally disturbed drug addict, dangerous to himself, people around him and the society at large. Beyond that there are two possible interpretations, neither of which gives many reasons for watching it
1) If this show is supposed to be about hacking, computer technologies, exposing the negative effects of corporate culture on the people, and attempt to improve the society through bringing about some catastrophic changes, then this show is a complete and utter failure, as both technical accuracy of what is shown and the level of sophistication and depth of the characters are completely nonexistent and the events look like a perverted teenage fantasy rather than the real world
2) The other interpretation is that this show is a study of how the world looks like through eyes of someone with severe psychological problems, paranoya and drug addiction. This interpretations makes a bit more sense, but then the show is just way too long, not particularly original and offers nothing for any person with a modicum of imagination. There is no compelling reason to wallow in this bleak, pointless and contrived fantasy.
The only thing that is good in the show is quality acting and that is what brings up my rating to 4 stars.",negative
"This Show is good in a manner that the story keeps flowing, the characters are good, acting is fabulous, and well certainly control you sub-consciously.",positive

"This show is trying to mimic Fight Club and Dexter obviously, but the plot is so predictable and awful. It is full of cliché, and it tried to mix Marxism/populism with the geek culture (what a terrible combination!), in a very shallow, brainless way.It is clear that the target audience of this show is those who thought that drug addict can be controlled and their debt should be just cleared.============================================= Watching it is really a waste of time.",negative
"Now, first of all I'm gonna address these clowns in the review section who had one boring episode and their panties twisted so much to give this 1 - 5 stars. Jesus Christ, if you can't watch something heartbreaking and more mature like this, then stick with your teenager
romantic shows and major thing here, have a little patience it does gives you one of the best experience in a show in the third and fourth season.The second season, now I'm gonna be honest with you, it was so boring in first half of episodes that I was so sure about quitting. I got aggravated and started asking people if they actually LIKED this show with a season like that. But then again, I thought ""hey, why not watch the whole season and then see if it's good or not"". And that decision was a fortunate one. Around the last episodes, things started to accelerate and took an uphill and finally made a satisfactory cliffhanger in the final episode. Let's suppose maybe even if you don't like the second season at all, trust me on this, I'm Obama if you don't start getting hooked on in third season. The character Irving, and the return of Tyrell made the show entirely different from what it was one season ago.Every season of this show feels like they're from different shows. Every part of this show is executed perfectly. Nobody can say otherwise. The acting, the writing, the photography, the direction, the soundtracks, the scenario themes, the characters there's no flaw in it like shows like a Game of Thrones and The Wire cause the prior has a fu*ked up ending and the latter has cheesy stereotypical writing and acting.The mental stress it puts upon you is unsettling. There's no flaw in the show whatsoever and that's my guarantee. The writing and direction is better than anything released this past 5 years and that's a fact.The mental illness is an interesting topic itself and personality disorder of Ellior just added the cherry on the top. It feels so fresh to see this show. No bad scenes, no unnecessary dialogues, characters, no plot armour or plot holes I mean everything you expect in a show is here if you just ignore the fillers+cannon episodes in the beginning of second season that's all. I mean look, even Breaking Bad had boring second season, Sopranos had boring first season, well Game Thrones made its last two season like it was a joke. So what's bad in the show if it has a slow pace for 4 to 5 episodes??..... I mean it's understandable right?Now, don't misunderstand this show to be all about a genius protagonist hacking big things and getting away everytime always with more hacks like every single typical hacking show/movie does. With progression of every single episode as Elliot thinks the situation is bad, something worse is waiting for him. The hacking is the least interesting part the more it progresses. I mean it's more of a sentimental-gore-crime-thriller than a hacking show. I always judged Rami Malek from his looks and his roles in movies. And trust me I've never regretted that so much after the 7th episode of final season.The thrill it has and the way the crimes are shown will leave you mesmerized. This show started is from 2015 and it has the quality of a show like it's made in 2050. The camera rolling is all it took me to realise thie shows potentiality. Character development is just...... I can't even describe it. The characters have so much significance and inadvertent relations with each other that you may have trouble picking on your favourite character from the series.I don't have enough words to describe the experience I had with this show but I never thought this would be my 2nd best show defeating Sopranos and Wire.",positive
"One of the greatest shows I´ve ever seen. Continuously plays with the reliance on the narrator making each season enjoyable to watch keeping each of them fresh with ingenious and well thought cliffhangers. Great acting on behalf of Rami Malek and Christian Slater. The show is definitely not for everyone, but is one of a kind and if you are looking for a mind bending experience Mr. Robot won´t disappoint.",positive
"I watched the series in 2 days without breathing. Along with great acting, thought-provoking scripts and shooting angles; I was fascinated by his rhetoric that reflects life with all its reality and makes everything questionable. It would not be out of place to say that it is an antidepressant that arouses curiosity until the last second of the final scene and keeps the brain running constantly. I can say that it made me love my depression with my depressive state, it felt really good. I just finished it but will watch it again...",positive
One of my favorite TV shows of all time. I was one of those people who loved the first season and then felt the second season was a bit slow for me so I stopped watching it altogether. A few weeks later I decided to give it a second chance and I am so glad I did. Seasons 3 & 4 were the best seasons ever. Mind blown. It makes you want to rewatch the whole series over again with a new perspective. Brilliant story and perfect how everything from all seasons ties together perfectly. The camerawork is amazing as well. Just watch it.,positive
"First of all I have to say, I felt connected with Malek in many ways. His anti-social behavior, his view of the modern society, his drug habit, his relationships etc. The pilot was on a good start from the very first minute and it grew on me as it unraveled. I found myself craving for more and more each minute it passed, to the point I stopped the video to check how much more it had left (it was about at the 40min mark, with another or so minuted to go). I don't really love the fact that Malek is delusional, as it may provide an easy solution for nearly EVERYTHING that will go on as the show moves, but if played right, it can become the whole show itself, so meh, I don't know how to feel about that. His relationship with Angela was rather dull, until the point he went and defended her on the meeting, thus justifying not turning the fscociety group to the authorities as his moral code was all about (this and the nearly 200,000$ of student loans she has). Anyway I didn't wanted this to turn out analyzing every turn this episode took so I will stop here. I give it 8/10 with high hopes (and great fear as well) for the next episode! La Ku",positive
"As an avid tv watcher, I've unfortunately been bored of almost everything lately. But if you have time to watch anything, watch Mr. Robot. I guarantee you it is impossible to be disappointed by this show. 10/10 my favorite show ever!",positive
This show just keeps getting better - Moments in season three were truly epic some of the best TV in a long time and the tension increases through season four as the true depth and invention of this masterpiece unfold before us. A huge success for everyone involved.,positive
"Some of the most incredible story writing, editing and acting to date. Been watching since day 1 and I have never finished an episode without it either blowing my mind or causing me to ponder life for days thereafter.There is honestly a hole in my heart now that it's over, but the writing is so truly brilliant that they've given me closure and I can move on feeling like I've lived, learned, and grown as a person during my realtionship with this show.Although I can't imagine I'll love a show this much ever again, I'm a better person because of it.",positive
"Very complex and confusing, as usual though, ALL the bad guys are White males",negative
"I have just finished this show (I know im late to the party) and my god. This show is perfect in every way. Rami Malek is so well picked for this role, and I can't believe its taken me this long to finish watching it. I cannot recommend this show enough, do yourself the biggest favor of your life and watch it!",positive
"I decided to give it a 10 from the very start cause after a long, long while I spent an hour of my life on a pilot that made me feel that there might yet be something new under the sun. I really enjoyed the story, which was quite tense but yet utterly believable. There is so much to explore and dig deep into the story and keep the tension of the viewers, without crossing the border of TV-realism plausibility.The casting is great. Rami Malek (whom to be honest I have not heard of before, although he seems familiar) is a great choice for the main role. Enough troubled looking and thank God he is not blond, if you know what I mean.We are face to face with some not so radical ideas anymore about what our world has actually become, and my only fear, for now, is that the plot might turn into: 'Corporations are actually not that bad. Please come and work for us Elliot, you are great'. if it comes to that, it will be such a sad, sad loss of potentially amazing series. We all see, especially on mainstream TV, a dark and realistic depiction of corporations that is often followed by a change of heart and, 'Look, they are not actually that bad' type of story. Whatever the case will just wait and see what follows. Looking forward to the second episode, and I'll probably watch the pilot again!",positive
"For those who haven't had the chance to start watching this, don't delay or hesitate. This is one of the best series on TV. All I can say is: that finale is the way finales should be. Sad, and mindblowing. Brilliant work of art!",positive
This is the worst series i have ever seen in my life. Writers have no clue about what they want to achieve. Direction sucks so bad that you do not feel connected to the show in even the most important scenes. The actors and the basic characterization are so bad that you just want to kill them. The main actor is so bad that you just want to kill him. He does not have a clue about the plan that he is working on. His sister's and crush's character are so irritating that you cannot watch them for a minute without yawning. The masterminds look like clowns. There is not even a single scene in the whole show which i remember even though i have watched it 3 hours earlier. Save yourself from depression by not watching this.,negative
"You read that right, this is one of the most important and best pieces of art ever made in human history.The whole show is epic ride but season 4 is like the best ride on earth.Many, many layers to this show you simply cannot put it into words.Topics include: Escapism, Social Commentary, Class Warfare and accepting reality.Might change your life, please watch.",positive
"Nowdays it's not easy to find a real original and interesting series. This one is definitely The One! Finally an interesting mix of psychological problems, society disorders, conspiracy and a huge amount of good acting... A blast!! Downsides: Maybe the last chapters of the 1st season are not really interesting as the previous ones, but the plot stays interesting anyway. I can't wait to see the next season.If you like crazy stories about hacking... conspiracies and strange theories about the world. Welcome to Mr. Robot! You won't regret the time you will spend watching this masterpiece!",positive
"After completing the Season 1, Mr. Robot certainly keeps me waiting for the following season. I'm glad the series did not extensively stress on ""hacking"" as the main theme (projected in the trailer and such) and went a little further to emphasize on today's society and reality.I'm a huge fan of the cinematography in each episode and get excited every time i see the words ""MR. ROBOT"" appear in front of my screen. Another aspect you won't find in many series is how Elliot (Rami Malek) addresses the audience as his ""imaginary friend"" and talks to us indirectly as we are the ones controlling his mind. As much as i hate the unfulfilled plot holes that were left to be answered in Season 2, i loved what creator Sam Esmail introduced throughout the season. The soundtrack is on point; one of the best i've heard that gives me that Social Network vibe. This is a must watch for those interested in Tech and/or like to experience a new theme of crime and thriller.",positive
"I watched this show more than 3 times now, the only negative thing that you can say about Mr. Robot is that it has an ending its perfect the cinematography, the pacing, the characters, the character devolopment and the ending this series is playing with your mind you never know whats really happening, you never know what's coming next even when you think think you get it now you just simply don't. Its perfect in every way, and even if you re-watch it you see more and more little details more and more foreshadowing to the ending. Thank you Sam esmail for creating this seriesMr. Robot is peak fiction it's the best series ever created.",positive
"... mix bag of every single amoral trash you can put in, and they're put in there just for the sake of it, often totally unnecessary. Don't waste your time, just another garbage Hollywood production designed to normalize perversion.",negative
"I am gonna go ahead and tell you that Mr Robot is easily my new favorite show on TV. This show follow the hacker Elliot and he suffers from the problem of social anxiety and he is not able to connect with people. I have not seen a show that is so well written and acted and directed since the first season of True Detective and all of Breaking Bad. The performances from Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and the whole rest of the cast is some of the best acting their is on TV right now if not the best. This show is also incredibly well filmed and the cinematography really makes you fell the gritty and dark tone the show has. The show also has some huge plot twist near the end which some people may not love but I thought it was incredibly well done and it really helped develop all the characters. Every episode of the season helped develop the character and their was always something going on that was engaging. If this show keep this up it has potential to be my favorite TV show of all time. I strongly recommend watching this show if you have not seen it yet.",positive
"Foremost, I have to say that I've held my judgement and my review until the plot can develop. All of the ""genius"" reviewers who raved at the Pilot and cried at episodes 2 & 3 not meeting their expectations...just needed to take a deep breath and widen their vision. Yes, there were things that didn't make sense and pieces that seemed implausible at first viewing, but those moments develop into supporting pieces of the evolving story line. If you get bored and lash out the first time there is a loose end or something you don't understand, maybe you should stick to mainstream shows that tie everything in a nice bow after every episode.Despite the long shot percentage chance of certain conditions taking place and the simplicity in the description of events that would certainly be much more difficult and more complicated, the plot is fantastic, the writing is excellent and Rami Malek kills it as Elliot. Many reviewers have decided to pick at any little imperfection and try and tear apart a well balanced show...as if they could have done better. What most fail to understand is that...yes...you could depict the show a bit more realistically and make events develop slower and with more challenge to the characters, but THEN the show wouldn't move along fast enough to keep the attention of your average ADD tech junkie and then viewers would complain about that. The whole production of the show is a balance and sometimes TV probability and TV physics wins out over reality in the name of public interest and squeezing the episodes into 40 minutes. I could spend more time elaborating on my opinion of the review situation, but no one cares what I say because I'm just a single voice in the noise. In the end, Mr. Robot is an amazingly good show and I cannot wait to see where they go from here. If you're on the fence, check it out...but do yourself a favor and go in with a bit of patience and an open mind. I have intentionally avoided specific citations from the show, as I don't want to spoil anyone's personal experience discovering it for themselves and I don't feel like any single description or event can adequately describe the show and the underlying genius. (Yes, I said genius.) The real genius (said it again) is the restraint that the writing shows...the patience in letting the story develop and the excellent delivery of Malek, Chaikin, Doubleday, Wallstrom, Slater and an amazing cast of supporters. Well done!",positive
"I almost did mid season 2, but I am glad I didn't. Definitely has some downs, but the ups make it worth it imo. Get ready for an emotional rollercoaster.",positive
"I've had my share of experience when it comes to TV and I got to say there is are level in which the shows can be categorized..As for the levels I know everyone can understand which level I'm talking about when I say Breaking bad,Supernatural,Sherlock,The wire etc I'm not gonna talk about what kind of story it's about,what's its setting etc.....All you need to know that Mr.Robot is up there and so go watch it..its captivating from the 1st moment...just watch it you'll understand..",positive
"The actor not only looks like Freddy mercury, he is our Freddy mercury, because Freddy Mercury had the same exposing intention as Rami Malek and Christian Slater in this series, great writing and production.About the story:
Probably this is what happens on behind closed doors, and the real consequences of hacking. This also reveals what type of World we live in, how we just try to take each other resources in a fight to the death instead of cooperate and coordinate, be accountable and be recognized and priced for a good job; the way we live, has to stop, change to an adaptive social evolution into a new system, or this will be the everyday of humans, cave-man attitude, just better tools. Extremism leads to this, proportioned responses and compassion, leads to discussion and that to civility and peaceful solutions; Mr. Robot teach us all important lessons while being entertaining with justified drama, exemplary, worth your time",positive
I love Mr robot he is cracter cute i love rami malk,positive
"For seasons 1-3 I don't have anything more to say that other reviews - it is a great show in almost every aspect.
Season 4 - the plots about Eliott' mental state & Whiterose's plan and history - great. Where lapses start are the main drivers of the story.
Let me say - direction, production, acting, visuals and script are of a very high quality.
Overarching problems with the plot:
1. It is ridiculous to have us believe that a large group (or any individual in that matter) of the richest people on Earth will ALL hold ALL of their money in a single bank, protected by a mere 2FA - like come on! Even middle class knows to hold their money in multiple banks and accounts and implement stronger security.
2. The idea that anyone ""top 1% of top 1%"" will have any significant amount of their wealth in money in a bank account is 9-year-old mindset - laughable.
3. An investment group with presumably trillions in assets goes broke by moving their cash? Does not make any sense if one has understanding of Finance.
4. If Deus group has the assets, global influence and government/corporate connections as displayed - money is meaningless - they would always be able to manipulate markets or just loan from the printed central banks' money (as currently done all around the world).Other weak point with the plot:
1. Whiterose killing Angela and hence losing leverage over Price and Elliot.
2. Whiterose not killing Elliot earlier(he is a genius but making it like he is the only one that execute ""the hack"" is lazy.
3. Having ex-junkie for account manager of your billion-dollars account???
4.Not being able to trace Elliot/Darlene when they are just walking around New York with cameras everywhere.
5. Underweight coder who barely eats or sleeps being able to outrun half of NYPD.
6. Media working for Deus when the plot needs it but when than switching it up.
7. Darlene just walking out of active criminal scene like np.
8. Whiterose not tracking/simply calling Wellick on the important day???
9. Dom and Darlene not shooting the Dark Army operatives when they caught them arguing.
...
Overall, sadly a lot of intelligence-insulting tools are used to move the plot ahead in season 4. Still a nice show to watch on artistic level and if you are ready to put aside your Finance and business knowledge and some of your common sense. I would give it 7.5.",positive
"I suffered through all 4 seasons of this show, hoping it would get to the point. It never did. I give major kudos to the cast for some great acting, but I was really disappointed.
It was interesting to watch, so I don't feel that I wasted any time. I enjoyed the characters as they came and went, and again, the acting was superb.
I thought I had it figured out toward the end of season 4, but then the final episode derailed that theory. The ending left me wanting for an explanation. What the hell was this even about?
Maybe someday I can have a pint or two of beer with someone who can explain this to me, and I will watch it again.
I gave it 7 stars because of the acting, not for the substance.",positive
"I will go straight to the point. You thought your local dentist visits were painful, try this and you'd wish you had been kinder to the doctor. It's totally crap. One other show comes to mind as I write this...arrow. I just couldn't get the plot no matter how interested I was. Don't watch this, watch something else.",negative
"I have watched it up to the third episode to find out why the IMDb rating is so goddamn high and I have still not found out why. I cannot go five minutes watching an episode without almost killing myself in frustration about how the writers cannot at least come up without a good dialogue. cinema blend's review of it as damn near perfect is what even pisses me off the most how can a series that terrible be rated so highly? I'm not much of a series person but the few that I watch are a lot better that this and their rating is not even as high. I'm talking about The Flash, Arrow and Silicon Valley. I mean, come on!, who names a series Mr Robot? In the third episode when the ""Mr Robot"" met Malek in the office, I was disappointed at how something like that could even happen. I mean, were there no other workers?, couldn't he have called security?, I mean, the guy just tried to kill you!. While watching the first episode, I was hoping that it would live up to the high rating because at the time, it was 9.5 which is pretty goddamn high for a new series, I was not happy at the end of that episode, i watched the second one with hopes that it would be better or at least, watch the rating drop substantially, I was disappointed at the end of that episode too. The third episode just killed me, I couldn't finish watching it because I could not stomach my frustration anymore and had to pour out my anger somewhere before it drives me to kill myself, or somebody. The absolute truth in a nutshell is that I'm disappointed.",negative
If there are more than 10 stars imma give em to this fantastic show lets talk about how great the acting is that's one thing the other thing is the number of plot twist in it and if you like tech or computer science in general trust me this is the one for you.,positive
"Some key points of s01:-
1) Elliot(the hack guy) is a """" psycho"""", who hallucinates of his father.
2) Music and themes are ""TERRIBLE.""
3) Acting of almost all the characters is of ""Sub STANDARD""
4)Story is really weak.
5) Producer and writer have tried to be over smart in every minute of the story which makes everything FAKE and CREEPY.
6) It is a good show for kids who can watch anything on the name of Hacking.",negative
"Am I the only one that got super tired of the way every single person knocking on a door did so like they were and f'n SWAT team? Nobody in this whole series could just knock on the door like a normal person but instead had to bang on it nonstop?
Then I guess in New Jersey and New York no one has ever heard of a peephole on the door to see who's banging on it?
Anyway, awesome show! A little slow at times and the characters taking 30 seconds to answer a question cuz they're staring off in a long gaze gets a little tiring to watch but yeah... good show!
Sure are a few quite funny and odd looking characters in this show... borderline creepy, men and women both!",negative
"I watched the first season of Mr. Robot and was very taken with the story line, acting, direction and overall development. I could barely get through Season 2: the story line is so confusing, the sound track and music so loud and interfering with dialogue that I found it frustrating to hear. (This seems to be a tendency with many new TV series that get swept up in a higher music to dialogue sound ratio and frankly, it's so annoying - even with a good bluetooth speaker). I struggled through Season 2 because I really like Rami Malek but I will not continue watching after the mess of Season 2. I found it incomprehensible, pretentious and lacking the cohesive punch of Season 1. I cannot recommend this series beyond Season 1 but I know others may feel differently. You be the judge but I do not want to waste my time.",negative
"I don't know what happened. Maybe it's that every time I pick up a storyline, it turns out to be a lie. Idk. Maybe that's the point. He can't trust anyone and neither can the viewer. I think I have resigned myself to being wrong every time, so what's the point, I guess? I really love the characters though. I really love the premise, seeing both sides and that many things don't work out when you think you have it all worked out. I like the portrayal of someone living with D.I.D. I have similar symptoms. I am often afraid to ask where I am or if I know the person I'm talking to. I don't want people to figure out my weakness and exploit that. I have also arrived places and didn't know how I got there and why I'm not appropriately dressed - club wear at work. It's all very disorienting, so I like how that is portrayed. Oh - my favorite - trying to introduce a friend to another friend or at work and I've known them for a while and can't introduce them, because I forgot everyone's name and then I start to almost cry and stand frozen. Gotta practice that more. :) Walking into Walmart and stuck at the door with friends and I can't remember why I'm there and how I got there. People have just called me dingy. That's unfortunate, but what do they know??!! Crying spells, because I'm lonely, because I can't relate to people, because I don't know if I met them before...or was it a dream...? Or, how I don't wanna let them know off the bat that I don't know how I got there and then wonder if I'm being rude or stupid. So, I am a perfect target for a power monger.",positive
"I never thought that a tv show would have such an effect on my life. Mr Robot is incredible. Sam Esmail is an absolute genius and Rami Malek!!!! Man, he's fantastic!Seriously recommend this to EVERY HUMAN ON THE PLANET!",positive
Apart from the series Lost this has had to be the biggest waste fo my viewing time.You might has well have jumped frrom series 1 episode 1 to series 4 episode 13 as everything inbetween was totally meaningless.,negative
"When you think, that you have grasp on the story Sam Esmail brutally pull the rug out of viewer's legs, by serving intriguing, and surprising turn of events, dressed into heavy coat of psychological drama, and brilliant cinematography.Even tho the show starts like a classic corporate/hacker thriller, it steadily evolves into more, and more embroiled psychological drama containing a lot of thriller bits, to keep us awake. The final season resembles a blooming flower which with every episode shades the petals, and exposes the naked truth.Honestly, I don't remember when was the last time when I watched something so amazing, and impactful in a TV show format.Brilliant, and unpredictable to the very end.",positive
First when u watch this series u think how simple it is to understand and it is a normal series like others but I assurre u that this series is something super cool and weird ur brain will blow up,positive
"Elliot's internal dialogue with his therapist (spoiler); What disappoints you so much with society? Is it that we thought Steve Jobs was a great man even though we know he made millions off the backs of children. Or maybe its as though we feel all our heroes are counterfeit(like Lance Armstrong, Bill Cosby). That the world itself is just one big hoax, spamming with our running commentary of bullshit, masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. We want to be sedated because its painful not to pretend because we're cowards.and...""I am really good at reading people...my secret? I look for the worst in people."" This is a show on the psychology of layers felt but rarely discussed. Not because we are afraid, because most just cannot. In Elliot, we get someone who is so lost inside and lonely, all he has is truth...truth to the point of tearing apart. The place most ignore. People like Elliot do exist. The non-conformists who won't sell out. Those who truly understand; You cannot get someone to understand something when their career depends upon them not understanding it.",positive
"I just watched the s04 finale and it couldn't have ended more brilliantly. Bravo Sam Esmail. Never have I been so thoroughly hooked by a tv show from beginning to end. Very sad to say goodbye to Elliot and this series. What an incredible journey. OMGIMO: I don't believe there is a better writer than Esmail at the present or, at least one who can translate their complex vision so efficiently and effectively. Though a large stake to this marvelous screen gem has to do with the cast and Rami Malek's stunning eyes. I think what initially hooked me to this show was Rami's eyes when he was check-mating the pervert in the cafe' on the first episode. He effectively portrayed the look of an aloof vigilante hacker with a purpose. What an amazing actor omg.",positive
"This show is not just normal one,From a technical point of view it's my top 10,rami don't just do his job as the actor of the elliot rule.sometimes during show i ask myself this guy is the same freddie mercury from bohemian rhapsody?As a normal and casual cinema lover,this cast and this crew are sooooo underrated and deserve more than that.",positive

"Is one show which pulls me in 2 absolutely different directions) Still a solid 6 ,but not as good as many think...

All in all decent one time watch , but nothing really extraordinary...",negative
"I've always found writing introductions in reviews to be a piece of cake. I usually open with a general impression and then I proceed to pick the film or series apart, carefully pointing out the things that caught my eye. This, as you've probably deduced, is an exception. The first season of ""Mr. Robot"" left me literally speechless, if you exclude the screams of disbelief during the last few episodes.So, what nerve did ""Mr. Robot"" strike ? All of them.Although Rami Malek is the star of the show and, naturally, the spotlight was on him, I feel that the performances of the rest of the cast were severely neglected. I will not single out anyone and there is no doubt that the cast as a whole deserves far more praise than they receive. Another aspect of the show that went relatively unnoticed was the soundtrack. The electro-vibes that can be heard in each episode contribute to the overall feeling of cyberpunk paranoia, but I just can't not mention the use of the piano cover of ""Where Is My Head"" by the Pixies. The cinematography ? Unusual. I did not know what to make of it but as the series progressed, I came to realize that the weird shots (such as the characters being confined to the very edge of the screen) had much more purpose than what I originally thought was going to be ""weird for the sake of weird"". As for the the story - nothing (and I mean NOTHING) is unintentional. If you pay attention you might be able to figure out just what is going on, but If you are like me, the second viewing will be as rewarding as the first.Finally, If you're still having doubts about this show, give the first episode a chance and bid your social life farewell for the next 11 hours or so. You will not regret it.",positive
"First off, I want to say I have read a lot of reviews, and then read a TON of negative reviews, to try and grasp some sort of understanding of how they got their opinion on the show. With that being said I will continue my personal view, and state a few reasons why some may have negatively viewed it.I connected with Mr. Robot immediately from the first episode, the show is just incredibly well written, from the dialogue, to the characters lack of emotional and monotone presence, and even his flaws, which looked at negatively started to grow on me, (which I will go into at the end of this.) I wanted to say all the hacking scenes are in fact how they are really done, and do not sugar coat anything. Everything in this show is true down to the very core of its entire presence, and meaning, which can only be understood by finishing Season 2.Mr. Robot was an eye opener that I feel everyone needs to view with an open mind, clearly myself being in the technology space, and having hacked as a child for my own personal reasons, I related well to this show. However hacking is not the purpose of this shows full intent, it goes so deep into the mind of a character you may not 100% relate to, but know he exists in this world so you feel in touch with him. Mr. Robot is battling himself in multiple characters, one that wants to change the world, and free everyone from the grasp of a corrupt system. Down to the lost young soul, who is dealing with social anxiety issues, and sadly a drug addiction. Of course as I stated, you must have an open mind, if you are not open minded, this show is not for you... Shall I continue? Diving deep into the negative criticism that seemed mostly spawned over the first 3-4 episodes, I feel viewers did not truly give it the chance it deserved before rating the show, therefor could not possibly offer the readers an accurate review. I personally will not watch a TV show until a 2nd season has been completed, so therefore my review is being written a month after binge watching the full 2 seasons in less than a week. Which a month later.. I still cannot stop thinking about as I write this review.From my personal perspective I think viewing any drug addiction can have a strongly negative effect on its viewers. I was a bit shocked to watch them dive so deeply into his addiction, and social disassociation, which for me, was tough to watch, as it was portrayed all throughout season 1. Then I realized, what is a person, without a flaw? How do you find someone so careless, yet so optimistic about life? Someone who lacks the social qualities, which keep him up late at night scouring the dark web, and hacking everyone who crosses his path? You infuse a drug problem. Now you have created a ticking time bomb of which is, Mr. Robot.I ask viewers to rate the show after Season 2. As I honestly could not find a single reason to rate this show anything less than a 10/10. I personally am writing this review because I cannot believe this show is not ranked up to the level of Breaking Bad, which btw... I had a hard time watching at first, then once you get over the entire disgusting meth thing the show is entirely based on, you find something amazing. Just as you surely will find by venturing into the mind of... Mr. Robot.",positive

"This is, by far, my favorite TV show of all time. I came for the cybersecurity elements, but I stayed for the beautiful and masterful cinematography, camerawork, acting, plot, character development, soundtrack, scoring, etc. This is not a hacking show. Its a psychological drama/thriller trip with realistic hacking elements sprinkled in.The themes of mental health, drug abuse, and most importantly, our stresses/traumas and how we overcome them are handled very well, although some might not be able to handle these.Its a show that might not appeal to everyone, but to the people who invest in it and truly watch it, it's an incredible experience from the beginning to the very end.",positive
"Season 1 starts with fast paced plot developments and thought provoking ideas. Unfortunately this fizzles out quickly. The shows reveals itself as a slow mental breakdown of Alice in Wonderland that just drags on in season 2. The crazy jumps off the wall at every corner and one just wants to turn the telly off and forget you've peaked into this dark hole. Personally I don't like being part of some one else's slow and agonizing mental breakdown when I'm trying to relax.Despite writers seemingly consuming too much hallucinogenics when writing the script, this show looks to be heading towards a predictable conclusion.Personally I think this is one of the worst attempts at entertainment I've experienced on TV.",negative

the only problem i find was with S2 (bit slow and story didn't really progressed, but character development was brilliant)S1 - 9/10
S2 - 8/10
S3 - 9.5/10
S4 - 11/10GO WATCH IT NOW !!!!",positive
"What the heck did I just watch? Am I too psychologically messed up to be ""living"" inside the head of another psychopath? Any good story has to begin with a good beginning. The first five words of a novel. The first minute or two of a video.There is no established purpose. No established reference point. The viewer is just left floating above a non-distinct landscape hoping (against hope, because it is not going to happen) that his feet will finally land somewhere.The plot aimlessly bounces along between the pinball bumpers of nonsensical sequences. In short, this piece is a worthless fragment of someone's incomplete dream.And, not only can I NOT follow along with the protagonist, I am supposed to care about what happens to him in the cliffhanger ending? I'm siding that the group he is confronted with eats him alive . . . and the series ended as well.If this is the future of television entertainment, we are all in a very sorry state indeed.",negative
"One of the best shows ever made.
everything is masterpiece about this show especially the phenomenal Season 4.",positive
"I started watching this show 2 times. The first time when it came out I managed 1.5 seasons and now after it ended I managed 2.5 seasons. People say ""it will blow your mind"" but nothing really happens there. They just walk around and talk with no real depth. Nothing in this show reflects reality. It's all made up like flat earth. I don't think I am able to finish it. It's so boring. Maybe if they compressed 4 seasons into 1 there would be something happening. Also, the plot is just ridiculous. It's a sci-fi drama, not a crime, thriller show. Besides Eliot all characters are so unlikable I want to FF just not to watch them. Save yourself some time and skip this one.",negative
"I know... Even if Mr. Robot has (steals?) the same plot of fractured mind-doppelganger-split personality when main character's mental state went deteriorated and his mind formed a new personality as in Chuck Palahniuk & David Fincher's book and movie respectively. It's a good show only because is well acted, produced, written, directed and produced. It's obvious Sam Esmail is a devoted watcher of TV and Movies, his show is very influenced by it as he uses the first person talking like the ""Narrator"" and pays some tributes to icons like Pulp Fiction as well. Rami Malek is cool, even in Edward Norton's '99 shoes... Christian Slater as the new version of Tyler Durden is fine, he always had been a good actor anyways. And the secondary characters are a good ensemble. Hooray for Carly Chaikin (Darlene) a kind of Marla Singer, Martin Wallström is so nuts and and a personal quote if I may... I love Stephanie Corneliussen (Joanna)Hope the quality in the second season don't came with low quality of plots and subplots.",positive
Very interesting hacking story that goes boring via personality disease view at the middle of the 2nd season. What a pity.,negative
For those that hate this show simply do not understand the complexity of it. If you really pay attention and have an IQ over 90 you may just understand this show.,positive
What started as a good show ended up 4 seasons later as a bad emotional drama with a terrible soundtrack.,negative
"This one promises a lot of potential. I do enjoy the use of a narrator into some stories, and, in this one i really believe is something that makes the difference. The action is well paced and the main actor is very accurate for this role, a Young, weird, and intriguing young guy. The story itself may keep you a little aside, especially if you don't care\like about all the hacking stuff, but as the show starts you will be sure that, that's just one part, there is plenty of other issues and that's why the show is so involving, I guess. Now i will write the same, i always write, about why is important to give you vote, because in this case this will make the difference between a good show and a great show with more and more positive reviews(from people that actually watch the show, not just ears about it)Every time I do the shows review is because I do believe some shows are more than just good or great, they are imperative to watch, because we cannot pass through life without paying attention to some things that are really worth to be noticed, a lot of rubbish is dumped on TV, but a lot of art is also available, you just have to make a choice, and i really want you to chose this one here MiscellaneousUnpaired symbol: '(' seems to be missing;)",positive
"Rami Maleck is TV's newest obsession in USA's thrilling new techno drama Mr.Robot.With echoes and tones of the Matrix and the best use of voice-over in any film medium in years,Mr Robot debuts incredibly strong and surpassing viewer expectations.The pilot is superbly directed by Niel Arden Oplec who no doubt draws upon his 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' experience, and correctly does so.However,the true winner is Maleck who owns every frame of the 64 minute drama,seducing the audience with his eerie charisma ,which is as addicting as it is captivating.Without apology,his character,Elliot is the show's biggest attraction and the plot is secondary.Nevertheless, the plot is novel,feels fresh and is moving, leaving viewers with lots of unanswered questions,which clearly can only be answered by continued viewer-ship.In the technical department,the cinematography/visual photography is perfectly suited for and enhances the series.The director's choice of dull colors and a combination of bluish tan helps the viewer to see how Elliot perceives the world and is one of the show's better element.And did I mention-it has a killer script? It seems like Suits has found it self a good companion series on USA.In the words of Elliot ""I hope I am not the only one seeing this.""",positive
"It's simply spectacular. From the writers, cast, producer, to the director an amazing job.",positive
"Sam Esmail has created a wonderfully constructed anti-social anti-authoritarian drama piece surrounding the hacking culture. This television show is as much about personal identity as it is about interpersonal relationships and how these individuals choose to interact with or against society.Unfortunately some executive at some level thought it wise to add a narration over the action which ruins the experience. Critical thinking is reduced as facts and feelings are spoon fed to the viewer. I want to watch Mr. Robot and follow alongside the characters and figure things out, not have a disembodied voice spelling things out step by step as they figure it out for themselves.Sam, you've got a hit on your hands. Don't underestimate your audience. Lose the narration. This isn't Idiocracy.",positive
"This was one of my worst experiences whatsoever, a total waste of time. The high scoring (8.8) is too much for this, way too much. This grading system is confusing me, I personally think it deserves a negative 8 - it was so badly thought out. Conversations - boring, characters - boring, plot - boring. I dislike it when they are trying to convince me in the originality of their ideas when, in fact, ""Fight Club"" already showed me a burned out man with a mental disorder fighting against ""society"" in an aggressive manner. What ""Mr.Robot"" couldn't portray (compared to ""Fight Club"") is the realism and the the anger that the characters felt. I see no structure in ""Mr.Robot"", I see modern trends like - social anxiety issues, anti-social behaviour (in a passive behind-a-monitor way), drug use (to make it more original, let's make the character take morphine through the nose, that's never shown in a TV-series before now, has it)and the spin off..oh, man, was it all a hallucination of a young troubled mind? I don't know, may be watch ""Fight Club"" and find out...",negative
"Mr Robot is a great example that when you have a good concept and an idea of what you want to present to the audience, the final product will not fail. The creator Sam Esmail succeeds to deliver a series so complicated and deep as well as interesting and tense.
And if you think it is only about a young and brilliant hacker you would be wrong.
Without any spoilers, I can assure you that this series will transfer you to a world of a very problematic person that has a lot of issues, what is more, they are presented in a so very fascinated way, that you cannot just watch it, but you will dive deep into this reality and become a friend of the protagonist. This is achieved by breaking the fourth wall and having a conversation with the audience itself.
By the end of the series, it will be very difficult for you to say goodbye to one of the best characters ever appeared on the little screen.
The final episode delivers one mesmerizing experience and the most satisfying conclusions in television history.
I dare you to watch it and go through this journey of personal obstacles and milestones.",positive
"How very disappointing... Boring, slow, uninspired. There's nothing left from the promising season 1. I believe I read somewhere online that after season 1's success the director was given full freedom on shooting season 2. The result shows he is incapable to perform without having someone to control and micromanage him. There's no story telling any more and the characters turned blunt.Script and direction is of primary school graduates. This is now an overestimated TV series, which will be easily forgotten. It should have stopped being produced, at least there would be a sweet memory left of a promising TV series. Not going to waste my time watching it any more and as another reviewer mentioned previously ""I am jumping off this train"" too.",negative
"I should have been sleep a half hour ago, but I stayed up to create an account with IMDb just to leave this review. This was the best thing that I've seen on TV ever. it was the perfect blend of fight club, hackers, and the matrix.. minus the special effects, bullet time and the crazy martial arts inspired fight scenes. o.k. maybe its not so much like the matrix. but it definitely has a strong hackers, fight club feel.I'm tempted to come up with a bunch of cool ways to describe the episode, and encourage more people to watch it thereby ensuring the longevity of the series. I really hoped that my first review would have been more altruistic, but this review is selfish in nature. I assume that they must have had the first 6 episodes in the can before releasing the pilot, but I want to find out what happens in the end. the only way that happens is if this show gets really popular, and manages to stay on the air for a few years.But its late, I have to wake up really early, and the other reviews that I've seen are more then accurate. so just do yourself a favor and check it out.",positive
"Hello, friend. I'm being completely honest when i say i originally passed this series off thinking it was a cliche hacking trope show. Which is Ironic as it's the complete opposite and perfectly done by Sam Esmail.I went into it not knowing anything at all about it, didn't even watch a single trailer and all I knew was that Rami Malek was in it. And was i blown away. The idea of seeing a lot of it through the main characters eyes isn't an original one, but was perfect in the setting of this show. Elliot is complex and you don't really know much about him at all- you have to figure out the characters and world yourself to begin with, but then you think, Is this really my opinion of this character? Or is seeing it from elliots POV making me biased? It's completely thought provoking and mind boggling and the extremely believable and real ""dystopian"" reality it's set in is beautiful.Each season is its own treat, but the reveals in the final season were honestly not predictable. in fact the show sets up a lot of the premises as if most of us actually did know something is going on and we figure it out, but much like elliot we choose to suppress it...in a "" it can't be true right?"" sort of mindset and to portray that into a show is magic!The characters are believable and the beauty of the way Esmail has created this world is you find something you love in the 'bad' guys and hate in the 'good' guys because nobody is truly good or bad. (a great moment to say that I LOVE Tyrell Wellick)I would highly recommend giving this show a watch and don't be put off for as long as i was! I'm so glad i finally watched it. Goodbye, my friend.",positive
"I think that the first 2 episodes were brilliant. I really like the theme and the atmosphere. The main character is very interesting and very relatable but he is not the only character i'm interested in. Which is a good thing.I really like when characters speak to themselves,it feels kinda real. In the third episode things started to annoy me. Some very predictable and clichéd choices and some characters were just annoying. Especially one character ,who was very interesting in the first 2 episodes. The plot is smart and it has a great potential. I gave it a 10 because i really enjoyed it ,although it has minor issues. B.G",positive
"The show is about the life of the man who is both hacker in nights and IT technician in days. The main character Eliot has also physiological disorders and not much friends except Angela who dates someone he disliked. Eliot is good at hacking instead of making friends and communicating people and he uses his skill for reveal bad guys' secrets on the internet. Also he have to deal with loneliness that beyond an illness and he is abnormally delusional sometimes. He hates society and he disliked illusions of social media and all fake happiness. Furthermore the thing in the show I loved more is inside voice of the main characters. it reminds me Dexter and his inside and humorist voice and Eliot hold back an item of the his target likewise Dexter's blood samples. Moreover he is just like dexter criminal in nights and normal people in days. Maybe I am exaggerated but the similarities is more than you think. Eliot chooses his target according to some moral codes and he don't give a dame about money too. Another reason why I liked the series more is the purpose of the hacking itself and activist discourse of the hacking group. Also after Mr robot talks Eliot and Eliot mentions about evil corporations, it reminds me Fight Club and culture imperialism. So that TV show has great potential to expand its scope rather than just tells an hacker's life story. For the first episode I extremely enjoy with it and I definitely recommend the show to you. I'm sure that It is worth it for your time instead of other dummy garbage TV operas.",positive
This series has a very special meaning to me. I see myself in the character and the story keeps happening in my head. The actors are really good and the story is very well told. One of the the best tv shows I have ever watched. Rami Malek went crazy on this. A must watch.,positive
"I'll confess I was intrigued by the premise of this show's storyline and after hearing from numerous people it was a great show, I decided to binge watch the 1st season. After having finished watching it I can honestly say the storyline starts out strong, it's compelling and sort of hooks you into wanting to watch the whole story unfold. Sadly, the episodes kind of go off the rails as the viewer is led down a rabbit hole with no way to get back to reality. I saw Remi Malek in the series Pacific, very strange actor, he played that role with a spaced out look too.... there's something about this guy, can't quite put my finger on it, but you honestly believe he's mentally out-of-it... guess that's the sign of a good actor.Having spent the majority of my career in IT, I can tell you a lot of the plot devices used in this story are unrealistic, plenty of technology plot holes you could drive a truck through but if you're not that familiar with tech, then you could buy most of what this series is selling from a ""hacker's perspective"".I thought the series could do less with the graphic depictions of gay sex, those scenes do nothing to advance the plot line and seem very out-of-place. I found it very hard to reconcile the age difference between Elliot and Mr. Robot. In real life, Remi Malex and Christian Slater don't come across as being that far apart in age, so needless to say that plot twist towards the end of the first season was hard to believe. One thing I can say is the filming style was very well done.... I found the odd off-centre depiction of most of the scenes to be strangely compelling.Season 2 will hopefully reconcile a lot of the gaping plot holes from season 1, I'll definitely check it out... but for everybody's who's hailing this series as a 10 out of 10, I suggest you watch Breaking Bad, that series really defined episodic television and set the bar very high, unfortunately this series doesn't hold a candle to the calibre of that show, maybe in Season 2 they'll pull out all the stops.... we'll see... 7 out of 10.... I already gave my 10 out of 10 to Breaking Bad",positive
"I was looking for something new, something fresh, and of course, within my taste . I like the lone-type hero main character, that doesn't go focus other characters more than necessary.I checked the ""most popular TV-show"" link and checked the plots of each of them and among all of those selection, the one that stick out was Mr. Robot.I'm a bit of a techy and idolized those that are most familiarized with them. They create and solve. And sure enough, Mr. Robot feature someone like it.Being as society calls them geeks with buck teeth, and social problems, I was expectant of that for our main character here. His name is Eliot (hope that is spelled right). He has issues but is portrayed as powerful in his skills. But contrary to the usual geek vs geek plot, here, they show us the ability of Eliot can be used in many ways we wouldn't have guessed.As characters are introduced or focused in his problems, each of them would be subjected. I tell you, you wouldn't want to be one of Eliot's subject 'cause every privacy you have would be out. Secrets of that person would be found out and for what I perceived, this secrets can be a dark one, little or big. And when you cross him, you would get what you deserved, this is according to his moral code and as of yet, I am still with his moral goodness. It seems alright.If I had this abilities, I would do what he did in those circumstances, perhaps... Anyway, it kinds of resembles a superhero in our normal society just like doctors go battling for their patients lives, soldiers battling their wars, and teachers educating children, Eliot battle corporates, killers, murders in his own way.",positive
"This TV show picked the 2nd most ambitious topic in the world (world order, how is it set in place, how and why it collapses and what happens after), but story and reasoning are so shallow, linear and naive. In short, show took basic concept of the Fight Club and made it moronic. Casting is very wrong. To begin with, Rami Malek (Eliot) is 9 years older than Charly Chaikin (Darlene), who should be his older sister. Why pick 35 years old (who looks as 35 years old) to act as if he is 28 and 24 years old girl acting as woman in early 30s?! That pretty much ruined the experience for me. Once again, there is nothing original in choice and development of characters. Best hacker in the world is Chinese transvestite (how original), 2nd best is crazy genius, schizophrenic, with split personality disorder and on morphine (in this universe, person like that would be able to carry on genius work, extremely dysfunctional and not able to survive outside of the hospital and certainly not somebody to manage regular job + secret organization including controlling EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY in that organization and even figure out how to pull the plug from the establishment ruling the world). Furthermore, Fsociety is constituted of black man, Muslim woman, fat man and girl who looks like a porn star (so we have all ""minorities"" here), as opposed to ""Evil Corp"" represented with regular family type white men (THIS CONCEPT IS ACTUALLY OPPOSITE TO SMART AND ORIGINAL - THIS IS SO TRIVIAL THAT I WANT TO CRY!). Tyrell Wellick is supposed to be the anti-hero but he or it is basically just a bunch of clichés piled up with no reasoning or anything at all in the background. Naturlich, guy is European and Aryan - HOW ORIGINAL, bravo! Very ambitious and very rubbish TV show.",negative
MUST WATCH. This is the tv show what we should call tv show.,positive
"What in the Heck happened to Season 2?? The first season got me hooked... and now the writer has just taken us down one dark rabbit hole after another...It's not even the same show. I'm currently so annoyed by Season 2 that I'm writing a review about it instead of watching the new episode. I would have NEVER done that in first season. Boyfriend feels same... so I had to read what others on here had to say, and I find I'm not alone in my opinion. What the hell happened??? I'll still finish the season... because I'm committed like that. But not sure if I'll spend my time on Season 3.I feel like I learned quite a bit about the tech world in the first season, which I enjoyed being 'schooled' and having to Google terms to fully grasp all conversations between characters... but Season two is about nothing but convincing audience of the severity of Elliot's drug addiction and mental illness. I get it, I believe he's f*cked up, let's move on with a plot... it's like nothing is happening. Good characters got cut (i.e. Shayla and Gideon) and mediocre characters have more screen time... more new characters are coming in for no apparent connection... it just seems to me that the writer himself has a drug and mental illness problem and is projecting it into the show.",positive
"In addition to being a very realistic series within your reach within the hacker world, it brings a stark innovation, the series manages to arrest you, captivate you with each episode, you really get attached to the story, characters, live the drama, the immersion is absurd, every season the triggers come back, it is an extremely intelligent and well thought out series with all its simplicity. Excellent actress and actors, sensational protagonist.
A series of these will miss you a lot, many of them.Goodbye My friend.",positive
"I love the performance of Rami Malek.
I hope to see him in another series with
A respectable director",negative
"I have seen 5 episodes up to know and Eliot seems to have a real problem with men. He hasn't liked a single man he has met on the show. He flinches when a man goes near him or touches him, but he doesn't mind women touching him. It is starting to get on my nerves how he treats women, like they're all lovely and innocent and treats all men like evil potential threats.It may come out later a reason for this but I just think maybe it is the writers or the shows creator who are man haters, it is really spoiling the show for me because I do love the show and the hacking story lines, and the revolution against a corrupt society.",positive
"My first impression of Mr. Robot is simply that it is a Great Show, Originally, being an ethical hacker myself, I was skeptical as to the show being not only accurate but captivating in a way that wasn't stereotypical or made me feel as if I had seen it ten times before. Instead, I was delighted to find that I was so completely wrong! The show enriches itself with (some) accuracy, and has a certain breaking bad, man-of-few-words feel to it; with many complex emotions being expressed subtly. The only thing that I can't get past with this show is the name. Though it IS being marketed to mainstream audiences, a small part of me can't stand that such an extraordinary show that strives to deviate from the norm with these conspiracy-types would have a name that suggests just the opposite. Other than this, the show features brilliant acting and character development. I can't wait for the next episode!",positive
I know I should love this show as it is ambitious and tries hard to be original but i could never quite get into it that much as I felt there was something missing that I could not quite put my finger on. The soundtrack is one of the best of all time and the directing is great. It has its moment of brilliance especially eps3.4_runtime-error.r00 which was presented as a continuous shot and episode 405 Method Not Allowed of which I was so engaged I didn't even notice the lack of dialogue. The show started off decent and finished nicely but a lackluster season 2 and a slow starting season 3 brought the overall quality of the show down.,negative
"The show feels really unoriginal. It is eerily similar to Dexter with a few other common tropes thrown in, filled with monologues seemingly attempting to replicate the hate towards the world of an angsty teenager.",negative

It's more than series. It's an experience.. the best show ever .. hats off Elliot.. love u,positive
"Mr.Robot is currently the best thing to watch on T.V. Rami Malek and Christian Salter's acting is just pure class,every scene in which they are together gives me goosebumps ""literally"".I'll admit that some parts other than their screen time are sometimes boring but all shows these days have those flaws. People claim that it's nothing but a rip off of classic movies and shows;so what?They are gathering up all the good stuff and jumbling them up to make a Masterpiece!",positive
"I love love love this series. The writing, the story lines and the acting are all excellent. Folks who are technology-oriented are especially likely to enjoy this show. I appreciate the smart writing and the plot twists and surprises. The characters are well-written and fully developed by creator and writer Sam Esmail. Rami Malek, relatively unknown before this series, excels at portraying the brooding and fascinating main character. Sometimes the psychological drama is very dark but it has a specific purpose and the viewer is rewarded in the end. I enjoy this series more than any I've seen in recent years and I can't wait for Season 2.",positive
"Why don't I love this show? Why don't I love this show?There is something about it...Oh wait- Esmail (the show's creator) stole the plot from Fight Club along with countless other snippets from Kubrick movies (just to name a couple victims).I don't care about originality (my score for the show says this much), remakes bother me on most occasions but saying a film like say, Avatar sucks because it's unoriginal, I don't feel that way.Mr. Robot takes things a step further, it just steals so much from so many places. I've just never seen such blatant disregard for other peoples work because of how much of other peoples stuff Esmail used.Had it been just one plot point from Fight Club and a few Kubrickan things every episode, that would have been fine. But no, Mr. Esmail took so much more. The fact that Stanley Kubrick and Fight Club never won a Golden Globe but Mr. Esmail did is evidence of the so called golden age of televisions demise. I'm calling it, Mr. Robot is the beginning of the end of the golden age of TV. Game of Thrones has only a few more seasons left. They are rebooting countless shows. Mad Men, Breaking Bad is over. It's done folks. It's saturated.I digress, So what if Esmail was the first one to bring realistic computer hacking in anyway shape or form to Hollywood. So what if Malek and Slater's roles are two of the best I've ever seen on TV, plagiarism is plagiarism. Everyone steals from everyone, right? Right. I've just never seen this much taken and this much reward and praise given to the taker. What Mr. Esmail did is metaphorically pull of the greatest jewelry heist in history. No one is questioning his genius, even though it's over 50% stolen. He went in with a mask and took it all. Golden Globes and all. The worst part it no one stopped him or even questioned him. Do I need to list everything he stole? I could and it would be astounding but I don't have time. Does that leave me just another jealous and lonely SOB ranting on the internet? Is the proof not self evident? Do you see what he has stolen?I know I'm saying this show is the beginning of the end of the golden age of TV but that's not really what's important here. What's important is how everyone is letting Esmail stand on the shoulders of giants like Kubrick and authors like Palahniuk and be treated as a genius. I'm particular pointing the finger at you IMDb users, whom voted this so highly and especially at the Hollywood Foreign press and SXSW film festival and last but not least, critics.",positive
"Unfortunately for me, I knew what this story was about within the first or second episode. A lot of shows are essentially a TV movie, that being the content of the first two episodes completing two hours of entertainment. After that it's a lot of meandering with the emotional involvement of secondary characters that don't matter to us or the story. Mr. Robot was no different.All I was saying to myself during certain beats in all the episodes was ""Tyler Durden, Tyler Durden"". The drugs in the story were a dead give away and his stoic essence hiding a deep seeded anger was the other. But the real kicker is not just being a rip off of Fight Club. Even the cinematography was Fight Club. Not only that but it goes after the whole motif of big corp and big debt.Unfortunately all the characters are worthless except for the main character. He manages to find compassion from the audience through his stoic behavior and inability to physically defend himself or choosing to never use a gun, a truly pathetic ideal as if that was proving something.The technology storyline was pretty well done, but find their outs were often over simplified and boring. Writers are lazy in Hollywood because they are hired because they know someone, not because they understand procedural writing. It's the hardest writing you can do, but if you take the job, don't blow it. Often they provide so many obstacles and the way out is picking a lock or someone showing up just in time. So boring.Hacking is the next big thing to threaten America. It's been lying in wait for a very long time and the day will come when someone attempts to cut off all debt ties between banks and the middle class. We know that is the big and central issue of the scam of the American Dream. We know that enslavement exists because our minds can never be free of the worry of the next meal and its all due to materialism. It's a great topic, but this exploration was an outright rip off and lazy through the first season and no different in the second.Philosophically, it went down an interesting road we all need to be more aware of and that is debt. That is our enemy and we need to acknowledge it more and more. But find your own identity, don't ripoff someone else's. You can use the same motif, but find a different setting and mechanism that explores the mind of someone who is trying to find his life and get it back.",positive
"*Spoilers - first three episodes*I had high hopes for this series after the pilot. It promised an interesting protagonist and a clash of corporate vs hacker world. All of this collapses in the second and third episodes. The character development of the main protagonist is odd. He started out with an interesting life philosophy (the scene in the pilot with the psychiatrist) that since hasn't gone anywhere. There is just ad nauseam repetition of him being paranoid and awkward. I still have no idea who he is and what he wants, or what his problems really are. Other than sexual preference, there is also no character development for any of the other characters neither.All of this might have been overlooked if the story was interesting, but there again, nothing is happening. There's a group of hackers, an evil corp...and that's about it. The plot at this point (or how little of it there is) is getting buried under a mess of shallow scenes with no clear destination. It feels like the creators haven't fleshed out their characters and don't have enough material to make a compelling story.",positive
"1st season is a roller coaster!!! If you can, just watch the first season and be satisfied. Second season..... snore. I mean most show fizzle out, but this one crashed and burned with pointless side story lines. Couldn't finish it sadly.",negative
"It was a revelation when I first saw that it is possible to make TV that is better than most movies. That was Breaking Bad. I am really glad to find that this has been done again with Mr Robot. The storytelling, the cast, nearly everything is reaching to the new highs.It is not without flaws. I noticed I absolutely loved season 2, while the 3rd season was a little of a disappointment. When I viewed the series again, I saw how the Tyrell Wellick character/actor did not quite match the top-notch performances of the rest of the cast; next to the beautifully subdued performances by the mega stars Rami Malik and Christian Slater, it was clear the actor performing the role of TW did not master the subtleties, the commandment of the scene with his presence, leaving a bad taste of trying a little too hard to be noticed, rather than simply staying on the background as a supporting actor. On the second viewing, I ended up fast forwarding most scenes with Mr. Wallick. God I hope he'll no be appearing on S4.",positive
"I started watching this as a person who is quit into technology and i loved it immediately, the main character Elliot is very like-able and you understand his problems very quickly. The story line in season one is, complicated but simple enough to understand.Each Episode you learn something major and it seems like its set in stone, you create a view on it, but then next episode it changes, this program really makes you think. I enjoyed it a lot i loved season one but in season two it started to get even more complicated, this is fine for me as i love that sort of stuff, but it does get a bit much at times. Overall i think the only way or you to know i its or you is to give it a try, this programme is so complicated that you can kind o make it your own, so give it a try",positive
Each seasons just gets better than the last and the final episode of season four is as good as any LSD trip I have ever had. But I still can not work out who Elliot is.,positive
"This show hit a bit of a lull in Season 2 as they introduced many new characters and subplots. Perhaps they felt that they needed more. The cinematography is incredible! Finally...a show that pushes the envelope both, with content and shot selection. People in the future will use this show as the watershed moment when TV evolved!",positive
"Everybody steals - and I don't see the problem with this show being a Frankenstein of good ideas done in the past. ""Fight Club/Kubrick/Shyamalan did it first!"" doesn't matter to the new generations enjoying this, and I don't know why it should. Many movies have dated badly and are products of their time, and without permission to steal, all of their ideas and experimentation would remain in the past. But this series never succeeds in stringing these parts together, in order to achieve greatness - is simply a mess. I'm ashamed to say I secretly watched the entirety of the first season, and much of season two. Not because I liked the show, but because of Elliot Alderson, a person anyone with a family history of severe mental illnesses can relate to. I say ""ashamed"" because I actually hated the show in and of itself. So much of it makes me cringe, and I'm not just talking about the monologues. No, almost every plot twist was either incredibly easy to predict, or they threw me off because of how ridiculous they were. So many of them just sent the plot progression and character development back to square one, making it very clear that the time spent on leading you on was simply wasted. ""Haha, she was his sister all along! Be confused and frustrated along with Elliot, because you just wasted hours of your life being lead on and thinking it would be something else entirely!""The acting ranges from bad to brilliant, but the script and plot are so ridiculous that you don't know who to blame. What exactly is Tyrell supposed to mean? What is his incompetence trying to get across? His kinky psycho wife?These references(American Psycho with Tyrell, Breaking Bad with Shayla, etc.) can all coexist in the same series, but they need to be coherent, and they need to either drive the plot, or stay subtly in the background. It is possible to do, but it requires better planning than what the show has, and it requires consistency and respect for the main storyline. You can't just play out the plot lines inspired by brilliance for the sake of it, and then drop them again, and expect people to think that this is greatness, this is art.Rami Malek sometimes has a problem with over acting, but because of the direction and the script, I don't blame him. In fact, I have no idea what this actor is doing on this show, because he acts and looks like exactly what he is supposed to be, all the time. I sometimes forgot that he wasn't real, because his realistic immaturity and frequent mistakes do not belong on a show like this, at all. I wish there wasn't so much explaining going on in his monologues(""I am insane, do you get it? I'm a schizo! Now I feel this, and that - this is why I am scared right now!""). But then again, if the show wasn't trying so hard to make you ""get it"", I maybe wouldn't have realised why this character is so deplorably done.Many people have tried to play armchair psychologist, not realising that his suffering is only a cynical marketing ploy - he is not meant to be understood. While the narration of the protagonist would have you believe that he is so severely socially inept that he'll never understand the basic rules of social interaction, he comes across as merely shy and paranoid when shown actually talking to people. He also doesn't have any other autistic traits to speak of - safe for his fear of touch - yet the show keeps making you think ""aspergers!"", because that is the fashionable syndrome of the moment, and it knows that everyone likes to think they get it. The show also has fun with psychosis, multiple personality disorder and depression in the exact same way. This is ""Mental Illnesses are Fascinating and Entertaining"" - the show! It keeps throwing random disorders at you, not because it wants to give an accurate portrayal of what they are actually like, but to ensure one ridiculous twist after another. I hate this. I absolutely loathe it. Everyone is trying to analyse Elliot, but the show itself clearly couldn't care less about the illnesses they are exploiting for entertainment - Elliot was never created to be coherent or authentic, he is only there as a vessel to always feel bad in a way that creates the most tragedy-inducing situations possible. So very smart of the producers to hire a good psychologist in the creation of this character - he may not be completely authentic, but he is authentic enough. His personality traits and actions themselves always add up, and you believe everything about his stunted demeanour and the way he talks. But it is only to ensure you check in for the next episode, where you can marvel at him losing grip on reality once again.I find it hilarious that the most universally sympathetic trait of Elliot, is how much he wants to break free of these ridiculous twists and the stupid world he lives in. He alternates between looking confused, sad, exhausted and paranoid, which is exactly what you are going to feel watching Mr. Robot from beginning to end. You are also going to feel hope, because you suddenly see something incredibly well done, and then you are going to lose it and become jaded, because it never lasts or works out in the end. Like Elliot, staring psychotically ahead as he enters a new disaster, the only thing we can all know for sure, is how bad it is going to be.",negative
"The writing, the acting, cinematography, direction etc. It's all brilliant. I heard about this show and was completely uninterested. It was until my friend raved non stop forcing me to watch it. I watched the first episode and i was hooked. It is simply marvellous and i would recommend to anyone who loves mind blowing tv. This show will make you think about the society we live in and question what kind of person you are, helps you better yourself. But most importantly it's constant realistic yet mind boggling plot twists will make you absolutely addicted and obsessed about this amazing show,",positive
Best feeling of trying to understand what is going on throughout each and every episode.By far the best show I've ever watched.More than highly recommended.,positive
"Just finished the final season of Mr Robot!
Got to say that HANDS DOWN this is the best series I've ever watched!! I mean all of them! Sam Esmail you're a genius! Total masterpiece, especially more so once you've watched the finale which is just a beautiful culmination of the whole story. Beautifully written & imaginative.",positive
"First off - for all the people that are ranting its $%£* because its technically inaccurate or has sweeping generalisations - they just don't get it. the show is about a dysfunctional but gifted security programmer/coder by day and disenfranchised hacktivist by night. he has difficulty maintaining relationships and can only really get close to people by hacking/invading their lives. he has a therapist and a uses drugs to cope with his reality. the tone and feel of the pilot is very striking an sets up the story very well. If you are not interested in social problems, computing, social media etc you will probably not like this, I'd say give it a try anyway. Christian Slater's appearance is a welcome one as the other protagonist/mentor/illusion? the show tries to highlight our increasingly digitalised age and the technobubble in which people have wrapped themselves in in order to escape or avoid their reality(y'know the peeps that live on FB TWtr Snpcht like they can't stand to be in their own bodies!) and at times your not sure if what you are seeing is a delusion on the part of the main character (Elliot). Again for all the people screaming about how bad it is - there has to be sweeping generalisations and some dumbing down of the tech language and explanations otherwise you'd be left with a narrative that speaks to 1% of the population in short - go and Hatewatch something else! I truly hope this show lives up to the promise of the pilot and our antihero succeeds in his quest.",positive
This is absolutely amazing show! It's breathtaking! All actors are great!,positive
"I saw rave reviews for this and thought I would give it a try.Unlike most shows that start slow and take time to get into, this one is kind of the opposite. It starts out fairly quick with lots of promise, but then just drags with no real payoff.By the second episode I predicted the ""Fight Club"" ripoff regarding Christian Slater's character. I literally said ""he's not there and/or he's the main character's father"". Bingo. I kept expecting something big to happen, but it never did. Everything was slow and the main character couldn't get more monotone if he tried.The acting otherwise is very good, good basic lighting and great camera angles. But there just was no ""ooomph"" to this at all. I found myself nearly falling asleep for quite a few episodes.This show seems to mirror very much the current American anti-generation movement going on with the Millennials vs Boomers (which interestingly ignores the most important and influential generation alive - Generation X). This sort of thing has been around since human history began, as each generation rebels against the ones that come before it (It's a survival mechanism, nothing more). You will note that most of the ""good guys"" are young, and the ""evil guys"" are old.But because of all this, I just found the show to progressively get slower and weaker every season, which is the opposite of most shows I like.I guess if you like slow dramas, this is your thing; I know lots of people that like that genre and I've never understood it.",positive
"Sam esmail created a masterpiece, and the season 4 was brilliant, in some episodes my brain was frying.",positive
"Having watched the first episode hopes were high to have found a new favorite TV series to watch. Sadly the second episode went faster to a 0 than the Greek credit rating.From needless and non-credible dialog to an action deprived boring slur life of a junkie this series has quickly waned my interest. Where the pilot episode left me wanting more with real moral choices and illegal yet so right action, the second episode was just and endless chain of boredom.Hopefully the show will make either a turn to the light or the dark side of the various choices that lay ahead, otherwise I see no reason to keep watching.",negative
"Thank you, Sam. Made an account just to give this a 10.",positive
"Spoiler free review: Mr Robot is legitimately brilliant. Rarely have I seen a show which so perfectly works its arc through from start to finish and demands to be re-watched within a new context. Far more than what you might consider to be a show about hackers. Dynamite performances throughout, some of the best writing/directing to grace the screen and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. Cannot rate this series highly enough.",positive
The show is well made and the acting excellent. Eventually you realize the plot is the most beautifully planned and executed writings of any TV show every made.,positive
"I have watched 3 episodes now and the more i watch the more vile and empty feel. The lead character is meaningless. This is no tale of robin hood he and the main characters are a reflection of our debauchery and self obsession of the disempowered and alone, they are no different than the so called evilcorp they battle against. I hope this doesn't go any further as a series as it deepens the well of our suffering. We all want to kick it against the man but this series makes us as bad as them for right or for wrong.I can hardly tell a word he says and the only relief in all this emptiness is angela. I will watch one more episode to see what happens next and then stop. The worst series since Caprica.",negative
"Awesome show and had a Dexter (althought not as good) feel to it. Good acting and plenty of suspense. My only knock on it is the annoying, loud, weird, loud, and again loud background music or soundtrack. I was constantly tending to the volume throughout the series! It was completely unnecessary and WAY OVER THE TOP!",positive
"I only made it half way through the second episode of the first season and it took all I could to suspend disbelief enough to get that far. I can't believe that this show gets as many positive reviews as it does. It's like a movie made for 12 year olds, if that. Are people so divorced from reality or are they so hungry for a geek fantasy that they will put up with this type of farce? The way that corporations are displayed and how upper management acts and how employees relate to each other is all off the chart silly. The idea that some IT guy can bring down the world or that there is some Coney Island stealth group working to do that is just dumb. The plot that some young, mentally ill, drug addict IT guy is so smart and valuable the biggest corporation will do anything to get him to work for them is laughable. The ridiculous things are endless like the cheating husband's dog being taken by Eliot, having the caring drug dealer neighbor, having girls naked left and right wanting Eliot with no effort on his part, having a client trying to save his therapist in her personal life, that 11 lawyers who did nothing were at some meeting with the big wig of E Corp and Eliot and then ordered to walk out as if they were some props which they were, that Eliot the world's greatest hacker sits around snorting morphine and not injecting it, that Eliot is a world class genius everyone wants, the scene where the DDOS attack occurred was hokey, just about every single Eliot hacking scene is not believable, the E Corp guys riding around like the secret service. On and on and on. The show is a cartoon and completely divorced from real life at every level (relationships, hacking, corporations, IT departments, morality, drugs, white collar workers, the WHOLE PLOT, etc.). Watching Marvel or Bugs Bunny is more realistic than this garbage.",negative
"Season 2, in my opinion, has been skyrocketing to infinite. This has been an insane show. Every episode has something completely original to offer in season2. I think the people that do not like the second season aren't so happy with change happening in their shows, that's understandable, but with a massively psychological show like this, you're bound for some serious variety. I think they should expect that. In the pilot I could tell that the show would at least EVENTUALLY get weird. and I COULDN'T WAIIT!! I'm just glad it did. I hope it gets weirder. Because it's also super mundane and straight at times, I can't get enough of that, and I know dozens of fans that feel the same way. Keep it up writers!!! Remember, your biggest fans don't usually write reviews. We have no words for our love.I do understand the frustration from certain people, they're used to consistency, as well as other genres I think. But they're not seeing how this shows variety blends into itself so perfectly. I can't possibly disagree with the direction it's taken. I started to re-watch this show after the 3rd episode of Season 2, because it has been such a wicked ride.Before the spoilers, I will say (although so damn needless to say) THE ACTING!!!!!!! WHAT?!??!?! THEEE ACCTTINNGG!!! However, I do remember taking longer to figure out Angela's character during the pilot than I took to figure the others. She turned out amazing, and I could see her perfection when I rewatched the pilot recently.I'll get specific now so there will be suggestive spoilage and some direct spoilers from here on... That sixth episode of Season2. HOW BOLD!!!!!! I didn't care how long that sitcom part was because it was written so terrifically. Although yes, every time the segment continued I laughed in a love-hate frustration, it was mind blowing. beyond genius. They pulled that off because it was so incredibly life-like, as in realistically dream-like. Good job guys, that was fascinating.They must have pre-planned the whole story start to finish already. Because it's unfolding in an immeasurably perfect way. It's contrasting with itself in such an impossibly beautiful manner. I don't even understand my own emotions after I watch this stuff. It's like a religion now (jk Elliot)",positive
"After a promising pilot episode the series falls into a loop of unimportant scenes and unnecessary hacks just to make Eliott's capabilities clear to us. The characters make senseless decisions to force the plot forward, leaving behind ideals that seemed to be deeply ingrained in themselves (especially Angela). In short, an entertaining and interesting plot with a script with many holes, unconvincing dialogue and empty characters. The result is like cooking a gourmet restaurant dish with the ingredients you have in the fridge.",negative
"This series are one of the best series on the world. Elliot was like me and im like elliot, lost.",positive
"There's simply no logic in these series, I've seen the entire first season without knowing well what's going on.The main character is too much dramatic, to the point his acting gets really unconfortable to watch.It does explore some modern themes, which I think is the reason why it became so popular, but I don't recommend it to anyone. Waste of time.",negative
"I have created an account with IMDb today because I am in shock that Mr Robot is only just in the top 100 for TV Shows... This must be a mistake with IMDb's database because It has to be top 5 at least! Mr Robot is quite simply; brilliant. The only way to explain it is that it is like if Fight Club (Film) and Twin Peeks (TV Show) had an extremely clever and topical love child. It is truly second to second entertainment that never lets up. The characters are acted perfectly, the story telling is fascinating and a thrill ride that you will never predict, and most of all like no other series before it makes you want to dedicate a wall in your office to investigate and understand the story fully with charts and time-lines like some sort of obsessed detective in a gritty cop drama.It is mind blowing and truly one of the best series ever created. I beg of you to watch it and give it a chance as you will not be let down, I can guarantee it!",positive
A series with good actors but a story where you quickly fall asleep.,negative
Quite a nice series. Was surprised to see Christian slater - have not seen him since 'The broken arrow'. Crisp and smart dialogue. A bit cheesy and overboard sometimes with the 'To be' CTO of Evil corp punching a homeless man to death to vent of his frustration. I don't think there is any series running that has the same potential as this one. Rami Malek has given a very good performance of a lonely genius who is very disturbed and who sees the world for what it is. The rest of the characters are only loosely bounded with some sticking out starkly. Hopefully the writers brisk them up in the future episodes. It might not deserve the 9+ it currently has but certainly amongst the top 5 shows on air. Can not help noticing the fact that the idea is based on 'Fight club' with probably the entire character of Christian slater ending up as a figment of our heroes imagination based on his fathers memory.,positive
"Review after completing all episodes.The pilot was great, sense of fresh air and stylish start. Nice show with good pacing, story, characters,performances, stylish music, dark type.from first itself i knew it was inspired by Fight club, a fight club for the current modern setting.. But very disappointed in the last few episodes to find out that it's a direct rip off from fight club.. I was watching it with great interest and suddenly I felt why am I watching this !Upto 5 episodes stuff will be great and then the show will start showing its true colors. The Story could have easily been taken in some other direction, instead they chose to copy Fight club straight of the bat.",negative
I started watching this show due to the high rating on IMDb. After the 1st episode I was thinking they finally did a great show that will have huge success. But shortly after the 2nd episode the show went very quick from great to worst you can imagine. From a skillful hacker movie to a sloppy soap telenovela.It became off topic comparing to the 1st episode. For example if you are a fan of hacker movies consider watching Whoami - No System is Safe. It's a German film from 2014 who will not disappoint you.I don't think Mr. Robot can be fixed after going so far in the wrong direction. Too bad.,negative
"9.1 rating on IMDb? Really?This show's pilot was very, very good.The acting throughout has been good. The production has been excellent. Unfortunately the story lost it's way after about episode 4. That is the writers and directors fault. It has quickly become as tedious as the second series of True Detective (Don't start me on that - I could follow the plot(just). But it was very, very dull in comparison to the excellent first series.)The 9.1 rating must be taking into account the people who voted(on the whole series) after watching one or two episodes. Its OK but we are rating this show alongside the Wire, Sopranos, House of Cards, Dexter, Justified and Boardwalk Empire. And they're just the American dramas!This review has admittedly turned into a moan about the IMDb ratings and not the actual show. Sorry about that but I do, in some part, plan my TV and movie viewing around the reviews on this site. That's the whole point isn't it? People shouldn't be voting on TV SERIES/SEASONS until they are a good way into the finished productThe show is OK to good. Definitely worth a look.But 9.1 ????",positive
This show has an 8.6 but I still think its underrated. Absolutely amazing story telling and is just a show you have to watch for yourselves. Season 4 is absolutely incredible.,positive
I have just seen the pilot episode of the series and my review is based on it. The show features a socially reserved guy who is hacker by passion and an IT Network security guy by profession. He has an urge to bring some change in the world but feels his lone efforts are not enough. Then comes the twist where he meets a stranger who offers him a chance to join him in their underground mission to bring equality in the world. I am quite intrigued by the pilot episode and very interested to see what the show has in offering. It is not that age old boring hacking stuff which we normally watch in commercial movies. Acting wise it seems good and lead Rami Malek has done fantastic job. It is promising start but will wait for series to unfold till then I would give it 8/10.,positive
"One of the best TV series ever made ever.... Just wow, you have to watch it..... damn",positive
"Look.I started watching this show in roughly August 2016 and when I did, I stumbled upon a TV show that was slick, smart and had a brilliant, twisty-turny plot. It was revolutionary to me. I had never been exposed to something that was so thoughtfully written that combined some serious intellectual tings like criticism of consumerism and the power pyramid of society alongside the mundane details of hacking, of everyday relationships, of struggles at work and home. I'm not saying that there was not perhaps a forerunner, but to me this was the real McCoy. I left that season elated and in a state of glee. The disenfranchised male hacker voice I did not particularly ascribe to but I loved the show for being so bold and bloody well put together. The twists man!!!! I never saw them coming. There were moments so well shot and planned out and acted and written I could just feel it inscribing itself into my very self. If you watch something as iconic as some of those scenes, it just moves you. Stays with you. The first season is that for me. Sure it's not perfect but it's near as heck to me and I would give it as a template to any future network, filmmaker, actor or anyone who would listen to my rambling diatribes (like the one now at 1 AM).But it left on a cliffhanger. Such a brilliant cliffhanger that the entire 3 bloody other seasons couldn't bloody pay up on it. It left you with hope and anticipation of what was to come, the reality of Mr Robot's machinations finally having slammed home on Elliot and he powerless beneath it but swept in the tide of the revolution he began. Brilliant stuff. Sam Esmail was proved a revolutionary filmmaker that day in my opinion and I would advise 1000% for anyone and everyone to watch the show up to that point.It was only in season 2 that the narrative became less slick, more disjointed. It finally achieved some kind of endgame in the final 2-ish episodes that satisfied some kind of need I had had percolating since the ending of season 1. The scene with Darlene in the police station at the end still chills me, as does the brutal murder of her boyfriend beforehand. However, after a strong initial episode of season 3, the narrative then spins again in a thousand different unfulfilling directions and Christ alive. I judge a show based on the memory and feeling I attach to it in reflection, and I can't even remember what the heck happened. I just remember walking away from every episode thinking ""now they'll do it now they'll build up to something and release it"" and inevitably leaving disappointed but still clutching to the few straws of a decent plot or twist Mr Esmail would graciously drip-feed us.But I had hope. I still had so much darn hope. Oh god. I waited like 2 years. You don't understand. And then the season began and lemme tell you it finally seemed CONCISE and like they were getting somewhere. Like at some indiscriminate point they'd turn tail and finally unleash the same level of brilliance and tone of season 1. I still had hope. But then 11 episodes in and I realised all of my hopes were banking on two hours of the final episodes. And as those episodes wore on to no fitting or satisfying conclusion of any kind my hope turned to disappointment and then rage. I had dedicated years to this and THAT was the endgame?! What was the point of the whole hacker thing?! I get the fact that he was mentally unstable and it's driving force behind the plot but like. God dude. I don't want to sound like one of those hoi polloi who y'all film people say ""don't understand the plot"" but the whole USP of this show is that he is a HACKER doing HACKER THINGS plus has got some dissociative identity disorder related to childhood trauma (human heart of the show) that fuels him on. The final seasons did focus on his mental state a lot more - which was fascinating and honestly I could shake Esmail's hand as it was wonderfully done - but the final episodes and seasons seemed to hurl the whole concept of the 5/9 hack out of the window like garbage and fsociety too. Such brilliant concepts squandered and wasted.I think what really broke me was that crowbarred in were clips of the first season and my god were they so much better than what was offered now. I kept having thoughts like ""hey that was such a cool scene!"" and then immediately ""oh yeah that was ages ago."" Even the way the actors delivered their lines was different then. It boggles the mind.I am so furious right now about this lacklustre and frankly pointless ending that I have no idea what to do with myself. Esmail is a great visionary filmmaker but he needs some poor guy to rein him in. Sweet Jesus. This show could have been so amazing and I can only mourn for what was lost as I don't think another show could come close to the majesty of the first series. I am unsurprised why the ratings have gone down since season 1 and only mourn that my obsession took hold so quick. Rami and my other bois and all of the BRILLIANT scenes chucked around throughout the 4 seasons like a broken patchwork quilt deserved far better.I do not intend to go into show business but I might as bloody well just to smack Esmail around the jaw, frogmarch him to an undisclosed location and demand what in God's name he was THINKING when he wrote some of that garbage around what was frankly the bare beautiful bones of one of the most potentially epic series of all time. What was he thinking?!?! God bless I've lost my mind. Last episode came out on my birthday and dear god I have been broken.Worst birthday present ever: your hopes and dreams will always be shattered when invested in something you love",negative
Everything was great. I enjoyed it immensely.Excellent actors.Very beautiful and engaging story.,positive
It just don't require any review all the episodes are perfect 10.,positive
"What a Show! I am proud of the moment when i decided to watch this series. The first episode laid out the premise pretty clearly (or so i thought). On one side, super nerdy and smart hacker(s) rebelling against the tyranny of the controlling giants of the world. Right people with the right tools Vs. wrong people with all the power. Great enough for me to spend my time.Mr. Robot features some nice close-to-real hacker ways and tricks. Intelligent and meaningful conversations and protagonist interacting through the fourth wall. Oh how thrilling this is! Just the type of show that matters to me.Now that I am writing this after the end of the first season, it makes me think... Of the plot, of the characters, of the theme and of good and bad. Initially the story seemed to me, plain and simple, right vs. wrong. But most often, 100 out 100 times, right and wrong isn't so binary. There are right people doing the right things in all the wrong ways. So are wrong people using the right ways to do the wrong things. In reality, there isn't a clear demarcation between black and white. And the creators have deeply considered it while making the show. It shows clearly in their characters. All fighting their ways through strength and weakness, amidst clouds of dilemma and flashes of clarity.The protagonist Elliot (played by Sam, the creator of the show), is a deeply complex but REAL character. Just like any other human being. He feels lonely, is sad by the sad things of the world. He is just in nature and expresses his sympathy for the blindness in the world. He tries to set things right on his level but, just like the rest of us, has his own demons to fight against. He is on drugs, he hacks deep into the privacy of others, but still in his core is the 'best person I know' as pointed out by a fellow character. I insist everyone to find time for this genius of a show. This will engage you in on multiple levels. This will make you think a lot of so many things. Or even just for the sheer pleasure of watching some good film-making. You will not be disappointed.I give it a full bar. 10/10.Cheers. :)",positive
"Kudos to the director, all the creators, writers and actors of this show. I don't know how to describe it but its definitely different from all the current TV series i tried to watch.The 'human drama' in it is intertwined with drug addition, capitalism, the dark side of technology and corruption - and the plot shows how it can affect the interaction & behavior of the characters in the story. For me, that blend of harsh social reality mixed with a good storytelling is what makes this show stand out from the rest.Mr. Robot may not be a show for everyone.. but if you are looking for a new TV series that can tap the inner intellectual being in you - then this is a show that you shouldn't miss.",positive
"Exciting and heartbreaking and satisfying
Rami is a great actor
He starred in the seventh episode
I can only wait for next week",positive
"As noted, the pilot was epic! Brilliant really. You have to just flow with this show and it will hit. The only other actor I could see that would come close to Rami Malek might be Wentworth Miller. Rami Malek is just brilliant. No questions asked. He is so inside this character you can't believe this isn't really him. That's incredible acting as an art form. There is a some really deep ideas presented in this show. The writing is high IQ. How about Elliott's first session with his therapist. The social commentary is spot on. What we have here is writing that reflects what most of us feel and communicate usually through various outlets. This commentary would fuel most of talk radio and political TV for years and is the underbelly of so many religious and political debate.Elliott's inner dialogue is so real and well performed. This is hard to do and mesh with real time. Some of the back and forth between Elliot and Angela offer great platforms for any relationship like, ""Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you!"" Who hasn't dealt with this and just let it go, but after, it lingers until you just fade away from someone. There's a lot of these little tidbits. Looking forward to where this show develops.",positive
"4 season was great. awesome cast, directors, everything is fantastic",positive
"I have only seen seasons 1 and 2, I don't believe I will manage to see more.The acting is mostly good.The camera work is great.The hacking vocabulary is great. I don't believe any show comes even close from this one when it comes to hacking. Some show do okay by avoiding giving too technical explanations but Mr. Robot does very well by actually getting technical.The writing is awful. There are so many side stories which serve no purpose whatsoever. This has to be at least 75% of the show.The dialogs are terrible, people interactions seem surrealist and I am not talking about Eliot who's supposed to be awkward and weird but any other character labeled as normal.The character development is absurd. The characters are divided in two categories, they either do not progress at all or switch their personality completely with no transition whatsoever.Finally the show is extremely pretentious.",negative
"The story line is compelling and (as an engineer) it is refreshing to finally see hacking and cyber security being portrait so faithfully, and without the typical crap, over-the-top hacking fantasies Hollywood has typically in store. The film making is a superb piece of art, the camera work just divine with amazing cuts that play just wonderfully with the music score they selected. The music is so well placed with different styles depending on the situation that make it so well done. I'm pretty much speechless in just about every episode. Bravo to the team. About the story itself, it is nothing short but brilliant. Well designed and after a successful first season, the adaptation to the second and third went very well. Most series lose it in between seasons, Mr. Robot did not. I hope they don't overstretch the story line, and start loosing quality in terms of suspense, engagement and plausibility. For now I can only keep my vote of 10 for the whole series, as it is well deserved.",positive
"This show screws you over on a regular basis. And not in an emotional way (like when Game of Thrones kills your favourite character off screen/as a minor subplot) but just that it is a wild ride. Do not binge watch a whole season in less than a week like I did because it will frazzle your brain to the extent that it took me a few weeks off cheesy chick flicks to recover. The acting in this show is fantastic, Rami Malek is perfect and I hope this doesn't make him typecast from now on. Christian Slater was a really pleasant surprise, he is so good in this, really deserved that Golden Globe. But the real star of the show is Sam Esmail. He has basically dedicated his life to this show and it was worth it. He is the writer, the director and he produces it. He is the mastermind behind all of it and he may well be a genius. He seems to take great pleasure into lulling you into a false sense of security just long enough for you to get comfortable, and then punches you in the face with a twist which makes you mad and impressed at the same time. Obviously, as it is a show based around hacking you would expect some lovely ""hacker voice: I'm in"" and fun animations of a loading bar with the caption ""hacking the FBI"". Or at least a super- realistic map of all the offline, heavily encrypted, password protected computers that are somehow being hacked from some guy's laptop in a Starbucks. But this series has truly ruined any other shows/movies that contain hacking because it does such a good job. In fact, the only problem I have with this show is that it contains so much technical hacker talk sometimes that it can be difficult to follow some scenes. However, I just watch it with subtitles if I'm not in the mood to concentrate fully. However, if I am concentrating properly, the hacker dialogue is very easy to follow and somewhat educational. It's almost as if they are giving me a lesson on how to hack. Obviously, if you understand computers a little better than me, it shouldn't be a problem. And given that I'm not an actual hacker, I cannot know whether the hacking is entirely accurate, but the way it is presented seems to be very realistic indeed. If, however, you know nothing about computers and are not interested at all, this my not be the show for you. And the hacking isn't the only thing which is realistic. This show manages to combine crazy surrealism with super realism at the same time. Everything is presented to you in a way that is totally believable, with a few minor exceptions which usually get explained later on. The characters are all believable and their development is not only well presented, it is logical and compelling. The only thing about the actual presentation of the show which narks me a little (and I'm being really picky here) is the use of long lingering wide shots. I personally love this most of the time (game of thrones had a particularly great one in S06E10, no spoilers) but I feel it is slightly overused here. The whole point of these shots is to cause the audience to stop just idly taking in information and switch to searching mode, because they are looking for the important thing which has halted their experience. This means they pay more attention and blah, blah, blah, the next thing to happen seems to be even more shocking and yet completely expected. However, if used too much it tires out the audience and they lose their effect, which I feel happens occasionally in this show. On the other hand, one thing which the show does masterfully is manage to include a voice-over in a non-comedy without it being annoying. I usually find voice overs to be distracting and lazy but the way it is used here, although it took a second to adjust, is actually very convincing and not lazy at all. It adds, and it doesn't take away. Anyway, to summarise, this show throws you curve balls when you didn't even realise anyone was even doing baseball based idioms and will make you question everything, both in the show and in real life. Watch like it's fine chocolate or very strong drugs, a little bit on a regular basis.",negative
Spoiler alert this show is Fight Club. What a strong start and cast to turn to an almost exact copy of a another film. If you would of told me it was a fight club based show and did things a little more different than the original I could have probably enjoyed it more. It could have been so much more. What a let down.,negative
"I have never had the experience of sitting back after the end of a show, fulfilled - until today. The compassionate feelings, the ingenious direction/directing and the involvement in character development had me hooked right up till the end.
The display of the main theme in Mr. Robot is so on point that you might think it's the truth.. Until it is not. Both by the actors and the script.It ended how it was supposed to, glad to not see another 5 seasons coming with thinned out plots. Had me dropping tears while my head's spinning around the thought: ""Wait, is this real then?""",positive
"Alright, first time i've written a review on the internet about a movie. I've never really felt the urge until now. Why? Because, in my opinion, the reviews and grades that this movie has received are wrong. Really, really wrong. I was expecting something along the lines of Breaking Bad, House of Cards or maybe, maybe even the Wire. A deep, well-written, well acted, plot-driven masterpiece. I may seem superficial, but hey, it had a 9 on IMDb. It has gotta be good. And it really wasn't. The first episode had some promise. As some people have said before me, it had a Dexterish feel to it. The vigilante psychopath masquerading as a socially awkward guy.The drugs, the crying. The uniqueness of the protagonists face, his bulbous eyes. Very interesting. But my oh my, did it go downhill fast. The writing is very awkward, stilted and fragmented. Dialogue is an incredible cliché. The technical aspect of the show is badly researched. But much much worse, is the sort of angst pseudo-anarchism the main character follows. I should know, I have flirted with anarchism as a student. Bt what he says and does, is just this clichéd, depressed crap you can find on any Elmo forum. It has no depth or nuance. Rich people are bad, poor people are victims. When rich people are frustrated they beat up homeless people, accompanied by such a horrible cliché, when the homeless person asks for more money: ""more money? spoken like a true capitalist!"" PLease. Don't do that. Again, as other people have said: it's Fight Club. A bad Fight Club. Let's change the world by removing all debt. Yeah, that worked for Fight Club because it was a slightly cartoonish movie, which set rebellion as the means and goal. it wasn't meant to be taken seriously (and at the same time, it was). But this movie is meant to be taken seriously, and if you present something so utterly infantile as taking on debt databases of one single corporation as a solution for economic inequality, you are not being serious. At all. E Corp, or Evil Corp. What is this, a 30's comic? Main character changed in a few days from a semi psychopath to a angst junk. Not interesting as a character. The fsociety is meant to be some sort of representation of society, or something. Watching them interact hurts my teeth. You have the crazy tomboy with weird behavior (again, Fight Club), the Muslim girl (only one line in the series which had my attention, i really had to laugh: ""She may look innocent, but she gotta lot of Allah Akbar in her"") who is just there because she wears a headscarf, her character is as bland as cardboard. You have the streetwise black guy. You have the fat nerd. They are NOT interesting. They barely say anything at all. Group chemistry, nope. And their leader. A sort of anarchistic, freewheeling tramp who is meant to be actually superwise and stuff. He's not. He pushes someone off a bridge and give nothing of an explanation, accept that he sometimes gets mad or something. Now for the love interest, who I have named Miss Makeup. Because she wears too much makeup. She reminds me of a ex of one of my friends. Anyway, I don't find her interesting at all. She just walks behind E-li-ooot the whole dang time.I really have nothing else to say about her. Well, accept that, like any other character in the series, she does weird crap sometimes. Like being mad a E-li-oot for standing up for her. I forgot the bad guy. He is so, so, so bad. As in crap. He keeps saying stuff in french (because thats so evil) but he speaks a Scandinavian language. He ties up his wife and gags her, but does nothing with her, all the while being worried that tying someone up who is pregnant will hurt the baby. What was that all bout. Seriously.He is such a evil rich boy cliché. Yeah, slap yourself in the face, yeah you are worthless, yeah you've said your line wrong, slap yourself again. If you don't know to what I'm referring, he was practicing a promotion pitch in front of the mirror. He would slap himself every time he didn't like it. I liked it, because he was slapping himself. Only time I liked his screen presence. I hope he falls in a meat-grinder next time. Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Don't watch this, please. And if u do, write a review, tell your friends. If this is quality, if this is the future of quality TV, I'm never watching new productions again. Ill stick to effin books.",negative
"I didn't have any expectations for this show when it came out, as I had heard nothing about it; all I knew is that it was about a hacker. I watched the pilot when it came out, it was good. I've watched all the episodes and there's one thing that bothers me so much: THE MAIN CHARACTER. I cannot get into this show with how dull the main character is. I don't know if it's the writing or the actor, but something needs to change. I'm very much into weird, psychopathic characters (like Dexter), and the main character of Mr. Robot is weird...and also very boring. He's a crazy good hacker that we find out is insane, that sound SO interesting - why is he still so dull? I don't know, if you like him, good for you. That's my one grievance against the show. Overall, it's pretty educational if you'd like to know 'hacking 101'. I do recommend, as it's still sort of enjoyable",positive
"Season 1: 8/10
Fast paced but bad twist is badSeason 2: 10/10
Slow pace and depressing Season 3: 10/10
Perfect mix",positive
"Super-compelling, with a clear intent that carries through the whole series & delivers a mind-boggling but beautiful finish. Some characters & storylines felt quite superfluous, and there were dips into tediousness, but the overall arc was exquisite with acting, direction, artistry just beautiful to watch.",positive
"This show is probably one of the most interesting things I've seen on TV in quite some time. I'm actually a big fan of just about everyone in it. Rami has been in a few previous productions that I've seen like Need for Speed, Short Term 12, Ain't Them Bodies Saints (pretty sure he was even in an episode of Gilmore Girls once?), etc.. Christian Slater obviously has deep roots all the way back to Heathers and beyond. Carly Chaikin has evolved so much from her part on Suburgatory. Portia Doubleday is the exact opposite as her character from the Carrie reboot. Not to mention the man who plays Giddeon was a cast member from House of Cards. But on top of that, the opening episode really is as intriguing as they say. And in it, they even address some issues during Elliots inner monologue at the therapist's office that, until recently weren't exactly publicly discussed except on late night liberal talk shows (not that we don't all enjoy those, but it's nice to see these recent events really get some exposure). Also, just the entire plot (and I'm speaking up unto the most recent episode, but I won't give anything away because I refuse to include spoilers in this review) is intriguing. It's just...one of those shows that doesn't necessarily need audience manipulation. It doesn't talk down to the audience. It doesn't make the audience choose right from wrong. It leaves everything open for speculation, even the things that seem to sit on the far ends of the moral spectrum. I love this show. I hope this show continues for a long time. I can honestly say that based on this season alone, I would want to see this story develop into as big of a full circle as it possibly can.",positive
"This show was really good, but the constant Fight Club rip offs left me feeling uneasy. If the creator could have just layed off the blatant copying of fight club this would have been a 10 rating for me. When the last episode copied an iconic shot from the movie.. It lost all momentum for me.Great show, it just needed to learn how to reference a movie rather than flat out replicate something that worked in another piece of film. It didnt need that and was great in its own right. 8.4 is about right.",positive
"A) RealisticNone of the fake hacking stuff, all technology is real, makes references to real companies, people, and events. Although there is some made up companies (Probably to avoid lawsuits, since these are a part of the plot). Many of personalities and people are interesting, but would be hard to find in real life. Also some things would not work in real life, like language in a business environment. There is also a aspect of the show (Can't explain/name it without giving spoilers) that may be controversial, but that depends on the viewer.B) Good plot twists The plot twists are pretty creative, and it's hard to tell what they will be, although if you pay close attention you can figure them out through the hints dropped. (I didn't, but found articles with them figured out ahead of time). Also the plot twists aren't an event, like someone jumping out of a plane without a parachute, but then landing in water. The plot twists in this show are much more elaborate, and are things that were going on the whole time, but covered up.C) ""Compressed"" EpisodesThis show could've easily been stretched out a lot longer. I Appreciate that the creator didn't do that. The episodes were really stuffed, it didn't spend extra time on unnecessary parts. After the first episode I thought I spent a lot longer than I actually did.D) Wakes you up The show also ""Wakes you up"". It shows you many realities you may not have noticed, and it also shows how much stuff goes on that you are unaware of.",positive
"It tackles both our global economic system as well as internal conflicts - such as childhood traumas being an intricate part of one's being - and the struggle of either accepting or fighting both and everything in between.It isn't like with soap operas or series alike where there's so much random plot twists and turns happening, that somehow magically comes together to fit a narrative. Here everything that happens makes sense. Yet very often not at the moment you are watching it unfold, whilst maintaining a completely believable narrative.Despite it being so extremely controversial, brutal and beyond our daily realities, it's completely possible this would or could actually happen. It's like a good sci-fi making many critiques about society and the self, where the analogies to daily life are actually not even truly sci-fi, if that makes scene?Every plot twist and every move I didn't understand or even felt was unnecessary or annoying ended up making sense in retrospect. It's the only narrative - thus far - I truly cannot predict and that's one of the major reasons I love it, yet not the most brilliant of it even.The most brilliant part remains its message. Which is similar to any good sci-fi, making you look critical about the world we live in as well as our part in it.",positive
"It had started slowly, but then it became quite exciting, especially in the 3rd and the beginning of 4th season.But the end...please. Cant you come up with something which could be more believable? It makes it a fairy tail.",positive
"I must admit I'm into these cyber shows. I'm always trying to understand what makes a hacker. This show allows me to confirm a hacker isn't made, is born.I still don't get how can you show as much of reality on a show that is purely fictional. Or is it not? The actors are well chosen for their parts and, although I'm not in so dark TV shows, I think that if we try to understand the world we are living in, we have to see gut-punching shows like this one, maybe just once. Our reality can be a little bit better than the one shown here, but it doesn't mean this ""reality"" does not exist. We can't be that naive.",positive
"Underrated piece of cinema, probably the greatest fiction in all of history.",positive
"This is an exciting movie. It is not boring. It is kind of frightening to think how things could go down. It does take a negative approach to all people being thieves. It's just the reason you do things that justifies things. Hmm. The end justifies the means. It's very left. I get the feeling that once someone becomes a leader in the corporate world or even the owner of small business that that person is considered evil. I don't think it is that simple. It is a pessimistic view of the world. It does point out some things that need to be pointed out in the world, increasing student loan debts, etc. Getting an education is getting out of hand in some places with such debt being left to the individual student to pay. As I said earlier, the movie is exciting even if at points it seems a little slow. It captures your attention. Where will it go? Any other comments?",positive
"In episode 1 I thought ""wow, 10/10"" in episode 2 fell to 6/10, Episode 3 was worse and was getting worse every episode. The horrible part is his drug addiction, who wants to see a smart guy high and delusional? That doesn't make sense.",negative
"I'm reviewing the pilot, and although I found it excellent, this is almost the Matrix verbatim without all the martial arts and science fiction setting. Main guy is the equivalent of Neo and Christian Slater is Morpheus. Both want to free mankind from an oppressing conglomerate (Evil Corp), the one that controls all the money and student loans :). The guys in the black suit are also there, and there's also a nemesis. Where this excels over the matrix, is the purpose and dialog. This time around both sides have purposes that make sense, not a forced mambo jumbo about machines using humans as biological batteries.. Main character (Neo) has a hero complex but in a very twisted and creepy kinda of way, he's also very anti-social and a very good hacker.Being a coder and a Linux user myself, technically the show is doing the right thing and talking about the right stuff. This is no CSI Cyber :) Let's see how this goes from here, I was really really pleasantly surprised by this! 10 minutes into the show I was immediately hooked, let's see if they keep up in the next episodes!",positive
"I love conspiracy, high intrigue stories. I'm very conflicted. It seems the writing and producing is as bi-polar as the characters themselves. They are complex and well thought out in some episodes, and then it seems like another writer takes over and destroys their essence in the next few, making them one dimensional. In season 2 a character suddenly goes from drawing your empathy to dark and evil. Okay...fine...but you can't do it so fast! Then he sabotages himself, and the writers never explain why. It's driving me crazy! Why? Why? This series is very good. It is. There is some very good writing. But, there is some bad writing also. If you're willing to sort through the mess, you'll walk away with a mostly enjoyable experience.",positive
"I don't typically write reviews but on this show I don't feel the star rating justifies what I actually feel about this show. In the first season I absolutely loved it, I was watching episode to episode thinking how can they top last episode and EVERY single time they managed to defy my expectations, it was amazing. But then I moved onto Season 2, waiting for them to defy expectations or at least provide some more of what I already loved. The shows story hit its climax, the characters arc finished and there was nothing more to show. It seemed as if they were scrambling for anything to write about. Angela turned into this robot-like emotionless character I don't know if it was terrible writing or the actor didn't know how to act, I just wanted to shoot myself when her scene came on. We get it, you're f*cked up. The star of the show Elliot, he's now just going crazy and crazier? Is there nothing else to talk about this character but his insanity? I skipped his scenes because they were literally pointless, someone could have just put on the screen in big bold letters 'ELLIOT IS INSANE' and I could have got the point. You don't have to put me through the terrible... Dream sequence? Crazy dream sequence?I loved the first season, I wanted more and then the show couldn't do it. If they left the show as a mini-series it would have been perfect. Clearly there was a money motivator here.",positive

"The first chapter is a piece of art, one of the best chapters I have ever seen! It combines mystery with action and all brilliantly mixed in an stressful storyline with a great ending! I thought this would be the start of my favorite TV series!However, the following ones go in decline and become gradually worse. Soon enough (around chapter 4) the plot is completely nonsense. I hoped for it to be the typical half season slow down for a better end but it really does not get any better.I am terribly disappointed to see how an outstanding first chapter can become such a mediocre series... Save your time and do not watch further than chapter 1.",negative

I really struggled to stay awake during the first couple of episodes..I'll watch a third and if it's no better then I'll go and do something less boring.",negative
"No doubt this show is the best ive ever seen.
After so many great shows like GOT, Beaking bad , the sooranos ,fargo , the wire , black mirror , prison break n many nany more i didnt expect that a mind -blowing show will emerge n sweep up all of my previous thoughts bout what a good show look like.
MR robot is beyobd that all starting with the acting of elliot who the whole show revolves around him n darline who was a great support n a true trust worthy sister n the conflict that both of him had with the e corps n white rose n this great battle that happened passing by all of the events that formed the finale which was undoubtedly epic.
I dun know how to describe the intelligence of sam esmail who wrote this show and directed it and this was the most crucial element of the success of this great show; to direct the actors to act the way you just described in your book with such awoesomeness is unquestionably remarkable. Guyz juat watch it.",positive
Made an account just to rate it a 10. season 4 alone makes this show incredible and worth the watch !!,positive
"The pilot episode of this series shows great promise. At the risk of failing to appeal to the modern television viewer who has become accustomed to shows lacking true substance, it will most certainly captivate a core audience of viewers who feel alienated by the typical programming of the modern day. The narrative touches on topics like social and digital revolution through the thoughts of the protagonist as he narrates the episode. The status quo of modern social behavior, consumerism, and corporate greed prevailing by virtue of the complacency amongst the proletariat is a core issue that both the show and protagonist address with great disdain. It ironically begs the question that if our complacency with the quality of consumer items–– such as substandard television programming––is so entrenched in our society, when we are finally greeted with an oasis of the kind of talented artistic expression that this show offers devoid of being dumbed-down or hollowed out in effort to appeal to a wider audience, will we be able to transcend our usual tastes, or will the level of real, thought-provoking narratives lead a disinterest among the typical armchair audience and eventually the show's demise? Much like other successful programs such as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""House"", that received a large following despite some very technical aspects of the dialogue that tend go over-the-head of the majority of their viewers, Mr. Robot followed suit and still holds true to it's core audience by fact-checking its more technical content and preserving its validity. Most films or programs with a hacker or computer science theme tend to overplay the ""coolness"" of what is shown when it comes something as dry as computer code by representing the digital world as it it were a fantasy, in lieu of the more accurate yet bland, plain-text unix coding on a computer screen. I was surprised and also relieved to see the actual computer science portions of the episode be accurate representations of a real-life scenario down the very character. As with other successful programs with story lines derived from complex subject matter (like medicine or theoretical physics), the amount of technical dialogue is not so much that it will bore the majority of the audience who will not understand it, but just enough that it will captivate and perhaps even educate them slightly as they are offered a glimpse into a fascinating world whose power and influence they wouldn't otherwise comprehend. My hope is that USA––the network on which the show will air––will recognize that they have struck gold, and not run scared if viewership starts off slow. Most shows of this caliber do not take off will a large audience, but rather begin to amass a strong cult following and later become a huge hit. We saw this kind of skepticism among network executives with Breaking Bad. Much like the idea of a school teacher cooking meth to pay his medical bills, a computer nerd with a social disorder and possible schizophrenia working for a network security firm by day and playing social hacktivist by night is not something that immediately screams ""blockbuster"". It's my hope that the timing of this show will prove to be its greatest strength in light of recent events in the hacking and cybersecurity world involving Anonymous, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Ross Ulbricht, and Aaron Swartz. Viewers are educated now more than ever when it comes to hacking and the impact that individuals can make on society through their ""hacktivist"" work.The protagonist of Mr. Robot is similar in many ways to these individuals, and the plausibility of his disposition is validated by their individual plights. Where they have fallen short of their ultimate goals and failed to elude capture, the audience will root for their new favorite anti-hero since Walter White to incite a social revolution through his hacktivist work. Whether he succeeds or is met with the same demise is up to the writers who have crafted this brilliant first episode.",negative
"Wow! This show just keeps you guessing, so many great twists and the acting is really good . So many amazing scenes. Not sure if it's won a lot of awards, but it really should.",positive
"That's the kind of movie that makes you think. It's dark, smart and the dialogues are beautifully written. I can't believe that all the words written there are actually allowed by the system that controls society. Yes, it states clearly how things are, how we are controlled by the corporations and its governments. I decided to write this review to ask the directors, producers and writers why they decided to write one single scene in the whole series that's completely stupid! Burning US dollars as some sort of protest? People, don't you know that money is actually just a check? And what happens if you burn a check? You are actually giving the value of that check back to the account owner!! If you burn a 100 dollars bill, you are giving that amount back to the government! I remember a scene from Batman where the joker as a form of rebellion burns millions of dollars! Well, that's Batman and Batman is not a movie that's supposed to be smart! But Mr. Robot is very smart! How could they made the same silly mistake? You want to protest? Throw those dollars back into the market and help to create inflation! Anyway, apart from that stupid scene, the rest of the entire series is extremely elegant and smart! I hope they don't change a bit the philosophy of the show!",positive
"This show made the mistake of confusing its first level storyline for its character development narrative and thought it could force our investment from one into the other over the course of the final 3 episodes.A portion of the audience don't care what happens, they're just interested in characters. And for those people this show will be everything they ever wanted.Be warned that if you care about anything other than characters, who they are and how they change, then get out before you get hooked. There is no closure for you. There is no payoff, there is no conclusion, there is no closure. The show is effectively cancelled without further notice.If this could have been flagged from the beginning, that would have perfected the show. Break storylines throughout the show, never give closure on those elements so the rest of us can get out early.The sudden change from story to biopic makes me think that the writers never quite knew how many seasons they would get, and ran out of time in the end having to choose one of the two. I choose to believe that rather than assuming they never really had a plan for the surface level story. The show was executed too well for the latter to have been the case. Maybe someone quit from the team. Who knows.",negative
"This show has ambition like I've never seen. It's an intensely introspective character development of a highly unstable but fairly moral individual. It's on the scope of Breaking Bad, but even less afraid of not fitting a mold. It lost me an episode or two with some rather chaotic story-telling, but I've come to realize that all the threads are actually weaving together. My fear is that they won't have enough fuel to carry multiple seasons, but then that's how I felt about Breaking Bad as well.A real highlight are the short intimate scenes between even minor roles. Touching and very real. You quickly care for even the minor players. The story telling is masterful.",positive
"A beautiful, interesting and genius series to the extreme, with many surprises in plot and an incredible performance from Rami Malik, genius writing from Sam Esmail and many unforgettable episodes with a very satisfying ending in short, everything in this series was perfect",positive
"Watched up to episode 6 and loving how it is building up nicely. Pity the other reviewers who bailed after episode 3... I'm now sensing some of the earlier scenes will have pay off down the road and so I recommend sticking with it.... the pilot episode is a barometer of the series as a whole and not a one off.The different plot lines are all individually interesting and the pace of how they are concluding holds the attention by giving moments of high suspense and gripping resolution whilst still leaving the sense that more is to come.Don't know anything about hacking but am told it is technically accurate... not that this really matters. Elliot is mesmerising and Tyrell's character equally so, though now less predictable in terms of where he will end up. Visually I think it looks great and the metronomic score helps build the excitement brilliantly.I'm not an anti capitalist but everyone likes an underdog story... I now find myself desperate for each week to pass for the next episode, which is always a good sign.Go on Elliot you crazy drug addled weirdo! I'm rooting for you!",positive
"Mr. Robot is a mind-boggling thriller/drama series that will suck you in more with every episode watched. It's plot is brilliant and complex but also thrilling at the same time. I already watched it couple of years back, but didn't understand everything as I was too young to understand all the politics/economics and hacking in general. It certainly helps if you know the basics of computer programming and networking, but even if you don't, you won't be dissapointed. In my opinion this is the nest show I've ever watched and I also praise the director and storywriters for developing such a brilliant masterpiece that future generations will (hopefully) love. Recommend!",positive
"This is the type of show that makes and defines an actor, a writer, and a director. Without going total fanboy on this show, it is everything you could ask for in a show. The character of Elliot is so endearing, he appeals to every emotion of the viewer. My one and only wish about the show, is that it wasn't on basic cable. I think allowing to be free of censorship would do the show some good, and it's a little ironic that it is censored. I am a little worried that it was renewed for a second season, as every episode has felt like a season finale, I am left to wonder what kind of cliff hanger there will be on it's actual season finale. And I do hope the whole evil corp plot line doesn't get played out and drag through the entirety of the show. To everyone involved in this show, I say Hello friend, and thank you. It has been too long since a show like this has been done, and I look forward to the future.",positive
"As a computer programmer myself (one who has his fair-share of hacking knowledge), I am very impressed with just how accurate this show is. It doesn't feature the typical 'omg, we must hack into the NSA using a tron motorcycle' or big screen with a green matrix on it. In fact, the characters themselves make fun of hacker shows like that. Instead, every hack, every term coined, pretty much /everthing/, is completely realistic. The jargon is on point, and the hacking process displayed in the show is the actual process a real hacker would use. Social engineering, some doxing, some good old-fashioned brute force (which, like in the show, usually doesn't work).10/10, the acting is great, the realism is amazing. Definitely worth watching, especially for those who know about computers.",positive
It's an awesome show... Mostly because of the real codings and everything they show in here. also the way they portray the life of a troubled guy. The show is awesome. I totally recommend it,positive
"This show had potential on the first season but on season 2 it starts off with it's left foot. So this review is mainly about the first season.The story-line is pretty good, not too far fetched from reality. The characters lack depth and they don't seem to evolve much, if at all. Which leads me to one of the negative aspects of this series, the main character, Elliot. To keep it short, he is a walking cliché. The narration adds to this feeling. We've all seen this before, we all know this character. Another good guy, doing the right thing by any means he has available. When he should be a morally ambiguous character, which would make more sense when taking into account his misanthropic views.The other thing that bothers me to a point that it really distracts and annoys me is the terrible use of negative space on image composition. I get it that they want to portray Elliot as emotionless, distant, sometimes empty and it works in that case. But it doesn't work on almost every single shot where negative space is being used with no purpose at all. I think the director just wanted to be different for the sake of looking artsy and for egocentric reasons. If you can feel the director when watching a series or a movie, the director failed to do his job. The average viewer may not notice this, but as a filmmaker i can't help but be distracted by this.Having said the two main (and huge) factors that put me off this series i can say that everything else is good. The actors are good, the cinematography is standard, the soundtrack is fitting and it will keep you guessing what will happen next. I don't think that any of the ideas portrayed in this show are somewhat revealing or eye opening. To me it all seems pretty obvious and there is nothing new here. And i think that the writers expect to send a message to it's viewers with that goal in mind.",positive
"Mr. Robot is definitely worth watching. Its Fight Club (1999) meets Hackers (1995) meets Donnie Darko (2001). In fact, I would say Mr. Robot is a complete rip-off of these three films. So, if you like these three (old school) movies, definitely check out this series, and if you haven't seen Donnie Darko yet, definitely check it out. It's one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.Mr. Robot runs for 4 seasons in total. Season 1, 3 and 4 were outstanding. However, season 2 was a bit slow/boring. In fact, I initially checked out of the series halfway through season 2 back in 2016 because nothing really happens for the first two thirds of the season. However, I decided to give Mr. Robot a second try during COVID-19 and I wasn't disappointed.P.S, if you're interested in watching some really good psychological thrillers, check out Fight Club, Donnie Darko, Secret Window and Shatter Island :)***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD******DON'T READ IF YOUR PLANNING ON WATCHING THE SERIES***For those who have seen Mr. Robot, I must admit I was very disappointed with the ending. Part of me thinks it completely ruined the whole series for me. In the first season we learn that Elliot has an alternate personality (like Edward Norton from Fight Club) who is Mr. Robot. However, in the final 2 episodes we learn that Elliot (or the Elliot that we have been watching from season 1 to 4) is just another one of his alternate personalities, and his real personality appears to be a smart, well-adjusted young man, who looks as normal or as sane as you or me, which I feel is just completely out of place for the series. I feel it's the equivalent of watching Silence of the Lambs and at the end of the film learning that Hannibal Lecter is nothing more than an alternate personality, and his real personality is someone as likable and charming as Chris Hemsworth or Chris Evans. Could you imagine Fight Club finishing this way? It just throws off the whole story. We like these characters because their insane or mentally ill. How does it even make sense for Elliot's real personality to be so normal?I think a better ending would have been that; after Elliot's final showdown with Whiterose his mind fractures even further, and finishes very similar to the film Secret Window. Elliot's mind completely disappears, and creates a new personality to live his life, i.e., Elliot becomes his alter ego, rather than Elliot being the alter ego of the real Elliot and then choosing to disappear willingly. Now this ending suits the character and is much better than the fairy-tale ending that we were given. It also leaves the story open for a reboot and finishes on a great twist.",positive
"After watching the last episode for the first time 5 minutes ago I can now that the feeling I am feeling now is one of the greatest feelings I have ever felt. This was a remarkable feat for the whole cast and crew throughout the series, and of course the creator, Sam Esmail. I feel like I now can understand how art, people, society, perspectives shape us. I truly am speechless. Best show I ever will see. This has been a 6 year ride for me, and this show has had the influence on me since I was 12. The impact this show has had on my life and who I am is unbelievable. I didn't realize til now that I am here to say farewell. And I'm not ready to say goodbye, but I have too. Goodbye friend, I love you and thank you!",positive
"I've just finished it, and I don't know what to do with my life. Basically, I'm shocked, say, angry but happy at the same time and like how did these 4 years pass so quickly? My favorite actor is Rami Malek, he has a big part in my life.
Thank you Mr.Robot and
Goodbye friend.",positive
"I have some mental disorder, not as f* up as our main protagonist, but still, in 4 years this show let me realize that you don't need to live in some fantasies to be happy.
I think Mr.robot nailed exatly what it means to be alone trying to live among other people.
It's a sad but beautiful picture of our society, making you understand that we are always capable of doing the worst and the best, that nothing is heads or tails.
We are just disconected from each other, and at the end of the day, what matters the most, is the people who you call family.",positive
"I am not going to write more about it. I liked the idea of a TV show about a hacker, but this is just embarassing. Couldn't watch more than 3 episodes.",negative

"While Famous cable network like HBO, AMC, FX and show time often find themselves shows which gets all the attraction from viewers. Now Universal Cable Productions has got a show that will get attention. Now the channel get to deliver a great crime drama, Mr. Robot. Created by Sam esmail, never heard of him since before this show came to light but i can really say he has taken TV industry to completely another level. Mr Robot is the first cyberpunk thriller series in the television history.Starring Rami Malek, the series follows the journey of Elliot, a computer programmer working at a cyber security firm and playing the role of vigilante hacker. His life isn't normal when he interacts with living world around him due to anti social disorder.Elliott has symptoms of autism. He's brilliant, obsessive with computers and has no social skills But things start to change when he meets Mr. robot and joins his group (Fsociety).*My Opinion*After a disappointing year of 2015 for TV series. Sam brought this masterpiece show. When i watched it's pilot i hooked up with the show in no time. it was truly a jaw dropping episode for me. And you just can't blink yours eyes while this show is on. this show is taking social-media paranoia to the mainstream. After this series has shown the viewers hacking a social-media account isn't much hard for a guy like Elliot (Rami Malek). it might be offensive for few but this show is serving nothing but truth.A show of it's time, Mandatory viewing for hackers or programmers or coders or developers or whatever. Don't just sit there go watch this show you dummy :D -peace-",positive
"Mental health, capitalism corrupts society, f##k the rich, etc. No way this series could be bad!Well... but its lost 2 stars because of this US hegemonic rhetoric: LETS BLAME ALL TO CHINA!!!1!",positive
"What is all this fuss about anti-capitalism shows these days. The pilot and the environment could have led to a great show but the more we advance into the story the worst it gets. The side story with Angela Moss is just dull and full of clichés. The only good side story is the one with Tyrell Wellick. Sure he's evil and there are lots of reasons to hate him but he's the only interesting character that I actually like. In brief this show is tremendously overrated on IMDb. I started watching it because of its ratings, but regretted it after the first episode. And it kept getting worst",negative
"The series begins with an interesting premise (words about the control of the world), but quickly tries to show a ""strong and bizarre"" character as Dr House, Lie To Me, etc. But what it is really striking is that the images, procedures and words are overly ridiculous, and there are far from what a true hacker is. ¿IPs that begins with 400? Nobody knows about the existence of root-kits in a security company? You are a hacker because you uses KDE? Come on, it's absolutely ridiculous. I'll give him one more chapter of opportunity. PD: one more thing: if you knows something about internet and security and believes you are a hacker, don't put proofs about your crimes in dvds. Think about it.",positive
"I am a VERY forgiving consumer. I enjoy everything I watch. I can count on one hand movies or TV shows that I thought were awful and couldn't finish...This is one of them. It's ""edgy"" and ""brilliant"" for sure. The acting was A+. Confusing and boring? That too.... If I had to describe it in one word: frustrating. Frustrating because after something happened, I would have to sigh and wait to see if it was imaginary or real.At times, when the main character is high or crazy, I honestly felt like fast forwarding to get back to the ""story"" (what there was of it). I stuck with it because the show had such a high rating, but it was not entertaining. There were some entertaining twists, but the pilot was honestly the best episode of the entire first season. I quit watching after absolutely nothing worthwhile happened during the first three episodes of season 2 and I asked myself why I was wasting my time watching something I did not enjoy in the slightest.If you absolutely hate predictable ""popcorn"" shows where you know exactly what's going to happen, you might enjoy this. I'd rather watch literally anything else.",negative
"Absolutely riveting! I stumbled upon this show by chance from the title since I program robots. Although having nothing to do with robots it's still relevant to my interests! The show had me hooked within the first 5 minutes. I'm a huge fan of narration and believe when done correctly is gold! It just creates a deeper connection with the character. A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, American Beauty to name a few.Rami Malek playing the socially awkward Elliot Alderson is perfection. They couldn't have picked a better actor and it's nice to see Christian Slater on screen. I'm just finishing up season 1 and the twists, THE TWISTS!!!! I'm not a great reviewer... It's amazing and creative. The writing is phenomenal, just watch it so it stays on the air haha!Oh, the filming is quite peculiar! Their faces are nearly always on the edge of the frame with strange angles. I've never seen anything like it and noticed it immediately. There's almost an emptiness being cultivated that intensifies Elliot's screwed up world. It's like everyone he interacts with is not there. An extreme sense of loneliness, which I happen to be all too familiar with. Great writing, directing and acting. I hope the seasons are plentiful!",positive
"Great series ruined by the last 3 episodes. The plot took a bizarre turn for the worse, expanding the idea of multiple personalities that had already been overdone",negative
"Mr. Robot uses building blocks from everything from Fight Club to Twin Peaks. As you watch you can see every influence. The title card feels like Kubrick designed it and you feel hints of his style in a lot of shots. The one thing that is new and different is how the show portrays technology. TV and film fail every time to show a realistic portrait of computers and hacking. Mr. Robot has no flashy fake graphics and a ton of jargon that sounds good but means nothing. From the first scene we are fully locked into reality as Elliot casually explains to a coffee shop owner that his .onion TOR pedophilia site has been found and the police are on their way. The familiar bits and the new realistic representation of technology blend to form a show that isn't like anything you've seen. Mr. Robot never holds your hand and it keeps you on your feet. Each new turn feels calculated, a place for everything. Sam Esmail, show creator, says that the show is already built and that it is headed somewhere, and you can feel it as you watch each episode. The mysteries are slow to unravel, but this hopefully isn't another Lost, which felt like a cobbled together make it as you go monster. Hopefully Mr. Robot proves itself to be a precise, well-made watch such as shows like The Wire and Breaking Bad.",positive
"This is my first review. I have to review this show it's that good. A cross between Inside job, fight club and requiem for a dream. I love this show so much I've started watching it through for a second screening after only a weeks break. I work in IT, I'm not a coder, but it's realistic enough to hook me in to its storyline. Very Addictive and with a touch of occupy Wall Street too thrown in.I love this show. I give it 10/10 on my second viewing. It's not absolutely perfect but it's so close that I have to give it a 10. I can't wait for more of Mr Robot. The only problem is waiting for more. Hurry up please.",positive
"Thank you Sam Esmail!
I saw the whole final season this month and the last 5 episodes after the golden globes and I'm wondering why Rami doesn't won it. Especially in episode 11 (at his meeting with whiterose) he was exceptional.",negative
"Okay, so I will not try to drag this review and make it extremely long so you can't read but, this is definitely one of those shows which will reward you for noticing every single detail, for staying there, and elliot himself at the end of the series appreciates you.After completing each show I had this feeling of emptiness, and void in side me that a show could be never be as great as this (for Example, I completed Breaking Bad, Dark & Sacred Games and had this feeling of void inside of me) But this, this made me question what I was doing with my life, and I should make it better, I was rather motivated.I never felt so good being a viewer. Although one thing to keep in mind, Sam Esmail is big movie nerd/buff, so he takes hard inspirations from movies Like Fight Club, The Shining, and other cult classic movies.Just Give it a try, Try to complete 1st season and then show just keeps on rewarding you., and this has the best ending to any show I've ever seen, or best show I've ever seen at all.",positive
"Mr Robot grabs you with its story and can sometimes be so complex, but after watching the whole series there is no UN answered questions and I so brilliantly written and the acting is above perfect!! I could not stop watching this series, usally I would jump between shows because they can get a little bit much to keep watching continuously but I never had that problem here. 11 out of 10 🙌🏼",positive

Season 2: 1/10
Season 3: 6/10

I'm going to make this short and sweet. This is one of the best series ever. You will be sucked into the protagonist's mind-bending world and you will thoroughly enjoy it. There are very many plot twists along the way which will blow your mind. The soundtrack is expertly crafted and you're going to thoroughly enjoy this extremely thought-provoking work of art. Please watch it; you will thank me.,positive
"One of the series i have ever seen. What a storyline, hacking sequence, conflict of life. New era of seeing the world.",positive
"I just so happened to stumble upon the show and decided to give it a try because I am a programmer as well. And I am glad I decided to watch it that day. These guys have taken up a great theme and Rami Malek has done great justice to the lead character as well. We have seen movies on this genre but it is good to see an excellent series picking it up as well. The prospect of the world being run by faceless people is already quite popular in this skeptical modern world. The producers decided to have a go at it and executed it perfectly. I can sense that they are trying to build the thrill starting at the pilot episode itself. What can be hoped is that by the time the season gets over we shall be pretty satisfied (and more skeptical) about what just went down. Hopefully, this shall continue into the future episodes and, possibly, seasons as well.",positive
"I've tried to watch this TV Show. I watched the first 3 episodes, but it wasn't interesting to me. Donno ... it lacks something to be entertaining",negative
"Recomended to everybody who like satisfying,
psychological drama...",positive
"I have seen Rami Malek grow as an actor but he really found his place with this role. Very good acting, awesome production and the music editing is what really puts the cherry on top of the Sunday. This show has an aura of dark thriller and unintended vigilance that makes everything intriguing. Kind of a 'Dexter' mixed with 'the social network'. I really like Christian slater here as well. He plays a mysterious and somewhat care free guy. I was surprised by how well Malek acted too it's if he was born to play this role. If you want a show with mystery, excitement and a kind of sociopath vigilante you should really check this out. The hacking also seems realistic compared to many other shows.Pilot was great i think this might be my new favorite show.",positive
"Mr Robot is one of the better written and directed shows to emerge in recent years. It shows the world (real or fantasy, one is never sure) of Elliot, our main character as he battles with the demons in his mind. There are also a string of other characters which, frankly, I am not sure why they are there and what the add, apart from complexity to the script.The thing that most annoys me, and it is not just confined to this show, is how the dialogue is recorded and mixed that sometimes it is near impossible to understand. For example, you can hear the sound of every car in the background street with exceptional clarity, yet cannot hear properly what the actors are saying. This is very common in lots of shows and is very annoying, often you need subtitles. Really, what are the Audio engineers thinking?",negative
"I get it. Fancy, somewhat accurate hacking shown on TV. This accounts for most of the big ratings. Also IMDB should be separating ratings by season. Season 1 was okay. Season 2 is a pile of irrelevant scenes that make no sense whatsoever, designed to FOOL the viewer.This is like blindfolding you during college basketball and all you can hear are the squeaks of runners and the athletes grunting.May as well be some kind of weird porno.Stories are like jokes...they're narrated.Not only is the narration performed by an insane character, but by an omniscient narrator that is purposely confounding everything else.BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is ""Art"" without story. If you went to a restaurant and got food like this, you would spit it up due to its nasty taste or you would throw up.WHO signs off on this garbage in hollywood? I want my TIME back, and so do countless viewers who have wasted their lives WAITING for something to HAPPEN that is actually relevant.Yes, the actors can act. This isn't about acting but some kind of story.Season 2 is the worst pile of crap I have ever seen. Not to mention, the story world's economics is impossible. America has been funding wars to greater than 20 trillion dollars...but we're supposed to believe there is a shortage of money to run things? the USA has been bankrupt on paper for decades--clearly this has nothing to do with power plants and economics.We're supposed to suffer through episode after episode of mindless crap. My gawd, this got an Emmy? Pathetic.",negative
"I have watched Mr Robot for the past four years and can sincerely say that it has left me completely emotionally satisfied. The entire cast does an incredible job and the cinematography makes have frame museum worthy.
Thanks for the good times.",positive
"Mr. Robot is a bit tough to rate due to the drastic difference between its first half and second half. After the first two seasons, it would've been a firm 6 - there's enough great production value and acting to have it be watchable, but the plot was more random convoluted character actions than anything to really attach to. Seasons 3 and 4 are great television, with ample tension and psychological complexity that was lacking previously. All of the characters I love in Mr Robot shine in seasons 3 and 4 - White Rose is absolutely amazing, especially after understanding their devastating history; Irving is an absolute legend; Tyrell is really fun; and driving the plot forward is Elliot, who we grow to understand much better and who has much more clearly defined goals and psychology. The ending does tie everything together beautifully, as we finally understand who Elliot is and how his past affected his psychology. Throughout the show you'll get creative camerawork, great acting, and great production value across the board, but once you get into seasons 3 and 4 the show evolves into one of the best on television. Really interesting that it was originally conceived as a movie, I would've been curious to see how that looked and if it could've been fleshed out well enough to be really affecting. Mr Robot is a really smart and creative show, but its enduring messages are much more about psychological trauma than inequality and corruption like I expected.",positive
"Amazing show, a different view of the world we live in today",positive
"Watching this show is a lot like eating a beef and bean burrito from 7-Eleven at 1am. The first few bites were delicious, but before you know it you're on the toilet punching through 6 inches of porcelain.Mr robot episode one was surprisingly good and lived up to all the hype that this crappy show has somehow garnered... in a way it kind of felt like Dexter in a modern, nerdy way. Everything after that first episode could be wiped with and flushed down a toilet. The show suffers from several problems. First, the main character is incredibly annoying and makes me want to punch myself in the face. Christian Slater (though great in True Romance) has similar effects. His acting is about as good as Rob Schneider and his character's persona (and accent) becomes increasingly challenging to take seriously. Next, the plot line is completely illogical and must have been scrapped together by a bunch of unemployed, heroine-addicted writers who thought this was a good idea at the time. Nothing in this show is realistic despite the fact that this show constantly strives to be 'technically accurate'. It's not. As if the show wasn't already intolerant enough, you can't go more than ten minutes without having some anti-corporation, anti-republican party, pro- liberal horse manure rammed down your throat. Despite the high ratings this show somehow received, it is crap.",negative
"It's basic cable, so I like and expect a bit of cheese with my shows. Mr. Robot didn't give me enough cheese....and that's a good thing. I know its probably coming. They can lay it on a little from episode to episode. This show is cool. You can tell why David Fincher's name is connected to this. Rami Malek is going to be a star. Likable, but dark protagonists are where its at. I just came home from my first visit to New York city. Mr. Robot completely captures being in the city, the trains, the coffee shops, and most importantly, the people. What better city to have your character who suffers from anti-social disorder bounce around it? USA network, you have my attention",positive
"Like most people have pointed out, the series starts off strong, but then t becomes complete garbage. The plot moves extremely slowly (some scenes and even shots going on for way too long), with many of the sub-plots dragged on unnecessarily long. And these sub-plots seem to have very little impact on the main storyline.The writing seems childish. The main character's internal monologues are an attempt at sounding profound, but they end up sounding like the lyrics of a song from a teen emo band.The characters are flat and boring. Just giving a character a tragic backstory doesn't make them interesting.The acting is rigid and inauthentic (with a few exceptions). And this was a pet peeve but the protagonist, who apparently has crippling anxiety and depression and lives in a crappy apartment, looks healthier and more in shape than most of the other characters. I know the main character has to look good for TV, but I just can't buy that.",negative

"The volume guy didn't do his job right, when music comes I had to change manually my volume different times over different episodes.
Not acceptable.
Great Serie for the rest.",positive
"I looked forward to this show as I like dark, interesting stories. Dark it certainly is. Interesting, no.I like others made it through the 3rd episode but quit watching after the explicit gay sex scene. Scenes like that contribute absolutely nothing to the story line but certainly promote an agenda. Add to that the pointless meandering boring plot and there's no reason to keep this show on the watch list.The only useful thing about this show would be trying to decide which sociopathic character you hate the less. About as confusing as an episode of Lost!!! but at least Lost was captivating.",negative
"I watched the first season only.I agree with other reviews that the monologs are not leading anywhere, the story line is fairly lost after three episodes and the series becomes an uninteresting soap opera cliche.A big miss since it could have been done better.",negative
"I wish there was a way to rate this series by season. I started the series based on IMDB 8.8 rating. Here's how it should beSeason 1 : 9.5
Season 2 : 1
Season 3 : you are real brave to survive season 2. The season 1 started so great with gripping story line, strong characters and Screenplay. Season 1 left me thrilled and I wanted more so I started season 2. After s2ep3 and started to feel like elliot himself. ""Am I crazy?"",""Is it a dream?"". I swear to God, i started the series looking at the rating. So I cameback to IMDB to carefully read all the reviews. DO NOT watch season 2 and beyond. You'd be thankful that saved few valuable hours or your life. I think people prematurely rated the series without completely watching All the season. which bumped it up to 8+.",negative
"I'm seeing reviews how this ""seems so real"". Really?! Okay, so they throw out a few terms about Hacking and people get all excited. The plot line on this is so thin in places you can practically see the other side. It has a few places where you think it might get interesting and then they just blow it. What a complete waste of time.",negative
"Mr. Robot based on drama-thriller genre however the thing making it most different and unique is its story and most important Cinematography. I have studied Cinematography as a subject enough to know that what Mr. Robot does totally breaks basic rules of cinematography, yet so appealing that it works flawlessly.Mr. Robot's first episode or Pilot as it is called is the only episode or the content that i have ever watched more than 2 times. Elliot who is the protagonist of the story is cyber security engineer who has completely different view of the world that we live in and brings out the harsh reality from his perspective which usually goes unnoticed.Story follows this young programmer who views world in disgust and usually hates this society as he is tired of everyone being hypocrite and fake. He also is a vigilante hacker who exposes wrong people which is great irony. Though this is what is revealed in pilot only to realize later that there is much bigger story and which will change anyone's perspective. It turns into great psychological thriller as wrong side of Elliot is revealed only to make you question if you should root for this character who faces conflicts within himself and tries to save the world by doing unethical works. Moral ambiguity is one of the factor that is very realistic and makes us viewer only involved in the world. From Elliot's point of view, we are his imaginary friend to whom he talks to, not as in breaking the fourth wall but his thoughts and only his thoughts and we are set on a journey where Elliot has a dream of better world which he tries to accomplish when a weird man follows him and offers to join his group of hackers to change the world for better.
Let's talk about cinematography, Quadrant framing is something very unusual which results in jarring effect making it unwatchable but in this show this framing suits perfectly as a character's head is shown on right bottom or left bottom exposing rest of the screen completely empty which displays isolation the character and gives a clean look to the character which is what story is driven by.On further viewing the story unveiled is mind baffling and clearly stands out of all tv shows ever.
I highly recommend this show to anyone but in the end this is not the show for everyone.",positive
"This show is a must watch for anyone who loves a cerebral thriller with serial plot and great character development. You can tell that this is something Sam Esmail was very passionate about and it comes through in his writing, directing, and producing.",positive

"It happens that our household was late to the Mr Robot experience, and we just recently watched Season 1 in its entirety. Throughout the season, we had mixed feelings about the show - generally appreciating the plot line, intrigue, film direction, and performances, but often put off by its confusion and implausibility. We enjoy wild plots and dark themes, however with Episode 10, the Season Finale, we were done with Mr Robot. For us, every segment, every conversation, and every behavior of this episode was nonsensical. Angela's role at Evil Corp? Her strange conversations with the CEO? The shoe store scene? Elliot freaking out in the parking lot and in Tyrell's vehicle - 'where are you??? Where are you???' The incoherent encounter with Joanna? The meeting between his psychiatrist and the hacked guy? And to cap it all, the scene involving his alter ego (father / Mr Robot), mother, and younger self among thousands of celebrating FSociety fans and then with the family projected on the mega screen? Yes yes, we know Elliot is mentally ill, but it seemed the object of this show was to make us all that way. We were able to deal with sporadic confusion and absurdity throughout Episodes 1-9, but with Episode 10, there was an astounding, persistent lack of clarity that unfortunately shut down our interest.",negative
"Mr Robot has a combination of compelling characters with actual, unexpected, enriching plot twists that will keep you tuned in for the duration of the series",positive
I was recommended this in HMV - and thought the story sounded just the thing to watch with my teenager as sort of attempt at all watching something. I forget now the details as it was a few months ago but there is unnecessary rude content - not nice at all. And the story is boring too ! Sounds good but its not - I do not understand the rating !,negative
Love the mood and filming technique of the tv series. Sam Esmail is such a great actor ! Loved it so much !,positive
"A very nice and intelligent show. However, the last season lacks the detail, intimacy and passion of the first three seasons. The stakes got low, the concept got shallow and far fetched. The message and narrative based on one persons tragedy didn't work when apllied to large scaled social idiologies, fell short. The characters started to become parodies of themselves.The first three seasons are solid though, really nice. Most of the cast is delivering top performances. Writing is really good. But as I said the last season doesn't catch the standards set by the first three seasons.",positive
"My expectations were so high that I feel a bit puzzled. I... I don't get it. Like, I agree, great characters, fantastic actors, fantastic shots, fantastic writing, but as I'm almost finished with season 4, I'm still hoping that I'll fall in love with the show as everyone else seem to have.This is so darn dark, always... No little lights of hope, almost no love at all... Plus the whole show is so very anchored with conspiracy theories that at times it's almost painful to watch.I only have two episodes left. I'm secretely hoping for a tiny bit of happy ending, but I know tht's it's probably not in the cards for Elliot Alderson.",positive
"If you like hacking, drug taking, crazy (true) story lines, Christian Slater and a mental journey of a hackmeister then you will love this show. It starts off slowish but then works up into a frenzy pretty quickly and roller coasters along quite nicely. This is how shows should be made and reminds me of the show fringe a little bit but more aggressive, less science based, less sci-fi and a whole lot more grimy and i eagerly await the download when it arrives each week and by the looks of it has 2 seasons planned from the offset so its fun times ahead for this robot lover. The acting is superb and the casting is spot on so far lets just hope they don't walking dead it and turn it into a ""soap opera"" like they did with that one.",positive
"First, episode one was very entertaining. Most techies will be able to identify with the main character. We are all disappointed and angry that we live in the future and it somehow it sucks more every year. The 'E' corp suits are shaping up to be entertaining villains. Mr. Robot is mysterious and lives in a cool retro arcade which draws you in.Mr Robot claims wiping the credit cards clean will free the masses from being slaves to the banks? NOT. The banks will get bailed out or we all get to take the time machine back to the stone age. The masses will rack credit up again, WAY faster and more reckless than before. Why? Because they will simply assume that the bank fairy will come along again. Ever lend money to a relative? Ever get paid back? Ever??? Relatives expect debt forgiveness. They don't pay you back because they forget how desperate they were and their jealously blinds them into believing they deserve your money. They work harder, or are smarter, or you are mean or whatever. Sound familiar? The human race are your brothers and sisters.Got debt? Just pay your cards down. From experience, life sucks for 1 year but after that it gets way better really fast. Those who did Dave Ramsey's debt snowball know how empowering it feels. Or negotiate your debts and pay 10 or 20 cents on the dollar. Don't worry about the banks, they expect some write-downs just like you expect your relatives to shaft you lending money. Unlike you the banks factor that into their interest rates. Or declare bankruptcy. That's capitalism's debt fairy. You won't be able to finance a car for 7 years - but that's actually a good thing. So far the show paints us as trapped cattle and never considers that we have the will to avoid our own slaughter.I hope this show visits the real issues. Like the foolish class war. Or the real reasons behind our stagnant living standards. Or that for the first time the fruit of this technological revolution is yielding for our children a world worse off.",positive

"But you are missing that guy, Sam Witwicky, in this season. Would be awesomely great if you had this, Anton Yelchin, one in trio with the rest. But yeah the is out the rest is rest... Well, this season of your is resting. And as I see, it won't be late until you, guys, pull your masks on back at your face... Hmm,.. maybe think wider, but at the same period of time as your political race is on going.And don't forget. Maybe your scrip is in drama now, but what it takes to change your face-look at all of this, that's happening. Maybe think deeper than just the mask, but, maybe, THINK - MASK ?!",negative
"So, I just ended watching Mr. Robot S01 and I must say I'm far more than impressed by it. One of the best series I've seen in a long time not just for the plot, the acting, but the whole world and constant changes it shows.It started just for the hacking theme of it. First episode, I realized it was way more than that; taking the hacking/tech side, it's the most accurate depiction on TV and on film ever made. I know, it has to have some fiction but the names, software, actions used are like ""wow"" in terms of reality.There are several kinds of characters that all bond perfectly in the series. Several well-known actors along with less or unknown ones make this a perfect mix that delivers flawless acting in your screen.Ready for S02? Well, the series has been renewed already, and hope it keeps its pace because is crazy.You cannot just blink or answer your phone because you will miss a key scene that will change everything else. One of the series that I just need to rewind a couple of times to get the whole scene. That is Mr. Robot.",positive
"Enjoy! Rami Malek is amazing . Glad it's back after such a lay off ! But I understand rami Malek is really busy, just happy he came back to finish the series",positive
"Couldn't make it through the first episode. Absolutely terrible. Main character is a dead- eyed junkie-stalker persona, and comes off as a complete creep. Other characters are annoying at best. Despite its attempt at raising the volume in key scenes to promote drama, it's pretty predictable. Hard to understand what the main character is saying when he does speak, as he's either slack-jawed or mouth-breathing through every scene.",negative
"I just finished watching season 4. And wauw, I need a moment here. This review doesn't contain spoilers. Many of my friends and family didn't make it through season 2 of this amazing show. That is truly, their loss. Season 3 and 1 were already absolutely really good. The writing, the acting , the twists, the music. But season 4 takes the whole show to another evolution. I can't remember how many times I cried, because this show and season 4 is so emotionally. It's about fear, hatred, feeling like you aren't yourself. You don't belong,where you are. All heartfelt stuff easy to identify with.Rami Malek and Christian Slater actor really well. But I must also not forget to mention Darlene played by Carly Chaikin is really well. I don't know if there will be and come a season 5. If not I don't mind because season 4 was sheer perfection. I really hope more of my friends and family will continue watching this great tv show.",positive
"There is the certain things i love about mr.RobotCamera work is a piece of pure art.Cast: All family members are look alike, I've realized this only while watching S4.It's an opinion and maybe wrong one but i suppose that all main female cast is homage for Angelina Jolie in Hackers.Solid, worked out storytelling line through the all series. Every twist is mentioned since the first season.Incredible in the tech details, an extra touch to the narrativeLoved it.",positive
"Fantastic script writing, directing, cinematography, score, lighting, effects, choice of locations and of course acting!I came into this with some knowledge of the type of circles portrayed by the show and have been very pleasantly surprised by the amount research carried out and references to real life things that only those with knowledge of these would get and relate to.What may be a shock to many, is how close, although exaggerated, the psychology of the characters actually are to their pseudo real life counterparts.I love everything about this TV show, although I find the ending lacks fulfilment of the viewer.Of course the ending is subjective, and I would have written it slightly differently, but I am sure many will be very happy with it!As a note, you should be able to work out who ELIOT is by the last episode alone. It's cryptic but it is there.For anyone reading this and put off by the fact it is a ""hacker TV show"".What it actually is, is a dark, captivating show about human psyche that just so happens to be about hackers.Probably my favourite TV show of all time!9.5/10",positive
"This is my first review, so please try and be considerate. It's what any techie would want out of a tech TV show! It has everything a person could want in a show, minus the gratuitous sex which I don't mind. I can't find anything wrong with the show. If I could think of one thing that I don't like about it would be that it's on network television, so there is a limit to what they can actually say or do. I feel like I've been waiting for a show like this for years! I""m hoping that the producers can find a way to stretch the show for at least 5 seasons. I'm excited to see how deep they can go with the story line. It's on the second season so I suppose only time will tell how far the show goes.",positive
"The show is good, but they are trying too make that exciting that became too much. Let me rephrase that... There are too many things happening, threads, plots... The story is becoming no sense. Writers, focus.This started as a geek freaky hacking guy wanting to save the world, but now is a dark story with assassinations, drug dealers, and yuppie executive psicopats, that i really did not know how to fit together. Unless the writers have a happy and consistent ending for us, this show has gone to far in the seek of entertainment.The performance is very good. The main character, oh my God, he is absolutely amazing. You go from feeling sorry for him, to support him and even fear him. He is very good at this role. Casting 100% well done.",positive
"Great show with mind-blowing acting and story
Must watch",positive
Watching season 2 and I'm STILL confused. I had hoped for more thrilling advents but most of it is about the delusional and deranged wacko who is quite boring rather than impressing. I get the state of mind but not the extreme character.,negative
Best Movie ever. I give 10 stars to all episodes. If you don't watch this movie you will lose lots of think. I don't want to give spoiler but I'm saying again YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. Now this movie come to Netflix if you have Netflix probably you have but if you don't have buy it if you don't likes movies only buy for this movie this Maniac.,positive
"Do you remember that oversmart kid who asked intelligent questions in class but flunked in exams?. This series reminds me of that.Certain series make themselves so complex that the viewers feel in the end, boy I didnot understand that. But neither the director or writer can explain it themselves either.Eliot Alderson is the superman of hacking.He can hack anything. But in certain tough situations he will black out and his alter ego will take over and will get the work done.But how? Well the makers wont explain.(Taking down 5 backup locations of E corp)Eliot Alderson decides to take down E corp, then decides not to take down E-corp, then decides to take down some powerful people of the world.This is quite stupid coming from an intelligent hacker.The hacker group survives without any income. They are very passionate about their destruction.The season 3 is quite a bore.In the end it turns out to be a good concept, not previously seen before, but still keeps the audience in dark about a lot of things.",negative
"I am an adult and I like this show. I am also a parent and I would never let my young teens watch this show. The rating TV14 is so wrongly used on so many shows and movies. This show is more like a R rating. Basically all the twisted things you think may be in this show, is. Shows like this was never easily available to teens years and further years ago. I could not imagine my younger teens even watching this show and the scenes it has. I have a parental lock on our TV/cable for certain ratings shows. I know there are younger teens, or any teens, out there that probably watch this. The amount of graphic stuff in this show is not for teens. This world really is getting more graphic on TV/cable and apparently they think it is fine to show this stuff to teens or younger. People just keep getting more deranged in their decisions. Again, this show is a R rating. I am disgusted in the USA network for suckering teens and younger into watching this show with an innocent sounding title and the TV14 rating. I mean, Grimm is the same rating but it clearly not on the same level as Mr. Robot. What are some networks trying to do to youth???? This is not freedom of speech. It's a bit illegal in my opinion to say it is fine to show this to any age unless they are an adult. The actors should have some sensibility also about the rating. But they are just in it for the money and they don't care if youth watches this. TV14 rating is not for shows and movies that prefer to push the envelope on racy scenes. This is why more and more youth's minds gets more twisted as time goes by.",negative
"Im a big fan of Mr.Robot, With its great acting, directing, music and the most important thing the mindful plot. It had always made me feel the great Fightclub vibes by David Fincher. Mr Robot Season 4 was really powerful and made me understood who is behind those crazy characters. I was kinda disappointed with EP10 and 11. the music was a bit cheesy in some scenes. But then the surprise comes with the last two EPs. I only can say they were soo damn good and really satisfying to watch. Thank you Mr Robot crew and cast for this wonderful artistic and anarchist masterpiece!",positive
"This is my first review, i made account only to rate Mr. Robot
So, as someone who watched countless shows, as someone who have urge to watch binge whole show as soon as it's out; i can call this show masterpice
The story-telling, the acting, the cinematography, the music, everything is on it's place
This is perfect example how to execute idea starting from the first episode, and deliver one of best psychology dramas ever seen on TV
Maybe i am just a fanboy, but i think that the show will burst as soon as it hits mainstream streaming services, maybe it will even be at the level of Breaking bad
Thank you Sam for everything that we saw and thank you Remi for one of best performances of this dacade",positive

"As a huge Breaking Bad, The Wire, et al fan, this show surpasses them in writing, aesthetics, acting, direction, and score. It's terribly difficult to explain and that reason alone is why it may forever be a cult classic.",positive
"I started off enjoying this, many of the characters are great and Elliot is especially good. The computer stuff is fascinating and seems fairly accurate. However, the casual drug taking and obsession with drugs gets really tedious and makes the whole story-line sag far too frequently, as there is too much time wasted on it. I can't figure out the agenda, but I began to suspect there is one, unless they were just trying to seem hip and alternative. This soured the whole series for me. Some of the plot lines are very clichéd and derivative, which is disappointing. Also, I know it has mainly serious themes, but the whole thing seems to lack any humour at all, some humour surely sustains a longer running series and life in general! I thought it could have been a whole lot better.",negative
"Having loved the pilot....(I mean for me it was up there with the greats of the decade), I was all over Mr Robot like it was a gin and tonic (my favorite tipple). The character development is top notch, and I cannot fault the performance of the lead characters. Rami Malek is superbly cast to play the awkward functional junky tech head that the is Eliot Alderson, the show is well worth watching for this alone. The remainder of the cast (maybe not Slater) supports Malek with endearing and complimentary performances, which as I said puts Mr Robot in that special percentile which should secure a place in the TV hall of fame.....then came the plot development.Firstly, as pointed out by several others the show has a very 'Dexter Morgan' narrative..I mean its literally like listening to the twisted serial killer himself as Malek narrates throughout each episode very much like I've heard every word before. However this in itself is not what has changed my point of view regarding Mr Robot.Its 'SLATER'....I'm not even going to be critical of his performance, I'm sure he has his fans. The issue for me is (and i could be wrong,please correct me if I am), Mr Robot simply isn't real...is he? Malek is the only character that has interacted with him throughout the series to date, and its just Tyler Durden all over again...or is it?So for me at this point of the series all I'm watching is a rehash of Fight Club and Dexter set in the uber-cool world of computer hacking. Sorry Mr Robot, I haven't heard the rules yet.....First Rule of Mr Robot is: You do not talk about Mr Robot.",negative
"I was blown away - much more than I expected. The acting and writing is excellent all round. Not just the lead actors shine(Rami Malek is outstanding), the supporting roles are very well cast. Portia Doubleday is very good. Even Gloria Reuben, who I've never really cared for, does a believable job as the therapist. I'm assuming Christian Slater is here to stay given the show is named after a name tag on his jacket. Too bad about that name though - all I could think of was that Styx song... I agree with previous comments that from a technical standpoint the show is far more accurate than most of the hacker movies and television shows out there. How refreshing to have a tech-based thriller without all the floating transparent touch screens. All in all, the best pilot I have seen this year - and I'm including Better Call Saul in that list. I only hope it comes out in Canada on June 24 as it is in the U.S. Showcase has picked it up here but they haven't announced a date, only that it is ""coming soon"".",positive
"I love everything about this show! The hacking scenes and the portrayal of mental illnesses are realistic, the plot is absolutely mind-blowing and leaves you questioning reality, the cinematography of this show is powerful and the actors seem like they're actually going thru this stuff right now!",positive
One of the best movies I've ever watched. I will remember this title for the rest of my life. Give it a chance and watch it!,positive
"I love this show. It is clever, and somehow manages to be real enough to not make nerds like me frown while simultaneously being entertaining and suspenseful enough for a total computer illiterate. It doesn't hurt that the cast is great, and especially Christian Slater makes his character multi-faceted and charismatic. The Pilot will be your one hour gained or lost, and it is a great hour to be sure. I am sincerely hoping they do not cancel this one like another great show with Mr. Slater which was Breaking In. We are living in a new golden era of television, much thanks to intelligent creations like this.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys smart shows with lots of intrigue. Not sold yet? Their team's name is fsociety, for f's sake!Give it a shot!",positive
"Mr Robot is what Earth needs at our evolutionary stage. Only very few shows attempt to be as accurate and honest about how our world operates. We are currently enslaved by debt through multi-national financial conglomerates that push humanity to oblivion. Mr Robot clearly shows how it works and gives us hope for an extremely simple solution. Eradicate debt. All countries are in debt to these conglomerates and there is no apparent solution besides revolution. I hope this show remains to it's roots and takes the opportunity to wake up the masses. Even though the hero is a drug-addict schizophrenic geek he is exactly what 99% of Earth population needs, someone who is crazy enough to see truth as it is, going beyond human normalities to explore the untouched and not succumb and be fooled by our own expectations, fears and delusions. Mr Robot + Interstellar = Earth 2.0",positive
The question is what to watch next after this masterpiece?!!,positive
"Definitely contains spoilers: Please stop here to prevent being spoiled if you have not watch this amazing show! Only wanted to note just how much it felt like Fight Club. More noticeably, it feels as if the entire premise for the show was lifted/heavily inspired from Fight Club directly. Sadly, as soon as this realization was made in the second/third episode the plot of the first season became extremely predictable and lost its novelty. Still an amazing show, just unfortunate that they not only had the same twist, but terrorist cell plot as well with similar characters and development.",positive
"Starts off very intense and misterious. But by the 2nd season it... just drags out on and on while the lead role figures out...""his problems"".It's a good show, it's actually decent at keeping the ""hacking"" look legit. It's not sloppy hakerman garbage, and is stuff that happens. Social engineering, kali OS, the shell commands, they're legit stuff. Shallow, but legit. There's just not a lot of it going on.It could be removed completely from the show and it'd be the same anarchy/insanity/screwed up society drama show. Which is fine, if you want that.I came expecting more of the nerd stuff, I got disappointed.",negative
"Everything about Mr. Robot is fine-tuned. A well-oiled machine through all four seasons.
The story is extremely well-written, and takes the word ""extremely"" to its definition in the sense of that it never stops surprising, sometimes shocking, the viewer, with little-to-no reliance on the usual formats of plot-twists.
The stunning soundtracks are perfectly immersive, never failing to put the viewer at any given scene, translating tension to audio.
The cinematography is never just showing the viewer what's happening. Much like the audio, it really puts the viewer right where Sam Esmail (director) wants him to be, showing what Esmail wants to show, always keeping the viewer in the proper mindset.",positive
"Love Rami, the story, the setting, everything about it. Could watch it over and over.",positive
"When my friend suggested me to watch the first episode of a TV show, I asked him about its title. ""Mr Robot ?"", I decided immediately to seek for it. Each episode was a perfect movie of 45 minutes to watch. The way each scene have it's own vision angle and sound background makes you live with the story. Talking about the story, I could understand a lot of things about the hacks due to my field of studying. But I noticed that it wasn't so difficult for my friends who study economics and even literature. The cool thing about Mr. Robot it's that makes you think about it even after the end of an episode. (Spoiler alert! Stop here) In the final episode, after I watched that Chinese person joining the party. I went to my bed wondering where and when did I see him. ""Did I see him in another movie or what ?"", then I remembered that he (or maybe she) was the mysterious creature who helped Elliot with nothing and went away. That is the kind of TV shows I would recommend to anyone interested in excellent stories to watch.",negative
"I have not seen more than 2 episodes, and I doubt I will waste my time on more. The show only makes sense if what we see are the wishful daydreaming of a young Asperger suffering geek. His fantasies are that young beautiful women are chasing after him to the point where he has to fend them of. Mega corporations try to headhunt him and offer million dollar positions in management. A secret ""anonymous"" type organisation try to recruit him for his superior hacking skills. And in his spare time he is an internet vigilante. So, basically the author of the series exploits young computer nerds who lack social skills, lack girls, lack authority over others, lack self esteem, lack purpose in life etc and fulfill their dreams in a TV show. And, it works. This is rated 9.2 when I write and the show really is not very good, not clever, it has nothing special at all. Except for the fact that it addresses a neglected audience of losers who want to see their fantasies become reality. A little like porn I guess. And had the writer mixed in more naked women, nerds are addicted to porn, I am confident the ratings would be even higher and maybe some school yard bullies getting beaten up. It is not super bad, I just don't see how this can appeal to others than the narrow target audience.",negative
"The best thing about this series is that the way they've retroactively altered what we thought about previous seasons, making everything more relevant again...Hats off Sam Esmail",positive
I love all seasons thank you all for this amazing work,positive
"As the title states, I believe this is the best show on television. It;s excellent on pretty much every level. Acting, directing, writing, cinematography, the score, everything is incredible. It's clever, tense, engaging and has a unique and interesting visual style. Season 1 and 3 are masterpieces and Season 2 is great, but has some issues with plot. It's a shame that a lot of people stopped watching and that not a lot of people watch the show in general, because it's easily the best show on TV right now and one of my favorite shows of all time.",positive
I've watched first 5 episodes. Nothing happened. Live is too short for such TV shows.,negative
"I think this is my favourite TV series of all time. It's a perfect ten for me. There were only a few moments throughout the whole lot that I got bored, mainly early in season two. But the rest of the episodes were gripping and mind blowing.I stopped watching in season 2 in fact, but then I decided to keep going a year or two later. I'm so glad I did.I cried my eyes out several times while watching this show and that doesn't happen much for me with TV shows. I love Elliot. His strengths, his vulnerabilities. His failings. Despite being a character with an unrealistic and almost 'super' power, he still seems somehow unbelievably real.Sam Esmail is a genius.",positive
"I haven't left many reviews here, but after finishing the final series of Mr. Robot last night, I can't not leave some token of my appreciation. This has been one of those series that kept surprising me. At times tense, thrilling, confusing... At other times slow moving but incredibly gripping nonetheless. The characters develop in a complex and satisfying way. After a few less than great episodes in the final series I was worried the ending would be a disappointment, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The last three episodes were absolutely gripping and completely pulled the rug out from under my feet. I can't remember the last time I was so moved and near tears (happy tears!) at the end of a series. Rami Malek was amazing, as were so many of the actors. Thank you, Sam Esmail. This truly is a masterpiece.",positive
"Good stuff and some of the technical detail around computing and IT are actually accurate.But it does drive me nuts, the victim complex that the main character has. Americans are still free to go off the grid, be self sufficient, and to govern the relationship between themselves and the federal government and corporations. Emancipate your mind, I want to say to Elliott. :) I do like the acting, and the moral gray occupied by most of the characters seems realistic enough. Christian Slater is good. I always think of The Name of the Rose when I see him though. :)I have a feeling we'll be watching Rami in many roles for some time to come.",positive
I absolutely loved this tv show. I loved it so much that I am now a software developer and will hopefully one day become a games developer! I know it's not hacking but it sparked my interest in coding and I love it! 10/10 a must watch.,positive
"This is absolutely fantastic. I simply love it. All of it! I just watched the first episode and i am thrilled about it. The amount of details they give about everything is perfect, the authenticity is also ridiculously good. I love it's unpredictability although it gives enough signs but they're perfectly blended so you got to be very attentive to get them, it's like Game of Thrones but this masterpiece(i can't call it a simple show) has a way better subject than GoT. It is looking our world's problems in the eyes and exposes them without any curtain or filter (those shots with real life celebrities were spot on). I can't stop eulogizing this masterpiece, it is absolutely fabulous. I love the schizo-problems genius theme and the monologues are great. I also love the mysterious guide who guides the main character into becoming the hero he's meant to be theme. The picture is also great, i love the close shots, the blurs, the cold set of colors. The sound doesn't shine out of the regular so here there is no plus. I didn't got a good look at the acting as i was thrilled about the subject and everything mentioned above, but i can say that Rami Malek was an excellent choice, his eyes and look are meant for this role. For the things i've said above i give this show 10/10 and declare myself as one of the greatest fans of it. I am waiting for episode 2 with my breath held.",positive
"Absolutely Amazing, specially for people who like science, computer/hacking stuff and psychological TV shows/movies. I have no complaints for this show. the People out there giving bad reviews are people who are too sensitive about morality or sensitive about accuracy in terms of the plot of the story or technical terminologies about hacking or network engineering. To those people I say it's TV! it's for entertainment nothing else,stop taking things so seriously, you have youtube full of educational videos and documentaries for that. This show is like a weird combination of ""The matrix"" and ""Dexter"" but without so much science fiction and instead of killing people you got hacking.",positive
"First of all there were so many small details hitting my nerve. First I did not care for much about Elliot's character and everything wrapping around him storywise and others seemed irrelevent compared to him. Elliot was annoying being naive, smart,loud mouth who was whining constantly about everything. The storyline was exiting at times but then again confusing the rest of the time. For example season 2 was my least favorite season of them all and had in my opinion the least importance to the shows storyline. And last but not least leave the fillment with bs gay stuff next time, I did not mind that stuff but please.
I actually enjoyed characters like Joanna, Tyrell, Dominique and Darlene more than Elliot. Why did they have to write Wellicks family storyline so short filled with so much sadness and darkness combined together? I wish both Tyrell and Joanna would have survived and had their family reunion instead of first Joanna getting killed to her car because of lovers quirrel and then next Tyrell's fate to end up being shot at and him winding up to die in a ditch. I was expecting more to that storyline.
The ending of a Darlene's and Dominique's lovers storyline was really disappointing when it was rushed, and brought hardly any closure to that storyline. I wished more to that storyline too, but everything was eyeing out Elliot's last moments being the only important thing to look out for that point.",positive
"Time for Elliot n the gang to start winning !!!
TV shows are escape for many mortal of the 99% who slog and where 1% are powerful ...
It's a known fact, just like the show depicts, they will continue winning no matter what..., but we turn to fiction for.some relief....So retribution it is..
White rose, price and the small shrimpy minions of the powerful to start paying for their sins.....ELLIÒT NEEDS THIS
I NEED IT",negative
"This show is better than breaking bad and game of thrones combined. The acting is good, the story is good, the dialogues are good, there has not been one point I have been bored. They have not made a single mistake everything lines up perfectly. Rami Malek (who plays the main character called Elliot) is perfect for the role he plays. And all other actors fit perfectly fine in their role too. I can not think of one thing that is not done perfect in this show. Like I say in the title this show has been a joy to watch. At this moment the show is at episode 9 and I think there is only one episode left in this season but this show is not breakable for me anymore. My rating an 10 out of 10.For me the best show of 2015.",positive
"Each episode is like a never ending stair case, it keeps raising the bar. Insane! Rami's acting is spectacular. I've never wrote a review about an actor's job but wow. A TV show that is not fantasy. A show that is based on possible ideas and it gets rated 10!! Yes we love Game of Thrones and All IMDb's top 10-100 shows but what are most of those shows? ""Back in 1800's"" ""Dragons and Fantasy"" ""crime and cops"" right? Well this is a genre of its own. Literally what genre would you put this? Watch every episode. S3e06 one of the best episodes of TV series. 10/10 watch the episode. This is probably one of the greatest episodes of TV history.Appreciate it. Love it.",positive
"I really don't get what people find so captivating about this series.I mean, I do get that the general premise is OK, but man did it take long for things to ACTUALLY happen... Seasons 2 and 3 were completely empty, unneeded. Even without them it's a huge drag. This could have easily been a great 2 hour movie.Except for a few details, this was a snooze fest with some ""televisa presenta"" moments.Decent acting and directing in some scenes is almost everything this show has going for it. I wish I didn't keep giving it a chance. I thought I would miss something if I stopped, and i was very, very wrong.",negative
"This show was just epic, both in terms of story building and scenario, as well as acting especially of Rami Malek. Its rather dark and deep plot never seizes to amaze you as it goes on building from episode to episode, keeping you in agony of what's coming up next, while you definitely can't imagine clearly what's really going on in the protagonist's head until the end of the 4th season. One of the best tv shows ever!",positive
"For the last few decades, directors have focused on puzzling viewers, rathen than simply telling stories. This is one of them, a mix of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde and Fight Club. I dont know you but personally I am fed up with these ""it-was-all-a-dream"", ""things-happened-in-his-mind"" or ""not-he-but-his-alter-ego-did-these"" type of productions. This is the last type but in this case there is one (wait was it two?) alter ego, plus mind-created personas of a dad, a mom and a young Elliot. Moreover Chinese Minister has also double identity. Is it not too much?! Apart from this downside (which constitutes 3/4 of the series), it is a fine and watchable one.",positive
"What a gem and what a trip. This show messes with your head but you love it. Last season has been one of my favourite things to watch for some time!
Mr. Robot deserves more attention and people should just start watching it without any doubts.",positive

"There is a tendency to over-score American drama series, especially when compared to superlative European drama and indeed comedy. The opening episode of Mr Robot hints at greatness. A thoughtful concept capturing some of the 'David vs high tech big data corporate Goliath'zeitgeist. The script is rich and the production doesn't betray the concept. However, as the season progresses, Mr Robot gets more complex and there start to be more questions posed than answers given. This doesn't mean Mr Robot can't go on to be a great drama, but rather that season 1 has set the scene and that season 2 needs to build and credibily resolve the outstanding questions. There are some great acting performances. Cristian Slater has been brilliant since True Romance. The Swedish wife is chilling, both in terms of beauty and personality. I hope Mr Robot reaches its potential. But season 1 has promise and I've scored it based on this.",positive
"Elliot roll is brilliant, he suffers with paranoid delusions and is obsessed with the terribleness of the world.Season 1 to 3 are ma favorites but when they released season 4 I was so excite. But, no more surprise I was getting so bored. The story line was good actually but I don't know I got bored. Last 3-4 episode are just waste of time. Apart from those things I'll gonna remember this mr.robot ma whole life.",positive
After watching first two episodes it was obvious that Mr. Robot was Tyler Durden. It is unoriginal and total rip-off. Don't waste your time.,negative
"Season 1 of Mr Robot absolutely floored me. I was not expecting the turns this genius, incredible show took.Episode 1 contains one of the greatest openings...ever. The perfect balance of high tension and darker-than-black comedy is genuinely astounding in how measured they are to one another, and this absolutely knocked it out of the park within the first 5 minutes alone.The satirical elements of the show, at first, came across as a little too 'we live in a society' for my taste, however, the show sharply turns self aware shortly after it's initial episodes, making it all the more hilarious...and scarily poignant.The highlight episodes for me have to be 4, 7, 8, & 9, purely in how it crosses the bridges of everything from Lynchian mysteries such as Twin Peaks or Mulholland Drive, to the psychological drama of, most notably, Fight Club.Stellar.",positive
"Definitely one the best pilot episodes out there, but from the third ep. they lost it completely. Hack side of the story is not too bad, but they have had to make it more personal, not blend bunch of different stories into a complete mess. Making it more of a personal struggle within Elliot like in Pilot episode. ""Saving the world from evil corporations"" has become too lame to write about.My biggest objection about the TV show is quasi-hacktivist women, lame Hollywood love stories and really bad acting shown by Carly Chaikin and Portia Doubleday. Former mentioned bitchiness is so childish it makes me sick while watching scenes with her. ""I am menace to the world!"" What the f...? Her ""relationship"" with Cisco < lame, who is working with ""Dark Army"", lmao. Whole thing's just stepping over my threshold of stupidity.Latter mentioned simply doesn't fit the show. She acts and looks like she is in the Legally Blonde film.One more thing is really disturbing me, political correctness is overdone. What's with all the homosexuality, and all-races included thing. I really don't care if they're all white, black, Asian, Muslim, Christian or Hindu. Just tell the freakin' story well. Are we only interested in following the trends? Silicon Valley is at least fun to watch.",negative
"All the other reviews pretty much say it all, but what I fail to understand is this: the story is about a networking wizard, yet there is an elementary mistake in the pilot. episode I know common people can't notice it, and it's not really relevant for the storyline, but then this show was not exactly made for common people. Can there PLEASE be a TV show, once, in the history of television, where there aren't impossible IP addresses? It is basic stuff! In a computer related show, this kind of a mistake is like - dunno - trying to write a script for a western where cowboys wear kevlar and use tactical nukes. If you can look past many technical ... imperfections, it's a solid show. I'm giving it 7/10 for now.",positive

"Watched the pilot on a whim and was completely engaged in the first three minutes, and the next sixty-one that followed just kept building on that initial engagement.Excellent writing with actual attention to technical detail with minimal dumbing down, and exceptional acting from the lead, who managed to pull off detached, alienated, and utterly charismatic all at once).Cinematography was solid throughout, with the palette and framing reflecting the lead's mental state, surreal camera work during the final sequence, and tons of background details adding to the immersion and fleshing out of the world in which the main character exists.I genuinely can't remember the last time I felt so immediately and fully invested in a television show and so eager to see the next episode...PLEASE give this one a try and spread the word!",positive
"Finally a series that points out how our society is. Sam Esmail fearlessly points out the state of the present scenario of the society that is being swallowed by the corporate world. A hacker faced with the dilemma of going with the flow or going against the flow, Rami Malek portrays Elliot Anderson with a great ease that confuses the audience with the fact whether Rami Malek is actually the character. This film also portrays all walks of the society and the problems related to it. This complete series enlighten the audience with the fact that the corporate world rules, while the common folks are just cattle that is being tamed by the boss, the corporate world itself. The series also portrays the people's dilemma in accepting their sexuality and their fear for coming out with the truth.This show deserves all the appreciation because it ACTUALLY deserves. Unlike showing up some fantasy world that consists of dragons and nudity, depicting present scenario exactly as it is, that is some bold attempt that deserves appreciation. The acting has been well done. Other than some reckless casting, and some negligible mistakes, this show is in fact good and i recommend people reading this to watch it.",positive
"Like many others, I was rather disappointed of season 2 of Mr. Robot. At times season 2 was fantastic, but it felt like many scenes, and some episodes were so slow paced that the show didn't seem like it was going to improve. Towards the end of the second season however, it definitely removed any doubts in my mind. With a killer series finale I couldn't wait for season 3.After just finishing the third season I can happily say it was worth the wait. Not a single dull episode in this season. With tremendous character arcs, cinematography and plot, this season has been a masterpiece. This was the Mr Robot I expected after the first season.",positive
"nothing is perfect. humans always get disappointed by the imperfection of something then they criticize or they turn their backs. including this show, it's not a perfect thing to watch or to enjoy so you'll might unlike the show or turn your back if you want to watch the show from the beginning. to me the show isn't perfect either but the story is excellent. thats the thing that kept me watching all episodes of season 1. sometimes i don't care about imperfection, so i give 10 for the ratings of this show because the story is excellent. i know there are many movies or shows that show people about hack (so it is mainstream already) but i've never seen any appropriate show or appropriate movie that appropriately shows me that hack can change our world our life, hack can be an act of heroism, hack can save humans and how dangerous it is for humans (including me). the main story of the show is to take down a big company by hack, a big company that has a very big influence on economy. we know that producers have to create many episodes for a TV show so you'll see other things on this TV show about psychological disorder, drugs, romance, relationships, the characters' life, works etc. the main actor is perfect for the main character of this show. he's not a beautiful man like the main actor of the flash (how could you think a hacker has got to be a beautiful person?) but he's so perfect for Mr Robot. he did a perfect job for the show.the other reason i give ten is that there are so many quotes or speeches that touch me very much. f**k society.",positive
"When I watched the pilot I was excited. This show seemed very promising; a big eyed hacker hidden in a hoodie with a strange nervous tic confronted a person with his dubious behavior on the internet, while in the meantime showing the viewer how good of a hacker he is himself. It was slick, savvy, convincing, like a lone cowboy on the vast plains of the internet, riding his laptop whilst shooting firewalls to pieces.Already in the second episode I was getting a bit frustrated about the direction it was taking and this got worse as the show dragged on. Instead of focusing on what I thought was going to be the plot in the pilot (a hackers group similar to Anonymous taking on the big corporations), the plot focused on the hacker's personal problems, addictions and his love life. This could've been OK sub-stories, but as the main plot it couldn't hold it together at all.Result: missed chance on what could've been a great show.",negative
The movie started out OK but then it changed into drug addiction and became very depressing to watch so we stopped watching. Too many facial close-ups and mondaine narration. The show is a face with a black hoodie talking nonsense.After seeing all the great reviews I think I might try to weather the storm and watch the rest of it .,negative
"I loved the show from the very beginning and it was a gripping show until the very end...when they had to ruin it. Oh, ""Elliot is not really Elliot, it's just one of his many personalities""...well duh, of course it is, why else would he have so many memory loopholes...plus this one is the ""mastermind"" hiding the real one asleep somewhere in the subconsciousness. I guess this kind of finale fits the young generations not acquainted with story-lines written pre Y2K. Shame really. The show deserved a way better and way more meaningful ending. I really wish I hadn't watched the very last episode. Giving it 7 stars only AND ONLY because the first 3 seasons were amazing.

"Everything about it is different from any other series I've seen. Intense,dark,confusing and breath taking.",positive
"I initially liked the show because it matches lots of my philosophical view. However, I fell in love with it because, in my opinion, it's a piece of art. This show just oozes art from every aspect. You can produce a good show, that the majority of people would like and enjoy, without being artistic (except for the basics - storyline and acting). In Mr. Robot, however, you can clearly see that an extra mile has been gone at every aspect just to make it a piece of art. I'm not going to talk about details about how the plot is good or any basic necessities that makes a show good. This show is a masterpiece and it's pleasant to immerse yourself into every aspect of it. Highly recommended.",positive
"This starts off great, really amazing actually best thing I'd watched on tv. Hackers, evil corporations, crooks, villains and heroes. Awesome Then it became stilted, slow and written terribly finally and hopefully ending for good, in a weird montage of shocking acting, cheap cliffhangers. But, and it is a big but. It is not short on action, adventure and suspense. I'd not go through it again though. It could have been amazing but for the...long pauses. See if you like it and stop watching when you want though. You won't miss a thing!",negative
"I gave a 7/10 rating. To explain, having watched the show halfway through the second season, I would give it a 9/10 for writing, intelligence, and character development among other qualities. But here's the thing: I hate every single character. I want them all to get caught, exposed, and wiped. I suppose that is part of the, um, attraction?",positive
"I started watching Mr. Robot when it first premiered but never had time to continue watching. I just completed Season 4 and can say unequivocally that I wish there were more. First, the cast is simply superb,. From leads Rami Malek, Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin, Grace Gummer, B. D. Wong, Martin Wallstrom, and Portia Doubleday to the supporting cast, including Michael Cristofer, Gloria Reuben, Joey Bada$$, Bobby Cannavale, and Elliot Villar, Mr. Robot is a master class. Second, the concept of the uneven distribution of wealth not only in this country but across the globe is both a timely and a frightening one. Third, Elliot's personality disorder, rooted in childhood trauma, is not a fantasy but a terrifying reality for many. Mr. Robot's themes and storytelling style may not be for everyone; if that were true, brain-dead reality television programming would not be so popular. But if you are willing to focus while you watch and put aside your various devices for an episode or two, you might be drawn into the world of Mr. Robot as I was. Please set aside the scathing, unfair negative reviews and give this excellent series a try.",positive
"It offers sucha an accurate depiction of the hacking world right now. Of writing simply scripts in python and everything. I do however think the multiple personality disorder was pushing it too far, it's on the verge of being ""too much"" trying too much",positive
This is one of the best TV series/Movies just because it's so real ;) Thats all I have to say and look who's saying ... 10*! -Best 2017 TV Series (after got :)) ) -Best Hackers TV Series (close to reality) If someone is smart they will learn from it ...and that's good and bad as well,positive

"When good friend of mine came to me and asked me if i watched Mr.Robot and I answered no he started talking and complimenting on this TV Series. I was intrigued and promised I will watch it right after I finish my exams. Well, the day before my exams started i saw the trailer and i couldn't take it out of my mind. So, I watched when I had exams but I have got no regrets. This TV Show is a masterpiece!I am more into Movies and not much to TV Series but if it is ""Mr.Robot"", things change. This is what all ""Fight Club"" fans have been waiting for. and release of ""Mr.Robot"" is exactly what we needed while all going around the world. I thank the creators of ""Mr.Robot"" for making it. We are the Fsociety!",positive
"I just want to say that the 4th season of this show has sealed its place alongside The Wire & The Americans when it comes to my favorite TV dramas of all-time.It really bums me out that the show never moved beyond a cult. I re-watched each of the first 3 seasons before starting in on this one, and watches them in quick succession (with future context in mind) emphasized just how tightly written every moment is.Some people may not like Season 2 as much, but it's actually my favorite. And I venture that time will be kind to it. Its biggest problem was that half of Mr. Robot's initial audience was there for a techno thriller instead of the heady character study buried underneath S1. And so those people bailed, and USA's failure to put Mr. Robot up onto streaming in a timely manner (combined with the extended waits between each season) prevented the show from building momentum or adding to its audience.I have faith that Esmail will stick the landing. And I'm grateful that USA was the network to green light this show. Because it was in their best interest (as a less prestigious and rather aimless network) to see through the show to the end when many others might have pulled the plug (see what happened to The OA).Hopefully more people will find this wonderful piece of art with time.For fans of: David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, American Psycho, unreliable narrators, Donnie Darko, Legion, jaw dropping cinematography, character studies.",positive

"I had heard about Mr. Robot from a couple of impressed friends. It turned out to be intriguing, and entertaining. I specially loved the character Elliot, who is a very original creation.However, two things bothered me while watching season one. Elliot has a disorder that repulses him of physical contact. Yet, somehow, he manages to ""sleep"" with women. The more potent disappointment was the buildup to the plot. I could not help but draw parallels from the movies, Fight Club and V for Vendetta. Although the series appears to impress most novice movie (TV Series) goers, I feel that it lacks originality and consistency. .",negative
"I want to say congratulations to Sam Esmail and anyone who has written this show. This is by far one of the best shows I've ever seen, and if it continues with this quality it will become my favorite drama (along with Breaking Bad, of course...) The tech talk doesn't make me want to punch something (which never happened before).. Usually, these shows make hacking look like a video game, this one doesn't. I've read the pilot and it's the best pilot I've read (http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Mr_Robot_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf). Great job! Please keep this show coming. This could easily be the next Breaking Bad / Dexter. Wonderful job.Congrats, this one's a keeper :)",positive
"Full-on dissociative identity or multiple/split personality disorder isn't common, but there are less drastic ways a person will partially lose or subdivide their personality. That's why it's not important to diagnose Elliot of Mr. Robot. As complex as his mental health case is, he's still relatable to a sizable population of ""normal"" or merely eccentric folks in the real world.The realistic elements of the contemporary context are important to connecting with viewers, as well. Similarly themed projects often draw on hyperbolic, farther-fetched sci-fi elements, or they project out into the future, just a bit, so they can include technological extrapolations (e.g. Minority Report, Black Mirror, The Feed). As for Mr. Robot, it creates an intrigue on par with strong sci-fi, but the context rings true, though sometimes caricatured or artistically simplified.Mr. Robot's abilities on a keyboard, though, and his resilience against defeat, might be enough to label him a clearly fictional hero, though he's dramatically flawed. He's more believable and relatable than Batman or Mission Impossible type stuff. Quite the opposite, some viewers may be prone to loving the character, not something associated with caped avengers.The creator, Sam Esmail, avoided overuse of Elliot's capabilities as a means to create tension or grandeur. Again, no, the focus stays on Elliot figuring himself out, all the while a far-reaching plot goes on through and and round him. Still, if no part of Elliot parallels some aspect of your life, the journeys of the supporting characters very well may. His sister, the FBI agent, the man in the hall Elliot regrets having to emotionally eviscerate . . . There are a multiplicity of sub dramas that touch on most any way humans experience pain or trauma.Elliot later gets to apologize to that man in the hall. All he did was talk the man into dropping pretenses about himself, though, which may not have been a bad thing in the long run. Elliot is always just trying to make things right for himself and everyone on the earth. If he lapses, he's trying to cope with things that are overwhelming and mysterious inside his own self. Sometimes circumstances and his personal vulnerabilities get the better of him.Restorative justice, though, might be hard to achieve for at least a few things Mr. Robot does on Elliot's behalf (the murder of Romero, a co-conspirator, sticks in my mind). But Elliot remains a sympathetic character in great part because his flaws are generally relatable. I favored believing in that plenty enough to suspend disbelief in the more fantastic or unbelievably convenient plot points. And that's being harsh on the show. If there were holes, I didn't see them because it was worth it to me not to, so someone else will have to judge the technicals.The computer hacking and such is fascinating, actually. But I focused on Elliot's inner mission, and I think that's what Esmail intended.Elliot is trying very, very hard. That's relatable for a lot of folks, too, who are struggling with both themselves and the world, and just wishing they can manage to do the right thing, to make the right choices.Lots of people experience social anxiety, depression, bipolar . . .. Depersonalization or derealization, too, describe when someone feels disconnected from themselves or their surroundings. I, myself, have sequestered parts of myself or alternated faces to handle various perceived crises. I've used that strategy since I was four years old, but a seeming tragedy recently helped make me whole again.There are some who the show probably disturbed; I don't doubt it. Despite its dark themes, it's entertaining, captivating, and a good story, I would think, even for those who don't need it as therapy. But the intent of the show wasn't just to either disturb or entertain. During on episode, a number is displayed on the screen to call if the viewer or someone they know is suicidal. For me, in particular, the show, itself, not the number, came at just the right time, not while I was in crisis, but at a time I was reading to follow the map back to wholeness.A person can loose track of parts of themselves, or fail to control themselves the way they'd like. Sudden, inexplicable anger or sadness are sometimes among the symptoms, regardless of remorse. Splintering one's personality to internally cope with external pressures is traumatic in it's own way. It's fraught with inexplicable guilt, sadness, and angst which come seemingly out of nowhere and sometimes most inopportune.Rugens and Terhune summarize other scholars in saying, ""The tendency to experience dissociative states characterized by disruptions between the normally integrated systems of attention, awareness, memory and identity (trait dissociation) is a reliable predictor of state dissociation during or following trauma (peritraumatic dissociation). There is evidence that negative emotional states may mediate this relationship.""Though this is what starts the article on this very complex topic, I wonder how my own experiences are affecting my interpretation, because I feel like I understand nearly every word of that, though I'm not a psychologist, neurologist, or any nearby -ist. Mental illness is sometimes necessary as a means of survival.I perceive another individual, sometimes, as a proud soul who thoroughly loves themselves, knows who they are, and finds equilibrium in life pretty much all the time. That's not me. That's not lots of folks. And maybe I'm merely fooled by bubbly extroverts; everybody goes through something. We just handle it differently and have differing approaches to self-assessment. Self-esteem and self-worth are central to human function, and yet, capitalism, media, and culture erodes and complicate, perhaps more often than they support stability and self-love. Some cases get so complex and threatening that a person has to divide themselves in order to live to fight another day.Rugens and Terhune had fifty graduate students and their professors stare at themselves in the mirror. Prior to the experiment, none of the participants self-reported any mental illness. However, the researchers were able to elicit and measure dissociative responses in those formally educated, ""sane"" people. Merely by making them look at their own reflections. Saying guilt-laden phrases to the participants made them dissociate according to the data. More precisely, what they find is that guilt ""moderates the relationship between dissociative tendencies and dissociative states."" That's not a new finding. Back in 1998 H J Irwin wrote that guilt and shame ""contribute significantly to the prediction of dissociative tendencies.""It's not usually possible to make things 100% right and explained, especially when others wrong us or take advantage of our vulnerabilities. Perhaps we ""enjoy"" blaming ourselves, in that we can control that and apply whatever penalties to ourselves that we see fit.I think, for me, I needed to reach a point where I could read myself like a book or look in the mirror casually, without something of myself hiding under the counter. To not see failures or injustices as random, but, rather, as meaningful destiny. A person can choose whether to let someone else's actions outright identify them, but they can't escape such realities entirely. ""No comment"" is not an option.There's a spectrum of distortions short of someone making a full break with themselves. Regardless, reintegration probably won't happen without a person forgiving themselves. That much is clear.For Elliot, finding that required that he not give up, though he sometimes gave in. He returned to seeking resolution no matter what. And that's what redeemed him: his need to be whole and right despite so many things tearing him apart.Ultimately, the show is a supremely articulated (to me) and timed (for me) request that I unify or consolidate my personality and abandon projected or internalized artifice apart from its proper uses.People call that being authentic or real, which are apt, except that artifice is real, too, and I don't want to confuse or muddle such an important thing as treating one's self with the utmost respect and wishing good for all the world.Just as someone writing about a show that last dropped an episode three years ago, Mr. Robot could confuse. A person could get the wrong idea. There's nothing nefarious, though, once the show is considered in its totality.Nonetheless, as I got into the first few episodes, I had to overlook derivative concepts on loan from The Matrix, Fight Club, Person of Interest, etc . . .. As the story develops, I found these loaner ideas were used creatively and productively.I also stuck it out through the seemingly cliché and yet sometimes controversial themes and plot points: sex, drugs, computer hacking, mental illness, terrorism, corporate villainy, the idea of sheeple, bleak imagery . . .. My taste and disposition only sometimes tolerate such things, but it became easier and easier to do so as I picked up more of the breadcrumbs.When a person has partitioned themselves internally due to some extraordinary stress or complexity, it can be hard for them to stabilize their mood and feel they even understand themselves. And it can be hard to put everything all back together once it's been taken apart . . . If the sufferer even realizes what they've done to themselves in an effort to cope.Elliot switches between various sub-personalities at times. Other times he merely censors himself for the wrong reasons and with limited self-awareness. But he plays detective on his own self as he also navigates extraordinary circumstances.His greatest accomplishment comes when he stops fighting what's wrong in the world and within, and finally finds his way to letting himself be fully present. He also comes to see people like his sister as special in that they loved him despite that he'd pushed them away.",positive
"This is, what I consider to be a perfect show. A lot of the first 2 seasons of the show is a little slow, I'll admit. But it is still great. I don't think there is a bad episode on this show. The last 2 seasons are beyond perfect. The action is exciting, the acting phenomenal, the score is great and especially the cinematography. The cinematography in this show is so god damn good its crazy.",positive
"Watched alone over the past several months. Started strong in season 1, decent season 2, however took a break before starting season 3. It was good when I got round to watching, but ultimately it led to season 4 which I found gripping (maybe as I have just finished it). Couldn't wait to watch the next episode throughout the season, and the season ended with both pure
satisfaction, and that sense of sadness that another great series has come to an end :(",positive
Not to be missed. A brilliant current combo of the sopranos the matrix and more. Forget the Queen movie. Rami is so unbelievably brilliant here as is Slater as well as the scripts and direction. Absolutely not to be missed. Should be absorbed slowly as the plot is sophisticated. I have not seen s4 yet. But s3 finally incredible.,positive
"The first season was great, really entertaining, great acting, beautiful actresses, interesting story line that parallels real life. It has some dark themes to it, and I feel like this accurately, as far as a Hollywood show could portray, Hacktivism, White Hat, and Black Hat etc. Rami Malek really carries the show. Christian Slater is really dull and lackluster though. Not sure if it is intentional for him to be like that. But Honestly he could be portrayed by an other actor and that would be fine. Season not 2 really kind of drags on and I find my mind wandering, and by season 3 I was completely uninterested. Overall I give it 8 stars because I did find it entertaining and thought provoking. There were some scenes they could of left out or replaced and I would give it 10.",positive
"I think the internal dialog of the main character is intriguing, (reminiscent of Dexter). I think there is fertile ground to develop this story far beyond the limited thinking of the previous critic. I also like slow character development in the series I watch. I just hope the writers are able to hold back their enthusiasm with the ideas that they having with this series. I hope they don't just give it all away in the second episode for ratings.(comment to the creators and writers. Everyone can see its Chrisitian Slater... He's a brilliant actor, but he hasn't changed his look in 20 years. He should really risk his image a little to give his own personal acting persona depth. a scar or a tattoo, or or a limp or something as a clue to something deeper, his motivation. Any way.... Just saying... I like the series very much.I think its got a 10 season feel to it, just hold it together.",positive
"I'm writing this with my mind suitably blown. Sure, it seems like they dragged it on for 4 seasons and the Americans sure know how to fluff something up, but I just watched a video (link below) that explains something my distracted mind would've found hard to grasp. It's made the series all the more delicious, knowing how much I missed.",positive
"Now, I don't usually write reviews, but just the pilot of this series leaves me no other choice.It's intelligent, it's dark, at times it feels a little ""Fight Club""-esque in all the right ways, it's fast paced but not overly hurried.In short: It takes its audience seriously, and most importantly doesn't shy away from being complex, especially in the technical area. While most ""bad elite hacker""-plots usually just serve to make everyone halfway familiar with a terminal cringe painfully, it seems the writers in this case did their homework (well, as much as it's feasible for a show that's still trying to be entertainment rather than a hacking documentary). With just a bit more story, the pilot alone felt as if it could have been a full-length movie, despite only being the prelude to a promising plot. And there is hope that, like with other rather gloomy-themed series (like Fargo, True Detective or Marvel's Daredevil), the already quite vivid characters will gain in complexity later on.So, consider me sold. I'm really looking forward to the next episode, and so should you.",positive
"The spoilers in this will almost entirely be benign. Spoiler free review: Good show, give it a shot if you like the premise.Spoiler review: The reason I was interested in this was because the description provided by IMDb. Specifically the words ""mysterious anarchist"" jumped out at me because I'm an Anarchist, as well as having anti- socialproblems and live on computers most of my life. You could say it hit atrifecta with me and thus I was interested, but worried. I was right tobe worried, but my concerns probably wont matter to most people.I'll start off with the good. The main character is Elliot, played by Rami Malek. I've never heard of him before, but based solely on his performance in this single episode I'm interested in seeing more of his work. He plays the part of an anxious, withdrawn introvert very well. He looks the part and acts the part marvelously. From the looks of things, there's a strong possibility his performance can carry this program for quite a while(in my ignorant opinion).I really enjoyed the thought put into the characters, the setting, and set up. The techno-babble is kept to a minimum, which I like because then I don't want to have to deal with script writers ignorance(say, by having two people type on the same keyboard at the same time). However, since the whole story revolves around technology, we're going to be subjected to a lot of it. I expect to take it with a grain of salt and not expect too much, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.The troubling part is that this TV series is decidedly left wing from the beginning. This bothers me because politics is a large part of my life and if I start hating the message a TV series or movie is giving me, it will absolutely poison the end product.Much talk is given to Evil Corp, the company that Elliot works for tangentially. Evil Corp is evil because...well, for reasons, I suspect. However good those reasons are, they're not told to us. Instead, we're given a montage of other people doing bad things(Steve Jobs making money off the backs of children) and expected to hate Evil Corp because...they provide a product people want and make money while doing it? What bastards! How dare they do what everyone in the economy does!?I'm sure later in the series we'll learn they gave people cancer and then sold them a cure or something, but the warning sign is in the poster at the top of this page. ""Our Democracy has been hacked!"" Has it really? No words are given to the evils of government, the show only talks about the evils of the market, thus leading me to conclude that the government is a hapless victim in all of this. Those poor politicians, they had not choice but to accept bribes and kick backs. They certainly didn't connive to create a system where people with money would have to give them that money in order to keep what they've earned. No, they're just off trying to give money to poor people or puppies while the mean business men are trying to ""hack"" the government. The government is the victim, the corporation is the evil doer.Yawn.I don't expect this to get better. I've been bothered in the past by USA network and their left-wing bias. They always have a message, but I was hoping this time the message would be incidental. Instead, I fear we're going to be seeing a message masquerading as a TV show before too long.",positive
"I know there were some unanswered question after the season finale but the creator was able to give the proper ending.
There was some ups and down but after all it was truly worth it. We started as a part of the show and somehow they managed to give a proper seat in this show giving us the perfect angle and proper configuration to enjoy the show and after all we became a part of it.
They used some beautiful camera angles and frames was mind blowing and after a proper mystery when ever they explained anything it always came as a shock and I was able to felt it. I guarantee you if you ever feel bored watching this just hang on a little cause if you stop watching in the middle you might miss one of the greatest show of the era.
As I said this series is an example for other creater may be it is different from popular tv shows but after all it will be worth watching.",positive
This series is for separate kind of people. Some of the time I can match my lifestyle with the main character of this series. First two seasons are slow but after that it will give you a another taste. Love this series. Eliot,positive
"Wow really wow, show is so complex and unique I give it 100/10! Seasone one really complex and you are in middle of nothing, season two some parts are coming on place were they belong. I like the show and like how Sam Esmail represent the story from his real life. Best show ever created!",positive
"Possibly one of the most boring shows I have ever seen... It certainly doesn't keep your attention, the pilot was great. I thought that it would be something I could enjoy watching as another show to watch however it is a disappointment and a bore. Nothing much happens with little explanation as to what happens when it does. And the characters are all round underdeveloped. Scenes are dragged out as much as possible with increased amount of filler as the series continues leaving the viewer just displeased with the time they have wasted watching it. The originality is what got me at first but now I see why it is original. I shall not be continuing with this series.",negative
"More liberal, Marxist, millennial appealing Hollywood crap.Everybody is gay, married men with children clearly fool around with other men in the ass according to the show, no biggie.Corporations and money is the root of all evil and 20 years old hipsters are society's salvation, it's all about some revolution, right folks?The world is unfair to me, we're all victims and must fight patriarchy oppression.Trump is literally Hitler.",negative
"Mr robot is challenging to go trough but oh so worth it to watch all the way. An excellent and unpredictable story, brilliant character work, believable performances, and stylish visuals.First season was a great start as the pilot is a 10/10. And yeah some of the episodes are there to keep the pacing in check, but it will constantly reward you in the end and climax.But the weakest part I would have to say is the second season as I say it's the one with the the most filler, but it is definitely worth it to go through as it rewards you with an excellent twist and shocking cliffhanger .The third season is where the show gets it amazing status. It is amazing, perfectly continuing the story and the pacing is perfect. 10 episodes and all of them are necessary. Not to mention some where near the midpoint there is an episode entirely shot or is giving the illusion of being shot in one take and it is thrilling. Not to mention the midpoint was also shocking as well.Oh yeah the last season. Um..... it's near perfect. The only problem I have with is the episode 410 gone which just slows it down to focus on some other thing. But either way 405 method not allowed, 407 proxy authentication required, 409 conflict, eXit, whoami and Hello Elliot are just perfect television episodes. With whoami and Hello Eliot being a perfect ending to the series, with revealing a twist so risky but so rewarding.So yeah the first 2 seasons are flawed it oh so rewarding and the last 2 seasons are perfect(kinda) so yeah. Decent 10/10.",positive
"I had high hopes after the first episode but it all started falling apart mid-season. There were still ways to save it up until the 9th episode where the most interesting possible plot twist I was hoping for was dismissed through confirmed mental issues of the character in question. I can't believe they threw away the opportunity.What I was expecting, and I can't stress enough how much of a spoiler this is, was for Tyrell to flip earlier in the series before going all murder happy. Elliot's father would have faked his own death through hacking and some elaborate means of covering the physical gap that leaves behind. The father and son team would've assimilated all important characters from the plot and brought a peaceful end to Evil corp at the end of the first season. Season 2 could've covered Evil corp rising from the ashes, but fortunately I don't care anymore.Instead we're left with anarchy, drug abuse and mental issues to milk the fan base for another season. I'm abandoning this series, I have lost all faith in the story.",negative
"This is one of my favorite shows of all time.It is such a thrill ride, clever writing, acting is superb. Camera and Sound Track phenomenal. What I like about it is the many twists (but not too many) and how it keeps you on your toes.I can't think of one actor on this show who hasn't done a brilliant job.",positive
"What a perfect view of the computer industry in the real modern world. The lead actor performs so well and mind-boggling that you get pulled into the story and forget everything around you. The beautiful soundtrack adds to the tension and mystery this show delivers. Great performance from especially Rami Malek and Portia Doubleday, the attraction between them does not interfere with the story-line and is not at all distracting but adds additional excitement to this great series. Since I am dutch it's hard for me to find the right words for this review of this fantastic new TV show but I hope you understand that this is simply new, innovative, very original, compelling and addictive. I can't wait for more... dutch robin",positive
This show works on so many levels and as a result you really don't need to be into computers or hacking etc.. to enjoy. If you do know your networks you will find that it stays within the boundaries of reality unlike many hacking shows/movies. If you remove the geeky elements you are still left with a gripping drama with good expected and unexpected twists. Great casting (I'm a Slater fan but beyond that aspect of it the actors really do the character justice. The writing is also strong and I personally like that they do try to keep the hacking aspects fairly believable.Definitely worth a try!,positive
"Mr. Robot is a new series airing Wednesday nights on USA. Created by Sam Esmail, the new drama series stars Rami Malek as Elliot Alderson an anti-social technological genius. In this provocative and captivating story, Elliot (Malek) dreams of saving the world by exacting his own brand of justice. We get a glimpse into the mind of Elliot (Malek) through his narrative in which he shares his disgust with society as a whole and the belief that there is a conspiracy amongst the most powerful, ""the ones who play God without permission."" His idea of how to save the world comes to fruition when he uses his hacking abilities and his job as a Computer Security Engineer enabling him to level the playing field. Grabbing the attention of a mysterious vigilante group led by Mr. Robot (Cristian Slater), Elliot is presented with an intriguing opportunity he finds appealing yet, stands in direct conflict with the standards he has devised for himself. The decision Elliot makes is one that could result in a drastic turn of events.I found Mr. Robot to be a fascinating and riveting story that held my attention entirely throughout the episode. Rami Malek is exceptionally talented at portraying the flawed and eccentric Elliot while captivating the characters humanity in his quest to right the wrongs within the confines of inequality amongst the masses. I particularly look forward to the back-story that was subtlety revealed about Elliot's childhood and the apparent dark world that he has known and how that has molded him into the man he is now. The little bit of Elliot's history that we get to see said much about the characters behavior and the reasons for why Elliot makes the choices he does without actually saying a word.Supporting cast members Cristian Slater as Mr. Robot himself and Michel Gill (Gideon Goddard) best known for his portrayal of President Garrett Walker in ""House of Cards,"" are interesting characters that drive the story forward and are idiosyncratic to the plot. An example of this being when Gideon (Gill) the owner of Allsafe Cyber Security and the always-consummate boss, reveals his more vulnerable human side ""coming out"" to Elliot and attesting to his fear of the possibility he could lose everything he's worked for.With all the new drama series coming out this Summer I highly recommend Mr. Robot to be one you will want to add to the top of your watch list. In fact, I predict Mr. Robot will be the best new drama series this year and I would not be surprised to see a number of Emmy nominations including Best Actor in a Drama Series for Rami Malek for the 68th Emmy Awards Ceremony. Judging by the pilot episode alone, gives every indication that Mr. Robot is going to unfold a superb and absorbing story that will have viewers clamoring for more of TV's, soon to be, new favorite anarchist.",positive
"It's a show about a mentally ill person whose dangerous mental illness is ignored by his friends, sister and therapist which ultimately leads to the death of a few of his friends and many many extras.First season is actually decent but at its end starts the Mr. Robot nonsense which turns the show from a story about a hacker to a story about a mentally ill person and his illusions, dreams and nightmares. The viewer gets cheated with the aforementioned illusions which the protagonist experiences and bad ""surprises"" countless times, up until the very end.What's really disappointing though is that the show leaves us with many loose ends, unexplained characters arcs and motives, unexplained subplots, abandoned plot lines etc. Also the show features too many characters with ""broken"" sexualities that makes it extra unbelievable - the promiscuous bisexual who has a boyfriend but also sleeps with random strangers and gets pissed at his boyfriend for proposing to her, the woman who looks like a guy and gets in sexual relationships with guys, the closeted gay man who is married with an attractive woman but sleeps with some random muslim for an unexplained reason, the wife of the closeted gay man who likes BDSM and cheats on him with some random guy, the gay boss, the lesbian FBI agent, the guy who was sexually abused as a kid etc.There're also too many pointless scenes, such as Elliot and the annoying muslim kid, Elliot and the junkie who works at the Cyprus bank, Joana and his lover etc.And one more thing - the Mr. Robot character is extremely unlikeable and annoying.",negative
"This Serial is very interesting, Little by little, the story line becomes more interesting and the last chapter is officially considered a masterpiece.",positive
I've loved all 4 seasons of Mr. Robot but 3 and 4 are definitely the best of the bunch.Season 4 has been an epic journey so far. The only downside is waiting a week to find out what happens next. Once it's finished i'll be bingeing it all again.Rami Malek is brilliant as are the rest of the cast.,positive
"The series is very boring, and I do not advise anyone to watch it and I did not complete the first episode of the severity of boredom.",negative
"I've never wrote an IMDb review before, however I felt compelled to do so after finishing the 2-part series finale. Mr. Robot has transformed itself into one of the most thought-provoking, brilliant and entertaining shows of all time.I'm thankful I took a chance on a random show on USA network and saw it through. Beautifully done from some of the best lead acting I've ever seen to a supporting cast that pulsates throughout the series. Sam Esmail has crafted something so unique and beautiful, while being so dark and depressing, only someone with his passion and mind would be able to pull it off in this fashion. I look forward to re-watching this show in its entirety every few years.",positive
In the end mr. robot definitely earned one of the success http response codes. However none of the 2xx codes seem to be able to keep up with this series. Sam Esmail undertook us a heavy load test in season 4. Truely stunning!,positive
"Sorry but this is not for you if you are not totaly grounded, it centers around a guy who keeps going from 1 drug trip to another drug trip... with loads of psycological crap and mind twisters.... Including way to long psyco babble about what if this, what if that... To those who are already instable, this is not your show to watch!!If it was a show about a hacker group or a hacker who tried to battle the bad in the world, I would have loved it but al that psycho and drugs related psycho babble realy screwd it up for me....",negative
"This is an insanely good show. Like how Lost and Prison break started a new era, this seems to be doing something similar. First episode was great 2,3,4,5 was mediocre at best and I gave it a rating of seven. After 6th and 7th episode and the rating changed to nine and after watching 8th and 9th, I want to give it twelve if possible. The story is wholly original and the pace is brilliant. Crazy good acting from all characters, although sometimes seems contrived, but put it into context and it all makes sense. This show is more about a different world than we currently experience and the direction is definitely worthy of an applause. Great job and keep 'em coming!",positive
"This show tells the story of a hero in the IT angle of life accurately (which I've never seen such before). It also adds on the issue of the battles we fight are not only on the outside (the world, etc) but it is greater within ourselves (the psychotic problems). Plus, it connects directly to viewers as we play the imaginary friends of Elliot.It is a bit slow in pace which is both good and bad. Good thing is we are able to catch up on what is going on but u may fall asleep watching it.I couldn't imagine someone else playing Elliot better than Rami Malek so yes he deserves the Emmy. (not to mention those gorgeous eyes)Brilliant, unique and freshly psychotic. A Must See.",positive
"Got 30 minutes into SEASON 1: EPISODE 1.. the pilot for C's sake and had to puke it up. Keep stealing from the ones who create wealth and you'll run out of things to steal. Oh these poor blokes who ran themselves into debt buying satellite dishes, cell phones and TVs so they can watch shows like this and complain about battery life while they're watching. It's definitely the banker's fault.",negative
"Encouraged by the promos featuring Slater, we recorded 3 episodes before watching the pilot. Half-way through it we deleted all episodes. Who really want to watch a psycho hoodie aimlessly wander through the show, not us.The messages are clear that businesses are evil and are out-to-get all of us. Only a forthright honest savior such as Mr. Robot can save us from doomsday. If that is the case, then all is lost, Pointless show.BTW, what ever happen to Christian Slater? At first we thought the hoodie was a secondary character or one going to blow up something. What a disappointment.",negative
"Let me be honest. When I chose to watch this series, I didn't have much of hope. But as soon as watched the premier of first season, I know that this is gonna be one of the series that's going to top my list.The final episode of first season completes it with a bang and that says all about how good this series is and how good this series is going to be. I intentionally leave out the details of story, because I would like people, whoever decides to watch this series, to watch this series with a blank mind and experience the slow yet compelling ride the movie takes you. It is just awesome.I would, however, say that the casting is brilliant. The background music is brilliant. Each and every detail of the movie is carefully planned. Wow !! I'm so glad that I decided to watch this series.",positive
"I was intrigued by the first episode and hoped for more. By the third episode they tried to get real ""edgy"" and cool by doing the whole weird sex crap. If i wanted to watch ""broke back mountain"" or some other bondage and gay perversion sex, I'd looked elsewhere. It made me nauseous. -It's like every other show that thinks to be ""cool"" it has to show titties or ass or some such bullshit.Why do they even bother with stuff like this?Isn't a good plot enough?F*ck plot. Just show some ass. Good grief. Grow up.",negative
"It was suppose to be a top top notch cyber security show. Which mean the are suppose to be really careful with what they do. BUThe didn't wear gloves when planting raspberry pie. Then FBI found it. Where is the finger print part? Aren't they gonna do the finger print on that thing?They hacked a smart house, had a party. Which was okay. But again why on earth they were staying there like a brain dead monkey?There is more small details like that pissed me off so much. Other then that loved mr.robot part the whole illusion, dad thing.",negative
Yes Elliot and Mr. Robot are one and the same.This is produced by the same crew that produced Fight Club. It's a shame that they didn't have a more creative twist...you can see it coming from a mile away.This is produced by the same crew that produced Fight Club.

"Well, I have never wrote a review before, but this time I really had to, I've seen enough TV Series and I sincerely want to say that Mr.Robot got me more than every single other shows that I've personally seen. I think the actors were well chosen, everyone plays their role incredible, especial the main ones, I really love them all, absolutely amazing play by everyone, I probably sound like a really fanboy and probably I am, but I always dreamed about this kind of TV Series, never expected to be this well done, always thought it would be a ""meh"" or something boring as hell. Actually, right after the first episode I knew that this first season will have a lot of things in it, but it had way more than I personally expected, so many things happened in such a short time, and all of them were really well done, so that's a good thing in my opinion, meaning that they have many ideas on how to continue the show. The most amazing thing about this show is that everything that's on it, it's actually reality, I know that many of you knew that, but there are people who think that this is not happening in real life and it's just someone's imagination, just a TV Series, so I hope maybe this kind of show will open more eyes and I know it will. My favorite character is Martin Wallström aka Tyrell Wellick, why's that? Well, because he's the kind of guy most met in real life, a selfish, greedy, liar, ""ass-kisser"", impulsive or maybe just a psychopath. Right after him, comes the main character Rami Malek aka Elliot Alderson, he's really amazing, it actually reminds me a bit of a Dexter, the CD thing, how he talk to himself etc, really amazing character, also he's very calculated, unlucky that he turned into a junkie, but I hope he won't go back on crack again and stay clean. If I were supposed to make a top 3 favorite characters at least for the first season, it would be really hard for me, since the third place is really hard to give, Stephanie Corneliussen playing the character of Joanna Wellick and Christian Slater as Mr.Robot, I know my top is probably weird for many people, but I really think that Janna is just incredible, I think that she will have a big influence in the next seasons, she's a really strong character and Stephanie plays her outstanding. Joanna is probably the perfect wife for Tyrell, they both match perfectly, a very strong family since both are kinda the same, even if Tyrell did so many wrong and bad things, Joanna knew about them all and still supports him which it show high quality of trust and respect for her husband, from me that is a big thumbs up, also even if she is scared about him, she still manage to shake him a bit and not let him do whatever he wants. About Mr.Robot, well, there's not much to say, he's a really interesting character played by one incredible actor, to be honest, I knew somehow that he was Elliot's father, and probably most of us did, but never expected what actually happened, it made my brain explode for a second, really stunning the entire thing, I just love how the character is played, I don't have any special things about him, because everything special about him, it is connected to Elliot, since they both are kinda same person, but I like how the character is played, really well played.Amazing Season, the next season starts right on my birthday, so I call it a well accepted gift! (I'm not a native English Speaker, so I'm sorry for my grammatical errors)",positive
One of my favorite 😍 wish you all a good day xoxo,positive
"Let me start off by saying this is one of the most interesting and exciting shows I've watched to date. The pilot could have easily been split up into a couple of episodes as so much happened. This keeps the show extremely interesting and the view yearning for the next episode.I also like how the show is tends to be unpredictable. Of course some parts are predictable, the directors do a great job at keeping this minimum. I don't want to add any spoilers so I will keep it brief. So many shows nowadays have mundane scenarios where the outcome is obviously suspected. This show will leave you saying ""wow, no way"" after many of the scenes and episodes. I know the show is still in the first season but so far, it is very promising. I advise all of you to give it a chance and you will be hooked!",positive
Dull Characters. Child like thoughts about how the world works. No good story lines. No chemistry between the characters. I may have liked this in College but I unfortunarely watched after college and with a bit of life experience. I've outgrown this show's appeal.,negative
"Not sure if I can really comment because I only made it halfway through the second season. I found the 1st season solid and compelling, but by the 2nd or 3rd episode of season 2 I was just dragging myself through the motions, hoping for anything really. Acting was great and all but it became almost painfully slow. It seemed like a good portion of each episode was a ton of negative space and a Building or character paired with foreboding synth music just ushering us into the next scene. I may try it again someday but for right now, I'm pretty over it.",negative
"The first episode and the first scene itself is so intriguing. Then it carries on to be an interesting hacking thriller. But after that, the show stops being all of that and starts being something it's not.1. The premise is weak and lame ( where is the revolution )
2. The psychological warfare scenes of Elliot's are boring and annoying. Feels like the show is trying to be something like Legion, but executing it really badly
3. No redeeming characters. Everyone's an a***PS- Tyrell is my fav character.",negative
Couldn't stop watching. I like the current events that's in the film and how this could really happen,positive
"Very good pilot I liked the way story goes and doesn't add any crap in the screen play. Show good hacking tactics of the character and assumes that viewers are human and have mind that can understand. Show features real environment of computer security, Servers, and Hacking environment. Though the show falsely targeted the Indian Ethinicity being edict to Illegal porn & sex edict, this may induce controversy and show may loose some of the viewer in that respect. But I recommend the show should revolve around a good storyline and get far from controversies. Finally a good series about computer hacking. Now I think writers have Upgraded their OS of their mind.",positive
"An absolutely terrible show. Go watch fight club, it'll be the same edgy teenager story except you don't have to waste more than a couple of hours of your time.",negative
"I give this show a 9.4/10, and Shows like The Walking Dead, and True Detectives S01 are similar ratings in my critic book in my mind. I always tell myself I don't have time to write a review, but this show, for being on Cable Television and not a premium network such as HBO, This program should be backed by some more important people. Not saying everyone involved in this show is awesome, but you got Rami Malek, and Christian Slater, This show has you on the edge of your seat because of the fast paced narrating, and the relative feelings and emotions flowing through each character such as the main actor. Taking Morphine, and using Subutex so he doesn't withdrawal. The writers are involved in today's trends, and vices all of us Americans struggle with, including us Internet or should I say Inter web 1337 people. It's not a hacker, matrix, like The Chosen One type of show like a lot of people judging a show by its poster thinks. The main actors can read and relate and seek justice through using his skills of computer networking hacking and coding. he uses languages and his Virtual Private Network to seek out not only making child predators go down, but he wants to take down the BIG E Corporation which reminds me of ENRON in a way. Mix up the Spider-man, Evil Corp that Spider goes up against with a secret society such as Anon, and you got this new age computer hacker genre that keeps you on the edge of your seat if you are familiar with any of today gossip and trends. ANTISOCIAL means F*&& THE GOVERNMENT and I am sure a lot of us feel that way! GO MALEK!",positive
"I, like many other reviewers of this programme, was quite sceptical launching myself into this on Amazon prime after scrolling through recommended TV Shows to watch. Let me start off my calling some of the other reviews wrong.You don't need to be a techie to like this. I am certainly not. All of the hacking stuff that was mentioned I did not understand, however I did not feel as though either this impaired my ability to understand the plot nor inhibit my enjoyment of it. I am also sure that the programmes creators did not intend it to in the first place either.It was really fascinating the role of Elliot develop as the series went on. I liked the way he used the audience to (sort of) explain what was going on in his head and the reasoning for his actions. You start off thinking you understand everything, then by about episode 6 you feel as though you understand nothing. I also think this was intended. Don't be discouraged, as it all makes sense in the end.I loved the breath of fresh air the main character brought. To be honest, I get bored very easily at the predictable, dull, one- dimensional characters that other Hollywood generic films and shows bring out. Instead, we get a view of a socially inept, shy guy, whose development throughout the series is one of the most intriguing bits.I warn you, whatever the ending you conjure up in your mind, it will be way off.In conclusion: Watch it.",positive
"So far the show appears to be a poor rip off of the movie Fight Club. The main character with his schizophrenic personality creates an alter ego, totally imaginary, Mr Robot and then the 2 personalities struggle to destroy the credit companies. Good acting, poor writing with annoying characters - even the imaginary ones. The show seems to get interesting and then in comes an imaginary character that lives only in the mind of Elliot and the chow bogs down and gets boring very quickly. Christian Slater must have been desperate for work to accept this role. I recommend seeing Fight Club so you can see how this clever idea works when it is done well unlike this TV show.",negative
"Just watched the first episode, it was really awesome the main part I love is the acting of the person. it is really great as it shows the technology too the things that are happening. I just love it. The acting of Rami Malek is brilliant his style is awesome. He is now one of my favorite actor. This Serial is based on hacking and this is my own field the field of computer science, it engages all the thing the servers hacking stuff like that, it also shows that how hackers live where and what they do what they are doing is it good or bad fortunately in this serial this is really good.

"After episode 10, I took a 3 month break from giving this show another attempt to finish the season. I finally tried to watch episode 11 last night. I turned it off 15 minutes before the ending. I've never seen anything start out so promising then crash and burn so badly. It seems the writers are writing it as they go. There's no direction. The entire cast seem bored by episode 8 or 9 wondering ""Where is this all going?"" They must be because the acting goes completely downhill by episode 11. I think they just want it all to be over with. It's pretty bad when the most unlikable characters are the protagonists and the most interesting are the sociopath Swedish couple. This show started off like a David Fincher film then careened off into M. Night Shyamalan territory. Huge disappointment!",negative
"What a rollercoaster ride this series was, the ups and the lows really you hard, though the second season is a little slow, once you get past it this series has one of the most intense storyline.",positive
"The show, the actors and their performance, the story line and background music is just amazing. After watching the first episode of season 3, here is where I think story is going. The way Angela said, If everything goes back to normal and nothing ever happened, and the facility where White Rose was talking about Stage 2, I think they are going to make a time machine :D It's just a theory.... It's just a show so anything can happen right?Cheers!",positive
"When I started watching season 1, I was very impressed with the technical approach to the series. It was very well documented and executed and it had a strong sense of realism, which I loved from the beginning.
As the episodes went by, the series grew on all aspects, but the technical part got dialed back slightly, at least from my point of view. This aspect was overshadowed by the complexity, the incredible plot and the stunning performance of the actors. Yes, for me, every single one of them was an absolute monster in their role.
The whole experience of the show was mind-blowing and truly inspiring. It really hit me in the heart. That's why, Mr. Robot has a special place among all the movies and TV shows I've watched.
Thank you friend, it was fun talking to you.",positive
"Mr. Robot takes you for a ride in the world of hacking and connections shrouded in mystery and rebellion. Hacking that actually looks legitimate on screen. We immerse with Mr. Robot into the world of hacktivism. Our main character, Elliot, is diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and it's interesting to watch how he copes and unfolds. Rami Malek and Christian Slater kill it with their performances. Director Niels Arden Oplev and Writer Sam Esmail take you on a journey that's written with intelligence and thrill in mind.I recommend giving this show a view.",positive
"I'm not a jeweler, but i recognize a diamond when i see it .. this is probably the best pilot i've ever seen. Everything about it is topnotch, especially the casting.My only complaint is that they didn't release the whole season at once. I'm likely to get a nervous breakdown until the next part of Mr Robot.I'm also happy to see that a young Swedish actor got his chance to shine in this show. I really think Martin Wallström can contribute to this show and i wish him all the best in the future cause i think he is a talented actor with a lot of charisma. Doesn't he remind you of Cillan Murphy a little? I think we will see some nice interacting between him and the brilliant Rami Malik.",positive
"It is quirky! The story is good, but how it has taken the story around and around, taking it to the end is amazing!But mostly, the music! : The soundtrack is out of this world, for the first time I have turned up the sound to the maximum, specially at the end of Season 1, Episode 6 despite this being not Hans Zimmer!Some acting is a bit overdone and not so impressive but you don't mind when it is alongside some of the brilliant lines uttered by really good actors.It is believable, I get the tech parts, and I love the locations too.",positive
"Did this show just get political? See enough of that crap everywhere else. Why do they feel the need to drag politics into TV shows. Pushing a political agenda during a TV show is a quick way to lose viewer's for no reason. We are done with this show! And why do I need to write five lines to post on IMDb? What if something is simple, and doesn't need this much explaining?",negative
"Im a big fan of this show...right from the pilot episode from S01...dr s was something which hooked me to this..and believe it or not ..i have more expectations from this show compared to GOT / BCS / Suits etc.Best part of the show are only the below, atleast for me,> Cinematography
> Soundtrack
> Non-Linear / Suspenseful / Ambigious storytelling

"I can't wait for this show to start, if it's going to be anything like the first episode, then this thing is going to be my current all time favourites. The story was narrated by Rami really well, giving the audience an inside to his social disorder and his performance on the show encapsulated that. I know some of the audience would be lost with TOR, Gnome, KDE, and Linux and all that, but for someone who does find it fascinating (like me) I really appreciated that the director/producer/or whoever didn't create this fake computer operating system just to jazz up what hacking usually looks like, the command line. The story has enough to build on, his social disorder, his vigilante hacking of bad people without remuneration, his social hacking of his friends (Angela being currently the only one) and colleagues to kind of direct them to better choices in the future. I really like the way it's filmed and the acting especially by Rami is amazing so I can't wait for episode 2,3,4....etc, etc.",positive
"Well. I was really waiting for something like this. Most of the TV series that I watched earlier had few connections with real 'hacking' and stuff, but none of them were solely based on the very idea of it.The director David Fincher has a bunch of great movies in his bag like Gone Girl, The Social Network, Seven, Fight Club, and not to forget The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, where the character of Lisbeth Salander resembles Elliot. There are few places where you could feel a bit dizzy, but the idea behind the story is fine. Elliot, a Sociopath, is able to see and read people but cannot speak his mind, the solution for this problem: Hacking> Hacking those people is his way of connecting with them. Its amazingly intriguing and I would strongly (like very strongly) recommend this one.",positive
"A standout amongst the most eminent sleeper hits in late memory must be USA's Mr. Robot. The developing drumbeat of commendation is totally exceptional and for enthusiasts of value TV, Mr. Robot plainly has something unique.Season one contains such a large number of remnants of splendor it's difficult to try and rundown. A blend of Fight Club, Momento, American Psycho, with a dash of Kubrick. Unmistakably Esmail is a major fan and gets his motivation from these, and numerous other fantastic thrillers, and the tone and pacing of Mr. Robot plainly mirrors this.Since season one is finished, it's unmistakable to everybody that Mr. Robot is one of the best TV programs of the year, if not ever.",positive
"This is a show that even after reading the outstanding reviews , I was still impressed after viewing the Pilot. I was left wanting more, I want to binge watch it, but then I would know it would be all over in 1 day for me. This has huge potential, it kind of reminds me a little of the Matrix, good quality nerd speak (do not dumb this part down USA Network, I get so frustrated when movies are just ruined by poor terminology or believability) It has Dexter elements too, I love the talking to himself, paranoia. It works so well in this pilot. (and doesn't get old or feel stolen from dexter either which i think is a great achievement). The writing is outstanding, like Really really good. The directing is outstanding. The producing is outstanding. The cinematography is good, this is the TV show i've been waiting for since Dexter finished or Sons of Anarchy or Breaking Bad, and the Movie I've been waiting for since the original matrix. It will grow a cult following, but it will grow bigger, because such a high percentage of young people under 40 especially will eat this right up. It needs to be left nerdy, it needs to have more money thrown into it, to make sure the writing is complex, and then it will truly succeed IMHO. If the reviews stay at 9.4-9.5 it will end up being one of the biggest shows of all time. And it will earn royalties over the next 10-15 years more than anyone can imagine. Because its so good it will get streamed billions of times.",positive
"Fans of the long-lived Dexter series will immediately feel something familiar in Mr. Robot. The similarities are many, the main characters are detached anti-social oddities, strangely unable to emotionally connect with those around them. They are techies by day and vigilantes by night. They basically want to be good people even though they do things that are illegal or socially unacceptable. Dexter was cursed with needing to kill. Elliot is cursed with the meaningless of a world seemingly controlled by others.Dexter uses his official access to databases to zoom in on a target and then surveils them live. Elliot uses his hacking skills to do likewise. Both choose a punishment that fits the crime of their targets. They each seek to expunge injustices. Neither wants any extensive involvement with their targets, just instant and irrevocable justice.The routine soliloquy of questioning reality and what is being experienced is almost identical for each of them. Elliot is more playful in that his hallucination is addressed directly to the audience. There are also similarities in directorial technique. The way that pop music ducks under dialogue and then overlays it. The way that conversations happen and then, when you can't believe he actually said that, it is revealed as a virtual dream sequence. Audiences will be rooting for the awkward Elliot, just as Dexter fans wanted him to prevail. It is an excellent show with a pilot that will hook you.",positive
"I went to this movie with my family. The plot is really interesting!! The actors are doing their job perfectly. I will recommend this movie to my friends, because this is a really good level of the movie!",positive
I'm not into computers or hacking but thankfully this show is so much more. And I just love Rami in this. His character Elliot is a bit messed up and he plays him so well. And the plot twists just keep coming and coming. After the second episode I was hooked! The second season seems to be better than the first.,positive
"But I think way more people around Elliot Alderson should die in a tragic way, and he should be way more paranoid... he should feel chased most of the time, because he's a hacker and one of the best he should be marked as wanted and have a more runaway life. It also feels weird that he works for Evil Corp but his only plan should be to destroy their wealth for what they did to his Father, also because he's paranoid he should work more with his sister at the end it seems that's the only thing he really cares about. I really like the split personality between his father and that they work together now, also that Elliot talks and interacts with us, it gives a unique touch to the series which is a rarity. It reminds me of Dexter :)Normally I would rate this series somewhere between 8*-9* from 10*. Mainly because some part seems off in the series but it's still a good one. And because it's still ongoing and the 4th Season of this series is still coming I'd give it a 10*...",positive
"Film is very wonderful, as long as has become the electronic crimes Talk time during the past years, this is what makes me watching this film and being an interesting film and a particularly in the US television niche, followed all the episodes only Parts I or II, where I admire the personalities of the film or of the better, smooth these circumstances which led me to write an article about particularly set in my own site, you can watch them here: www.alamtech2016.com Sam Esmail began writing Mr. Robot as a feature film but it turned into a television series when the project became too long.

"It went political and flushed itself down the toilet. It was a great show, I really enjoyed season 1 and 2. First episode o season 3 really ruined the show for me. All the bull**** references to Trump and how the worlds gone to **** really shows how miserable liberals the writers are. Sore losers made this great show crappy and not at all edgy as they hoped.",negative
"Thank you for not trying to impress me with dramatic camera shaking and 1 second chop shots for 30 seconds. Good use of a classic song with the right amount of playtime. THat did better at setting up the drama than the visual manipulation I just mentioned. I see I need 10 lines of text for a review. I don't understand why I need to be more complex. Simple is CLEARER. I would love to see less drug, homosexual and nude scenes since media makes normalizing these activities as socially OK, fsociety. Keep your alternative sex style private. Safer for YOU. Good show so far. I've only seen the 1st but it motivates me to see another. Thanks again for not messing with the screenplay.",positive
"Mr. Robot is influenced by many TV shows and movies, including 'The Matrix', 'Fight Club' and many more... Even though it is influenced by lots of other movies and shows, it has made these influences something new and special, like we've never seen before. Season one is just great, from the first episode we can learn the show is unique and special. Elliot is a justice warrior, cyber security worker by day, and a vigilante by night, using his hacking skills to catch the bad guys. But it's more than that. Elliot needs to confront his own issues. And as the show moves on we learn that Elliot is not the hero we think, he's a guy with a good will that wants to ""save the world"", but has deep issues. The show has a couple of mind-blowing twists, and it is really great. Even though I think season two focuses more on the revolution that Elliot has begun and less on his mind (even though it does), I think the second season is great. Great show, recommend it!",positive
"Leave it to American TV producers to produce evil and stupid crap. The first two episodes were worth watching but the frequent cigarette product placement made the show suspect and the violence in episode 2 set the tone for descent into rubbish in episode 3.The technical aspects of the computers and hacking were substantially better than most TV shows but somewhat lacking in realism. The show started off with some likable and sympathetic characters, but the production quality and acting are marginal by many of the actors. Rami Malek does a good job as Elliot but shows inconsistent directing. Portia Doubleday could do better in the role of Angela.",negative
"While waiting to get my restless hands on the most recent Halt and Catch Fire, I made the terrible mistake of watching the pilot episode of Mr. Robot. During the first five minutes it had subtle tones of Rubicon, which is about the highest praise I can bestow upon a TV show. (By the way, if you're able to find the 12th episode of Rubicon, I will, without hesitation, pay you for it.) Unfortunately the similarities between Rubicon and Mr. Robot ends with the ascetics and a few shared characteristics of the protagonists.Mr. Robot doesn't bother to hide anything, least of all the low opinion it holds of its audience's intelligence. It bathes in every sin it purports to detest. ""Hello, friend."" The attempted manipulation of the audience begins in the first fraction of a second. I would have had more respect for the show if they just would have had the socially awkward protagonist rescue a kitten from a tree in the opening shot to let us know, ""Yes, he is socially awkward, but he does the right thing, so love him, as we've instructed you to do.""He does take down a giant child pornography ring in the first few moments of the show though. And, just in case you're a heartless bastard and aren't yet convinced that he is indeed the good guy, he does ""save"" a puppy near the end of the pilot. I wish I were kidding. By the end of the episode, I'm pretty sure the show is bordering on satire and just doesn't know it. Or would it be a parody? I can never tell.But instead of a kitty rescue we get a curiously self-aware hyper- angsty narrator lifelessly muttering the words ""Hello, friend."" Aaah, he wants to be our friend! (This opening could be redeeming if it turns out the narrator has been consciously deceiving the audience since the beginning, but that seems woefully unlikely. (Any deception that is taking place seems to be going on unbeknownst to our hero.)) I had never realized how very redundant it is to have a narrator address the audience for the sake of breaking the fourth wall. Now I will never be able to feel any way other than that.That wasn't what shook me out of the show though. No, that came around the 12 minute mark when suddenly the show took a terribly predictable turn. Shoehorned into the show, the valiant protagonist, who, lest we forget, brought down a child pornographer and is our friend, goes on an anti-commercialism diatribe. This sort of thing isn't new at all and it rarely causes me to audibly scoff or squint my eyes in incredulity, but this moment was a hefty lurch that the show seemed to believe in mightily, and it was far from over.Five minutes later, the protagonist shifts from bemoaning the awful commercial nature of modern society to explicitly identifying the source of his obsession; a giant, evil corporation simply titled E Corp. Nearly omnipotent, it seems, and made of pure evil. I'm sure the unending voice-over would have loved to give us more details about all the many ways E Corp is evil, but he was regrettably interrupted by a commercial break.And that is the big joke, and it's a pretty good one too, in my opinion. You see, Mr. Robot is produced by USA Network. I can't blame you if you aren't familiar with USA. It was one of those networks that ran Law & Order reruns 24/7 until its syndication pricing structure changed about five years ago. Anyhow, USA Network is one of the ponies in NBCUniversal's cable stable. And NBCUniversal is a subsidiary of Comcast.That's right, Mr. Robot is a show about a guy who has a keen loathing for a giant corporation, produced by the single most loathed corporation in America. (Many surveys regarding these sorts of things take place each year and it is considered a win for Comcast if they don't come away with the title of ""Most Hated Corporation."") The show is possible in many ways because Comcast exists. Is this a case of self-reflection on Comcast's part? Are they seeking to fringe-ify their detractors? It seems unlikely. What they are doing, simply enough, is trying to capitalize on their unpopularity. It is a strange hall of mirrors where what people hate is projecting themselves hating that thing back at them. Thank goodness it's a simple feat to hate the mirror without hating the subject.This isn't at all to say that everything made or done by Comcast should be subject to disdain, but when, by many measures, the most loathed corporation produces a show using a loathed corporation as the antagonist, I believe a certain degree of scrutiny is justified. It is akin to Donald Trump producing a show about a wholesome country-boy running for president against a blowhard, cartoonishly- haired buffoon, and making money in the process. (Speaking of Trump, his actual TV show was under Comcast's umbrella, and I'm guessing this fictitious one would find a home there as well.)For as absurd as it was, the most unbearable part of watching the pilot episode were the moments the show wasn't actually on. Sitting through commercial breaks to get to the end made the whole expedition truly laughable. ""Our TV show about a guy railing against commercialism, evil corporations, and an over-medicated society will be back right after this four-minute commercial break starting with an ad for Xanax followed by an ad for Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Stay tuned!""",negative

"Thats right, tell it like it is style, straight to the point, this series doesn't waste any time in progressing and telling it like it is, great production too, great acting, great plot, in a world where everyone is hacking the s*** out of everyone, its only a matter of time before serious c.warfare kicks in that will effect everyone on a day to day basis - notice they delayed the last episode by a week due to the on air shooting, but did you also notice in that same week there was a massive collapse in the Chinese stock market which in turn affected western markets, this was also comparable to that last episode in which the hack on financial institutions was initiated - interesting stuff! Cant wait for season2, hopefully it will be allowed on air, was quite surprised this one was, some useful bits of info in there if you clock it...BIG RESPECT to the whole production crew on this one, keep up the good works 10STAR",positive
"Well I've just seen one episode of this TV-Show. This show takes us into a controversial world of real problems rather than further away from reality like almost every other thing showing on TV.

I hope every episode will be as good or better as the first one. thanks and peace out // Freedom fighter/keyboard warrior. Revolution is coming! ha ha :) I want more TV shows with this concept. this is illustrating the real issues with the world, such as greed, making profits.

Season 4... perfectly written played every episode of season 4 is so good,positive
"The pilot for Mr. Robot was, quite frankly, excellent. It promised a story and a character with hidden depth, two things so often missing from series nowadays.While the rest of the season didn't quite live up to that pilot, they did manage to build up the supporting cast quite well - even if the minor characters were incredibly 1 dimensional. The fact the lead character somewhat fails to develop is explained well, even if that does mean the middle episodes were a bit lacking.Episodes 8 and 9 then picked back up, offering more depth of character and the promise of action. Before the final episode came along, and the dollar signs appeared.It's quite ironic - and the last time I make this mistake with a US show - that a series about anti-capitalism should make a pointless second season just to make more money.Frankly, this would have got an 8 or 9 from me if it had finished. But it didn't. They chased the dollar and decided to make a second season. Which completely ruined the first. All the build up to some kind of conclusion just disintegrated completely in a pointless prologue for a new season...Probably the last time I trust a US show with a great story concept. They just don't do it. Have the balls to finish after 1 season, ffs.",negative

"I am half way through the first series of the show now, and I simply don't get where those writing the one star reviews are coming from.Yes, there are some minor inaccuracies in the technical aspects of the show, but they are nowhere near as egregious as some on here are making out. There is a correct emphasis on using social engineering to achieve goals, rather than the usual Hollywood crap of pushing the (art director generated) magic button to produce the magical outcome. This show actually attempts to show the usage of computers and the use of the cli as it actually IS, rather than as some fantasy generated by Hollywood scriptwriters.I work in IT. I use Unix as my desktop and server OS. So, it will come as no surprise that they had me when the central character used chmod -x to change permissions on a rootkit.Also, a lot of people on here seem to have trouble with the concept of the unreliable narrator. This is a fairly standard trope, I would have thought, and would seem to indicate a lack of sophistication in the reviewer rather than a fault in the show.To sum up - an excellent series about IT which actually requires a certain level of intelligence and attention from its viewers.",positive

I have so much to say about the show, yet I can't put into words how truly amazing the show was. Just give it few years and then people will begin to understand just how good the show is, and then it will get the fanbase it deserves.
The last season alone was worth 10 stars.
What a show.

"Thanks for the Truth a lot of people feel but are scared to tell. Many are going to say it's just a show, but please take more from it than just a show.

Open Minded people will know what I'm saying.Please watch these shows and read more in to life then want you have been trained to use more of your brain and your feelings of truth when watching.

"One of the most groundbreaking and unique series of all time! All of the characters have immense depth and the plot line is the most unique of any TV show in decades! Rami Malek is brilliant as ""Elliott,"" and Portia Doubleday as ""Angela"" is intense. Grace Gummar as the FBI agent investigating the Five/Nine-FSociety event is sheer perfection. And, BD Wong as Whiterose is one of the most honest and remarkable portrayals of a transgender character I've seen thus far. Honestly, all of the characters are intriguing. Casting director deserves a huge nod!!! I must admit I'm completely bored with Joanna's character...so, PLEASE bring Tyrell's character back...he was the most interesting by far!!! Can't wait to see what happens next season! I have high hopes that this series lasts a while...so completely relevant to modern day technology and its potentially devastating effects. Mad, twisted, brilliant and addictive!!!",positive
"I wasn't expecting much, so the surprise of liking it so much was very exciting. I began to see a possible future without the Corporation. Corporations, legal entities without heart and soul, that turn the labors of underpaid minions into huge profits, distributed to a few already rich shareholders. And when the profits are not satisfying enough? Well, then they out source. Leaving Americans without work and dangling in a society that doesn't have enough jobs but has this insane idea that it is ones own fault if they are unemployed. Corporations should be paying the cost of supporting unemployed men and women they threw to the wolves - penalized and taxed for hurting the economy in favor of their bottom line.Or someday we could see a revolution, a bloodless one, where the people just undo the ability of Corporations to act with impunity as they suck up natural and human resources and give nothing back. Well that is the promise of this very interesting and entertaining new series. I can't wait for episode 2.",positive
"The steady, slow decline of a great series seems to be repeating in television as of late. The first season hits hard developing rich characters in an enthralling plot.The second season doesn't live up to its predecessor, but invites you in knowing you are willing to wait for even just a taste of what you had before.The third season becomes blatantly shameful, pushing boundaries and allowing for disappointment by creating vapid drama and baseless shock-value scenes.Subsequent seasons repeat the shallowness that swallows up any resemblance of what was, and instead of resisting temptation, creators pad their wallets with cheap, script degrading inserts that we viewers are expected to accept as the status quo.Forgive me for being abstract, you see, I am low on energy, having not reminded my AI assistant to put sour candy and red soda on my shopping list.",positive
"I noticed this gem just through from the thumbnail and gave it a shot. Me and a friend of mine watched this and were simply intoxicated with how accurate and raw the show was depicting this subject matter. The entire time we were hooked on what would come next, not just from the story but from the characters as well. The serious, dark, and sometimes comedic atmosphere was everything that I could have hoped for. If a show can keep me this engaged and push me to actually think past just what is being shown, i'm all for it. The last time something of this caliber came along was too long ago. I really hope this gets picked up. I want to see what happens next. Please make this a reality.",positive

"This is one of the most brilliant shows that I have ever had the privilege of experiencing. I watched the show weekly, anxious for every next episode, often times watching the prior week's episode before every new episode and rewatching seasons before new seasons arrived. In my experience, after you already know what happens, it's almost more enjoyable to rewatch and catch all the clues that were right in front of you the entire time like Darlene's erratic demeanor in season 1 and everything regarding Elliot's surroundings in season 2 prior to both seasons' revelations. Everything is beautifully scripted. Acting and direction are on point. Very unique camera work. Very interesting characters.That being said, if I act as if anything from season 4 plays into the equation, much like the star wars plot for episode 8 and probably episode 9, this changes my entire review for the series and becomes a 6 star rating because season 4 so far is one of the most contradictory loads of crap that the producers are force-feeding us yearning fans. Season 4 essentially contradicts the basic theme of the entire show of how blind and controlled society has let itself become in that they believe us fans to be so blind and naive that we have to ignore the entire structure of the brilliant design of seasons 1-3 to be able to keep down the excrement being fed to us. Even the acting from every character finds a way to make me re-experience what I had been snacking on earlier.Nothing adds up!I'll use the example from my favorite character in the show, the 1% of the 1%, Philip Price, arguably one of two of the most powerful men in the world as we see thru his entrenched stance and power over the US Government. Here the best example I can offer why seasons 1-3 are brilliant and why season 4 should be watched with caution. At one point Phillip admits he was put in his powerful position by White Rose however as a mercenary out for his own agenda, not a pawn like every other of White Rose's cohorts. In fact, he puffs his chest higher when he explains White Rose has interests to lose because as a mercenary he'll blow up the world and not give a dam. We also see that he's skillful at hiding that he actually wouldn't blow up the world because he has quite the mysterious infatuation for Angela. Angela, who to her own birthright is so powerful, she was ultimately the reason why Phillip met his downfall. The revelation of season 3 that Angela is Phillip's daughter isn't at all cheesy. It isn't cliche. It fits the entire equation. From early seasons Phillip took an interest in Angela that we the viewer passed off as somewhat of a perverted nature, quickly promoting Angela thru ECorp, trying to get her to spend some time with him outside of work for his birthday, and mentoring her for no apparent reason. An age old adage says that it's lonely at the top. To gain that kind of power Phillip has been forced into a life of pursuing his own agenda and using people for what they are worth to him. This has left him empty and yearning for that piece of his youthful innocence that led to an unintended relationship generating an even more unplanned blood-tie in Angela, of whom he continued to keep tabs on thru his rise to power. It even slides into the reason why a conglomerate like ECorp stupidly went with a third party tech company, AllSafe, blindly opening the door for the Dark Army and hacker extraordinaire with a vendetta, Elliot, to connect and set forth the chain of events that White Rose needed to leverage the UN vote. The revelation of season 3 is that Angela is in fact Phillip's daughter, his weak spot, his one attachment to this world.The first scene of Season 4 starts with Phillip letting the dark army shoot Angela in the head and then later spewing his devotion to White Rose of how ""loyal"" he's been to her/him. Barf. Just one of the Season 4 deconstruction moments of a masterpiece.Unless season 4 culminates in exposing its own contradiction, this show was a 3 season masterpiece that can end as a story of how our lives are controlled by the often times petty agendas of powerful people and the affects it has on our psyche.Watch further with caution.",positive

"Malek's Elliot is a Cyber security specialist by day, laboring away for a cubicle-filled corporation. By night, though, he's an unrepentant hacker — delving into the personal lives of those who enter his orbit — as well as a drug user and someone so painfully awkward that he freely admits, ""I don't know how to talk to people.""He is lonely,he is sad but that's not all.Diving into the plot, Elliot is introduced on the subway, his frantic narration imparting that he has stumbled onto ""a conspiracy bigger than all of us,"" involving masters of the universe who will essentially stop at nothing to achieve their objectives(referring to E-corp also). If that sounds more than a little paranoid — and much of ""Mr. Robot"" does — Elliot is assured this is all too real by a renegade hacker (Christian Slater, marking TV's best use of him in some time), who goes by the name Mr. Robot, and wants to recruit him to infiltrate and undermine the shadowy corporation(E-corp) Elliot has been hired to protect.At last i must say this has been a magnificent production by USA Network and has raised much eyebrows with tremendous drama, suspense and some unexpected climax.",positive

"In the beginning, it was glorious, a cool great introvert character that uses his intelligence to change the world, then came the dual personality thing, which is not a bad thing, but it IS a deviation that wasn't for the better.Towards the end, it was like the writers are trying to prove a vague point to a maniac, so while kept the visual amazing stunts, they seemed to enforce the idea of having to call a perfectly genetically male person a ""her"" by every character constantly. Now whether you're with it or against it, it is not the way to emphasis on its importance to you (to ruin the show and confuse the audience).",negative
"This is by far one of the best pilots I have seen in ages!! Being in IT myself it was a breath of fresh air to see that they keep with the real techniques/lingo used by real professionals, and not sensationalized crap that is used in other show like CSI. I hope that the director and the writers stick with this throughout the life of the show. The first episode had be hanging on the edge of my seat for the full 60 minutes. I love this show already and I hope to see 100 more seasons! Rami Malek does a fantastic job in his role, full props to him! I wish this show every success that it deserves!I cannot wait for episode 2 to come out next week, 1 July!!",positive
"I finally watched the finale. I ditched cable so I had to get creative to get my hands on the last season. If this show had aired on HBO everyone would be talking about it. It is so well crafted, cast and scripted. There are so many mind blowing revaluations it constantly keeps you guessing at what's really going on. The entire series you think things are one way and then the finale reveals that everything you thought was true gets turned upside down. You never see it coming. In the end the series turned out to be about something that, when you look back at it as a whole maybe you should've seen, but you're so invested in the story it's really hard to see. I can't get it out of my head. It's a golden age for television, people are getting really creative.",positive
I really love it! Can't wait for the season 4! every role in this series are well played very good actor and actresses! they actually pick the right actors for this film! everything is so perfect! the story is unpredictable that makes me still interested to watch the next episodes! love it!,positive
"This series is really promising... Pilot episode is outstanding... A nerd, whose mastery in network hacking is really going to make magic... Maybe this was the first pilot to have such dramatic events... Technical explanation given in the pilot was so accurate, most series will give fake technical information and almost always have impossible circumstances, but in this show we can except valid technical information; which is proved by mentioning some valid facts about ""TOR networking"" and ""Onion routing protocol"". I think anonymous person with alias ""Mr robot""(It was written in his shirt) maybe kingpin to this whole series. Let's hope it stays the same....",positive
"If u are a coder, a computer programmer, etc u are in luck cause this tv show shows hacking very much near to reality. Every step that they take in hacking can also happen in the real world (confirmed by Carly chaikin aka Darlene). I will also highly recommend this to introverts. There are people out there who do all sorts of drugs even when they are such an amazing prodigy. Also it gives many philosophies. I am a 13 yr old. If it can appeal to an age gap of 13- 40 yr old, so ofc it can to u. U would be skeptical at first, but it's gonna be gr8.",positive
"It is the first time I write a review in my whole life and thanks to Elliot Alderson I will do it.I loved every scene in this series and I had seen it three times until now and I will see it again and again.It is the type of the series which you see yourself in it, it is not just about hacking, it is about us, about the human beings and their striving for freedom, love and control, about loneliness and how we can face it, and how we make it more powerful and instill it more and more while we are trying to defeat it, about control and how we can regain it and struggle for it.all the characters are complicated, suffering, trying to get in touch with themselves, they are all out of control and in a continuous search for it, they are all human beings even the most wicked of them.",positive
"The whole plot seems to be inspired by delusional character of Edward Norton in fight club. From the very beginning i was sure that Mr. Robot is only an imagination of Elliot as Mr. Robot was getting in & out of every facility Elliot was present,without being noticed. As because the stakes for their mission was high,there weren't supposed to meet in public places or work place because there was already a surveillance of Evil Corp. behind Elliot's back. The whole show has now lost its charm after it was confirmed that Elliot is Mr. Robot.Now we have left with the main character of Elliot which is Intelligent but delusional & Tyler who may help Elliot to harm Evil Corp. for his personal vendetta only.",positive
"This show has everything : amazing characters, top-notch cinematography, music. The main character is actually relatable and a good depiction of an actual anti-social person.",positive
"Having watched 2 and a fraction episodes, I'm starting to like this ""against my will"".""Against my will"" because the gray-hat hacker Elliot reminds me of every arrogant/annoying kid I worked with in my software engineering career. Plus, it took me a while to appreciate that Elliot was going to be rendered with a lot of nuances instead of a simple ""glorious fighter against evil"".There are a lot of things that bring back the security stuff that I learned toward the end of my career when I was reading people like Bruce Schneier. I particularly ""appreciate"" things that ring true such as his snark against older people (and for example their choice of weak passwords).. they sting, but for many people they're accurate.Finally, I can't think of any performance that Gloria Reuben has done that I disliked; this piece is no exception.",positive
"Both visually and argumentatively, it's just great, always entertaining, interesting and very intelligent",positive
"Damn 👍mr.robot includes one of the most powerful and full of meaning scripts in the history of tv serieses,and choosing rami malek and the whole cast was awesome for this series.
A combination of powerful drama in a different world ...👍🤞",positive
"I hadn't seen such a great series in years.
that really blew my mind.
I miss hearing this dialogue
hello friend...",positive
This show has exponentially blown my mind away. It depicts how a human brain can have its proxies and act differently at different situations. The self talk between Elliot and his proxies is far too magnificent. This is my best seen season in 2020. Finally something good i have witnessed. It plays with my mind about what we want to become and what our realities our. The last season has given me a new direction to look at life.,positive
"The show started out with so much potential but slowly and steadily degenerated into more of the same sick and violent programming that we see everywhere else. Talk about taking a concept and trashing it for all it worth. Its overwhelmed with drugs and violence to the point of being the ultimate ""bad trip"" film series. This time with a psycho hacker backdrop. The cerebral aspects of the show could have been developed with modern day events providing a template such as those involving Edward Snowden and Kim Dotcom or those involved with the development of the crypto currency Bitcoin. As the show stands it should be renamed ""the revenge of the drugged Apocalypse zombie hackers.""",negative
"The show is your basic leftist show. ""Steal from the rich and give to the poor"" In this case it's a hacker, Elliot Alderson, whose job is to hack big companies network base and steal their money.",positive
Just get started and you will feel it. One of the best thrilling tv series,positive
"It thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Robot, it might be one of the best series i have watched since True Detective. the visuals is appealing and smooth, which give the series a nice look and as a result of this, gives it a modern look. It's a welcomed break in the whole reboots, spin-offs and ongoing downwards spiral, that have come to original content in the television industry. This is for me, an unprecedented plot, with clear connections to its makers intension and previous works. If you want something, that is not bound by the TV-standard of plot, character arcs, and the copy-paste mentality of modern, big-budget TV-series; this is for you.In the pilot you are completely asking yourself, what is real, how can i trust what i see. You become a part of the series, in a way, that you feel like a active part supporting Elliot on his journey. Not his journey to take down the big company, (which as i see it, may be a supporting plot line, but his journey to figure out what is real. I can't stress it enough, this might be the most original idea of 2015.",positive
"About 11 years ago, there was a new sense of urgency brought into my life by watching Lost for the first time. I was no longer merely entertained for the last hour; I would from then on be waiting on baited breath for 7 days until the next episode to find out what happened to these characters, who in time I increasingly felt so connected to. When Lost ended, that thirst didn't end, and created a void which couldn't be filled, since there would be no more episodes. I understood the story had ended; it was told (whether or not one's opinion was that was appropriately explained or not is irrelevant) and I knew as much about the characters' story as I was going to know). The only way to fill that void was with something else, and so I did, with Breaking Bad. It was different...I was still compelled to know these characters story; still felt a connection with them, though they were so unlike me. It still did what Lost had done; made me look at the connections of those characters and how it related to my world. It made me question my own actions or how I looked at my problems. It made me think. When Breaking Bad ended in spectacular fashion, it left a hole. I tried to fill that hole with many series...ones I truly liked even, but none could fill that place. Mr. Robot immediately filled that void, while also being so different than anything that compelled me before.Hacker story lines have been attempted before, usually to the tune of complete disaster. ""Blackhat"" did this most recently, and most horribly. Even just the premise of hammer- wielding God Chris Hemsworth as a hacker turned action hero is ludicrous. The movie itself was even worse. 20 years ago, ""Hackers"" failed miserably (though in a hilariously entertaining way, thus thrusting the movie into cult status) to give us a credible look into the world of technology. Mr. Robot successfully does this, and that's not even the most compelling reason to watch it.The main character is wonderfully written and even more brilliantly portrayed by Rami Malek. He's morbidly introverted and neurotically paranoid, but his sense of justice and ability to be a blind guardian taps into your inner-Batman right at its veins. You want this character to succeed; not just at the tasks at hand, but conquering the inner struggles he has. You want to grow with him.I will also say this is brilliantly written and directed. If you told me this was a David Fincher project I wouldn't even had fact-checked it to find out that was wrong. It's insanely ambitious to cover all of the things it does in one episode, but in doing so sets up the plot perfectly at once instead of taking 3 or 4 episodes to get you hooked the way House of Cards or even The Sopranos did. I am all in right away. The plot is tucked and ready to go, and I believe in this character and his goals. Show me what you've got, Mr. Robot. I'm strapped in and ready for the journey.",positive
"Well, was not expecting it to make me a fan with just the first episode but yes it did. It's not just about the hacking and computer programming, it's much more than that. You see Frankie Shaw, she seems a dealer at first and then you see her life inside as the story moves along she has dreams and she wants a home and life like normal people. She seems very cute with the role she is playing in and yes you'll fall in love with her with the dreams she has. The story turns in every episode in an amazing way. The way main character narrates everything, it sinks you more in the story and yes all characters put the effort to make you fall in love with them! It reflects the social circus going on around us. The social circus of the way of the world. As I'm a computer student sitting out there, to all computer students Elliot will put a coding passion in you. excellent rated from me!",positive
"Cant wait for season 4, 5, 6 7... and more!
i really want the twist of the story and how the mind games are being played by the lead stars.",positive
"Finished Mr. RobotHats off to Sam Esmail for creating this masterpiece 🙌🏻
One of the best TV Show I have ever seenAmazing performance from Rami Malek, This is by far the best acting I've ever seen in a TV Series
Direction, Plot, Every single characters, Writing, Genius story telling, Cinematography, Editing everything is top notch 👌🏻
They gave the show a perfect, well deserved and satisfying endingI've never seen a TV Series/movie where the hacking scenes were so Accurate.
They Perfectly portrayed everything.I'm going to say this again This is nothing short of a masterpiece ❤
Highly recommended 🙌🏻",positive
"Alright ive been hooked on this series finally after giving it a shot.
the only thing throwing me off in intense scenes is when actress Stephanie Corneliussen is on screen, im a fellow Danish person and wow.. when she opens her mouth it sound like ntg was given about acting, only about delivering the line as fast and low as possible, i know there is english subtitles when they start speaking different language than english but my god... atleast speak up and try to put some emotion in those lines.
Terrible misscast but the absolute glory of this show overshines the little black spot on this enormous art piece",positive
"This review of Mr. Robot is best understood in the context of my thoughts on the upcoming Whitey Bulger movie, although they apply equally to Nightcrawler.""Our society idolizes psychopaths. The onslaught of programs that feature and pretend to condemn them are actually training manuals for the burgeoning psychopathic administrative class.""That obviously applies to Tyrell, but also Elliot. The telltale quote below is from Mr. Robot writer Sam Esmail.""These are young people who are tech-savvy, who use technology to their advantage to channel the anger against the status quo and try and make a change to better their lives. It's set in the world of technology, because I think that is a tool that young people can use to bring about change.""And who could argue against that vaguest of ideals, ""change""?? Technology decreases freedom, increases pollution and state control. Slaves to mine the minerals, assemble the components, having already been dispossessed of their ancestral lands, these people are deliberately dumbed down through education and malnutrition, controlled economically and culturally to serve as workers. The slaves, and the money and guns to control and direct their energies, are all prerequisites of an Elliot.And he is completely controlled , a drug dependent, Aspergian transhuman techno-whiz who could no more survive in nature than a computer virus. Simply pull the plug, remove his Matrix link, and Elliot ceases to exist. Sadly (for all of us I suppose), the soul-crushing system Elliot protests is the thing he cannot survive without, because free people would not choose to spend their lives producing the instantly- disposable machines that he centers his life around, and vainly seeks to free them with. In reality Elliot is just another helping of social engineering: make whatever ""change"" you want the youth to adopt seem dangerously rebellious, put it on TV and you've molded a generation. Just as vigilante Bruce Willis in Die Hard is the Military Industrial Complex, Elliot is the Surveillance State, neurotically watching your every move in the name of saving the world. Wiping debt would not save the world, and everyone would be back in debt in no time anyway. It's not truly money but WMDs that equal power in this world, thus it is technology and the Elliots who create it that ultimately enslave, not free us as the show's writer purports. It doesn't matter what radical causes Elliot supports. Form is function, the words don't matter as long as you become as he is. And you will become as he is, or be a lowly, mistreated servant to the psychopathic technocrats, selling them shoes or wiping their tables as the show points out repeatedly. Elliot, far at the top of the mountain, feels free while his every thought is recorded on tape, but understand this: his creation is the purpose of all of it, including this show.",positive
I was really enjoyed the pilot but then it crashed and burned. I know folks with Asperger / Autism that are brilliant programmers because of their ability to focus on details that many of us find boring. So when my wife and i saw the pilot we thought Elliot was very much like someone we have both worked with in the tech world. But then the 2nd and 3rd episodes started developing the characters showing their flaws BUT not just little flaws but dam these folks are all nuts / messed.Oh and Chinese hackers ride around in limos wearing stupid masks? Give me a break this is how you get caught.Oh how the heck does a guy in a jail cell know when Elliot walks in the door of his apartment so he can call? The plot now has so many holes in it that it resembles poorly written code.I could go on but we just finished episode 5 in season one and have decided to move on based on reviews from others that it just stays on the same path and does not get any better.,negative
"Good show, too depressing. It's one thing to know that humanity sucks, it's another thing entirely to wallow in it. Or to wallow in the fantasy of ""burning it all down""
The show continually encourages one to concentrate on everything negative about existence. Nah.",negative
"Actually this show really surprised me in a good way. I enjoy the mix of emotions then the use of plot around them.I think it was done very well and loved how they portrayed the computers in this episode. I often get tired of shows that insist on showing the inside of a computer etc; for me it just not needed.This show takes you on a ride; literally. A beautifully well written show that made me want to watch what happens next time. I have watched a ton of TV shows and I am looking forward to seeing more of this series.This looks at hacking from a very different perspective. So be warned; if you are used to Hollywood's insistence on showing the inside of a computer; you will only get the inside the mind. Of which, I applaud the director's approach.",positive
"Every episode has me sitting on the tip of my seat. At the end of each episode, I have to take a Xanax just to calm my nerves. From the start of episode 1 it got my attention and it never left. I must say I'm not a big fan of drug related subjects, but it's not like I'm watching 'Trainspotting'. I do think it's fair to give you a warning. I've overheard somebody say ""all the hacks in the show are realistic"". So if you're interested in hacking but never tried anything, you'll be tempted to. Now that I think of of it, it doesn't include the warning 'Do not try at home'. This is by far the most exciting show I've seen! I can only pray season 2 will be here SOON. I can recommend this show to everybody",positive
Series are showing us that we didn't notice how the system is setup.Its very deep to think watch and learn a different think of style.This World's system is very complicated stratified.There is also need for the poor to be rich guy.Humanity is vanishing and all matters is Money but this series is showing us its just the system's trick that we captured on it.Characters are also very different and have a cool of style of it.You will be wraped in it.And most important of all if you cant guess whats the next scene in the next episode thats means the series caught success.Finally I can comfortly say that you will not regret your time to spend on it.,positive
"It would be incredibly hyperbolic to call this show one of the best shows on TV with just one episode under its belt, but it could be that great. It beautifully uses the voice-over device (a device oftentimes referred to as a ""cheap trick"" in Hollywood) to display the protagonist's philosophical ""hacktivist"" views. Rami Malek is perfect as he nails Elliot's anti-social tendencies as if he were a loner himself. Elliot's characterization is so well-handled that it could carry the show alone, but it throws in many existential and political questions that almost make you wonder if the world Elliot lives in is the same one we live in (it most likely is but still). If people can appreciate the thematically centered plot, this is going to be a huge hit and could give the USA network its first real big shot at some major critical acclaim.",positive
"Well I have to admit that I had a trouble to see that series at the beginning, mostly because I didn't understand nothing at all since the finale of the 2nd season. But, actually when you finally understand you become addicted to it because expresses the feelings about capitalism, LGBTQ community, drugs addicts and people with mental diseases. And what it makes it so awesome is so accurate is to describe and depicts these feelings at screen.
Marvelous job from the whole cast and Sam Esmail with his colleagues!
I definitely recommend it!!!!",positive
"This is the show I have been waiting for. Currently there are few competitors for quality, substance and relevancy. There are a number of great dramas to be sure, but few live up to what Mr.Robot imbues. It is written by people that are aware of the grand issues in our time. It is a rare gift to create Television that is gripping, realistic and informative. It gives me wonder how long this fantastic biopic will last due to its ability to fly over its target without fear of disregarding political correctness or retribution from the establishment it is demonizing. Many topics of this nature end up watered down and made topical, so far Mr. Robot does not pull any punches combating subjects such as corporate fascism, privacy issues, cyber-terrorism, depression, substance abuse, modern slavery, nihilism et al. 10 thumbs up for Mr. Robot.",positive
"Great story line - if only they had stuck to the actual plot and not deviated into what I can only describe as seemingly endless, boring self-examination and teen-level philosophizing.",negative
"Started out great, slowed waaaay down in season 3, and totally $h!t the bed in season 4 (specifically episode 7).What started out pretty great ended horribly. SPOILER ALERT: The dad is a chomo. Total trash plot twist ruined a really good story, so much so i didnt even finish the series.Malek, Slater and Wong are great in this but the writers crashed the ship with a totally unnecessary plot twist that got super creepy and ruined the whole story.",negative
This series is one of the best drama series that inspires a good feeling especially for hackers and computer lover and politics enthusiasts.,positive
"I just learned about this show, and decided to give it a try. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons, and thought it was a really cool hacker show, with some psychological aspects. But, in seasons 3 and especially 4, it grew into something much more than that, something amazing. Episodes 407 and the season 4 finale are actually the two greatest episodes of tv I've ever watched. The finale actually had my crying for like 45 minutes and I still can't believe it. This is now, by far, my favorite tv show of all time.",positive
"Yes! In some episodes, you just can't understand what's going on, but you should continue until the 4th season, then you will realize what is all about.Although I don't recommend continuing watching episodes if you don't enjoy them because you should take a long way to the point that puzzle will be solved.",positive
"So modern, I feel so connected while watching. The writing, the ACTING, the sets, the stories are so perfect. I want to watch thew whole series over now that the end is near. It is too good to stop. A story that has not changed since the beginning of human history. This telling is futuristic and mechanical and compelling as everything. Mr. Robot is the best show on whenever it plays. I hope it turns into a classic that will be shown for decades.",positive
I like serie but it was not effective or special. Just for free time when you do not have any option to watch.,negative
"Well USA channel have certainly picked themselves a winner with this one.We are 2 episodes in and I am still not entirely sure what pieces fit where, but in a good way. Story follows a deeply flawed and troubled vigilante hacker named Elliot, who gets pulled into a underground hacking group.I feel like this is a very groundbreaking show as the style is very similar to an 80s-90s cult(?) movie.I can not put my finger on exactly why, but that is the vibe I get from this show.Its slightly artsy in cinematography, but not enough to alienate viewers.I feel like this has the potential to be one of those top 1% shows (GOT, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead etc.)I am very excited to see where they take it.Anyway, I think everyone can enjoy this show.But check it out for yourself. I think you will be glad you did.",positive
"This is the pathetic series i have ever seen. I have wasted so much time thinking something good will come and my wait never ends. Season 2 worst. Is there really any content in this series.I am having headache after watching this. Do you guys really think about the viewer? or making anything. Story is so slow , if you didn't watch few episode it will not impact anything and you will keep yourself away from headache.",negative
"The spoilers are towards the bottom. I really don't want to ruin it for anyone so, do not keep reading until you've watched season 1. I am always searching for something new and unique to watch. I'm movie enthusiast and that's what I use my TV time for the most. I like plot resolutions that don't take 5 years to find out. However, sometimes a series has such a great idea that it drags me in like Mr. Robot does. When I got to the 9th episode, I even yelled out in excitement. I've seen this before but wasn't expecting it! The series had already been taking it much further and I don't feel cheated because of a similar plot. I didn't have any expectations going into it at first but I will for season 2 because this is gold. They just need to keep up their character development and try not to be too clever. Watching does take patience but I found it's worth it, so long as you don't try to binge it all at once. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HERE ARE THE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is Fight Club 1999 without the fight club. Same idea to destroy the world's financial records but with hacking instead of bombs. Elliot Alderson has the same split personality disorder as Tyler Durden. This manifests much the same way the movie does and has me going back to re-watch episodes and scenes. I like to be surprised and the writers did just that. It was also a lot of fun when they subtly played the piano instrumental of ""Where is My Mind"" by The Pixies. This has so many more possibilities and can't wait to see more!",positive
Though its the start but all in all watching the first episode has motivated me to watch it more and its just like more real. I think in my reviews its my 2015 TV show in this year. wish some guys watch this also. The TV show reveals how reality our world is with computers and how to safe guard ourselves from bat attacks. Its somewhat to say a knowledgeable show that i presume that everyone can watch this in this current year. hopefully awaiting for the next release of episode 2. I am not fond of some crime plays but this is somewhat to see.Elliot the hacker reveals how life and science can reveal itself in this life and its somehow real.,positive
"Words can't describe what a masterpiece this show is. Everything was perfect. The characters, the writing, the acting, absolutely everything. The plot twists are just perfect and no episode was boring or bad. The ending of the show is just a perfect way to end this show. The fact that all along we have just been following a fake elliot, only another personality of the real elliot was so confusing but at the same time so beautiful. It would have been nice if we would have seen dom and darlene have a nice life together in budapest but at the same time, it' kinda up to the viewers what they think will happen with they're relationship. The plot twist in 407 was so dark, yet so heartbreaking. It's just so tragic how elliot had to make all of these personalities just because of his disgusting dad. And our elliot, the elliot we have been following since the past 4 seasons, changed the world, he made the world better. This is hands down the best TV show ever made and i am SO glad i watched it. Masterpiece.",positive
"By the time I was nearing the end of the pilot episode, I was cringing. This show is centered around the idea that corporations are bad, people are forcibly imprisoned by debt, and wealth redistribution is a must. Either people are crazy or the ratings are rigged, because there is no way that this series (currently at 9.4) deserves a rating higher than The Walking Dead (8.7), How I Met Your Mother (8.5), The Office (8.8), Wayward Pines (8.2), this show even got higher than Sherlock the 2010 TV series (9.3). Not only is the idea that this show is spreading so anti-capitalistic it makes me nauseous, but the acting was mediocre and the tech aspect unrealistic (nowhere near 9.4 quality). The main character also glorifies stalking, drug use, and teenage angst in a grown person (I hesitate to refer to him as a man).",negative
"It was a mediocre attempt to make something special, filled with unnecessary twists and bad writing and directing.
Total waste of time.",negative
"So deep and filled with so many brilliant ideas , issues of life that you need to think about

"Mr. Robot is one of those rare shows that constantly delivers a sense of suspense and confusion without making it seem too forced or uninspiring. It is about a hacker who suffers from insecurity and a drug addiction, and is seemingly pulled into a plan to hack the system and erase all debt in the country. He ultimately has to face his own morality and psyche to find out the truth of the world and events that transpire around him. This show does a great job at keeping us in the dark enough to where we don't know what is happening while still being able to think everything is much simpler than it is. You will be shocked yet satisfied with the final episodes of this first season, and you will want to re- watch the whole show to see how it adds up.The story is fantastic, and the many supporting characters and their arcs make for a great bigger picture. My personal favorite character is Tyrell due to the overall mystery of his motives and plans. He is someone who constantly seems to teeter between protagonist and antagonist as the show progresses. He is basically the Tyrian Lannister of Mr. Robot; he has his own motive and is unarguably an awesome character.I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who loves a good mystery with interesting characters and plot. #where'sTyrell?",positive
"I know little bit about how technology and real world running after I mess with some of my pro hacker friends on social media and forum. What I seeing that graphical describes here in the show. Especially Rami played as well as Christiane(Mr. Robot). Also Dom (FBI women) played very well. Actually their paranormal shots caught me not to avoid its mystery. And I won't.

I did find myself however instantly connecting specific scenes in this show with other works - most notably ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"".PROS: Stylish, good lead actors and some thought-provoking morality concepts re: technology CONS: Very similar to other work as listed above, have a hard time seeing ability to sustain this plot line for too long (but I'm sure studios will try!)All in all, I'll keep watching for a bit. Heck, I can think of many worse movies to borrow story lines from!",negative
Sam Esmail please it's time for a spin off.... This was just one of the best Tv shows ever made... the world needs more details that focus on things not covered on the original work.,positive
"The first episode's plot turned on a ""Personal IP Address"".1) That doesn't exist -- People aren't assigned IP Addresses -- Devices you use will be assigned an IP address. -- Today, this is generally a dynamic address from a pool of available addresses. -- However, this assignment will also be logged, so it can associated with a specific device (specifically its MAC address). And then, the primary user of the device.2) There is no reason for Trojan-horse malware to be tied to anything personally identifiable. A more realistic approach would been to have compromise the target's computer first, and use it to plant the Trojan. FBI computer forensics could have then been called in to back-track to the the source of the hack. -- Could have commented on the amateurish approach of the CTO as evidenced by his getting caught. This would only bolster the likelihood of him being the culprit as a real hacker wouldn't get caught, or at least so easily. 3) Finally, most egregiously, if you are going to show an IP Address to demonstrate the show's ""tech-savvyness""... It should be valid address.",positive
"Mr Robot starts off it's season as a normal drama. But as it progresses it goes so deep that you'll have some time to shake off the effects of an amazing ride. It deals with mental disorders, drug abuse, consumerism, physical abuse, trauma and finally 'Identity crisis'.The camera work is all stunning, especially in the final seasons there are lot of long shots Which is perfect. The screenplay is cringe worthy in many places but the final season will leave you in tears. The character arc of Angela was a major dissapointment for me though. Sure, to start a season with killing off one of the major characters will definitely get reactions from audience but I felt it was not the right way to end her story.But the finale was heart melting, Elliott finally getting into terms with everything. MM finally letting go and giving back the control. It was perfect.",positive

"I have a lot to say about this series, but will try my best to be brief. Going through the first episode of Mr. Robot was intense - the series came out with a very strong, attention-grabbing pilot and it's no wonder why there came tons of positive reviews and expectations. It directly approaches themes that are not only good for an action- filled story but also very eminent and widely discussed nowadays - the world of hacking and the possibility (or the dream) of an anti-capitalist, worldwide revolution, featuring very obvious references to the (now pretty obsolete) Anonymous network in real life. As the series progresses, though, both themes start showing as more of a background to the big focus on the main character Elliot's psyche.After the pilot the plot slows down and about halfway into the season it becomes clear the show couldn't keep its beginning pace and starts to come out of its trails into a more boring, irrelevant narrative. It is only from the seventh episode on that it seems to regain pace and attempts to revitalize itself with a series of plot twists and a re-approach to the said Revolution that has been worked on a bit under the sheets. Though it is interesting to have a neuroatypical, socially avoidant character, the show doesn't make much use of Elliot's impairments aside from frequently presenting him as a pretentious, if not arrogant narrator. Elliot's constant judging of the ""outside world"" and its oh-so-ordinary, Starbucks-consuming inhabitants falls into a cliché and superficial discourse, reinforcing the stereotypical dichotomy between ""sociable and dumb people"" & ""introverted and intelligent people"". The barriers that Elliot admits to put between himself and others reveal narcissistic undertones - at the same time the main character has a multitude of internal problems, he's also the one who's most highly thought of by himself. The show builds weak secondary characters (such as his therapist) to take this view further on and it's impossible to know whether it intends to make Elliot's arrogance explicit or to support the character's point of view as something to admire - in any way, it constantly makes the script seem to have been written by a socially awkward 8th grader.The series clearly invests a lot in its visuals - it is very pleasant to look at, featuring a good use of colors (most of the time quite saturated) and unique photography. In regards to acting: while Rami Malek shines in his role, along with Christian Slater and Carly Chaikin, many other characters are not as believable. Tyrell Wellick's character is not at all convincing - Martin Wallström's faces makes his role seem more appropriate as a juvenile comedy villain, while Angela's range of expressions resemble Kristen Stewart's Bella in the Twilight Saga. Mr. Robot's main plot structures come out as familiar, somewhat resembling an union between Wachowski's The Matrix and Fincher's Fight Club. The series, however, struggles to deliver the Tyler Durden- esque plot twist in a way that is both mind-blowing and unpredictable; while some may argue that it's a big part of the series' genius aspect, it comes off as a far reach and quite unnecessary. Perhaps the biggest problem with Mr. Robot is that digging through its more superficial layers (the plot twists, the narration, the action scenes, the main character's unreliability) we find an artificial core that fails to justify the elements above it and tie them together, creating a constant sense of phoniness and giving the viewer no significant basis to rely on - we're left with no way of knowing where the story is going, and why. Taking the previously mentioned Fight Club as an example, our trust for the image of the main character is shattered towards the ending, but the viewer still has something to rely on - his ideology, which stays clear and strong until the end of the movie. When the viewers' trust for Elliot collapses, we find nothing behind the curtains - no motivation that remains solid. The character himself doesn't know exactly what he is doing or why; and for a series that relies so much on a strong ideological discourse this leaves a great feeling of emptiness, opposite of what it should be like. Though entertaining with its thought-out visuals, interesting thematics and attempts at quirkiness, Mr. Robot repeatedly bites more than it can chew, slowly revealing itself to be just as superficial as all the people the main character insists to judge.",negative
"Mr Robot is was a surprising and refreshing find, - I stumbled on it by accident. The acting is quite good especially Elliot and the psycho effects well done, I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of most American made series these days, that is over stretching the plot so it becomes tedious and then looping over themes endlessly, of late it seems American script writers have forgotten that a good story needs a start a middle and an end. and that the end is as important a part as the any other. thus far it seems OK although its a tad predictable. with 2 episodes to go, lets hope the writers are courageous enough to let this one have a worthy ending.",positive
"I've watched the whole of series one & eagerly awaited each episode since the first. Inside everyone is a little bit of Elliot. Maybe not as #£%ed up but still a little bit of him is inside us all but maybe not as obvious. With each weekly session he's been opened to us with a new aspect of what we all hide, whether it be our dream of a shinning white armor hidden in beneath our dark & dreary daily dress, our secret vice that calms & soothes our darkest dreams & stormiest nights, our lost loves (that may have not quite been there - real or not), & our fogged perception of what is our world around us. For some dark & for some torpid reason I click with Elliot. He is real & not a Disney fairytale in 21st century 3D 4k color. Watch it. It's well worth the effort. The closing track seems to encompass the whole of series 1 - where is my mind? I eagerly await season 2. :)",positive
"This is something you can't stop watching. You really feel the emotions of ""mr. Robot"". Also a must see for all IT guy's. For me it's one of the best tv series ever.",positive
"It is a good story. The making is VERY good. If you have enough patience, you can give it a try. Here is a list of the negative aspects of this show. Of course these are my personal options and no one has to agree with me. 1. Way too much voice-over: The entire show is full of voice-over of the leading character Elliot. Sometimes it managed to get on my nerves. 2. Poor voice-over: Yes I know that the voice-over is supposed be like that (lifeless/depressing), but when you have to listen to that for that long, it has to be better. If Morgan Freeman gets 10 out of 10 for his style of narration, this dude will get something like .00001 or .00002. 3. Very slow paced: The pace of the show could have been a bit faster. It becomes a bit boring at times. 4. Not enough twists: Yes there are a lot of twists but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.Although this was not one of my favorite TV series, I have finished watching the 1st season because of the very high rating on IMDb. Hope the 2nd season will be better.",positive
"What starts as a story against capitalistic forces slowly becomes just riveting TV and film-making. Genuinely a fantastic show if you can weather out the slump in the first half of the second season.The story is fantastic as well as the show knows exactly how it's going to end from the beginning. That's something you don't get too often from a TV, as many just get stretched into oblivion.The 4th and final was satisfying overall, though it was also in a way still heartbreaking.Here is how I would rank the seasons:

Or was it the fifth of brandy .Don't know don't care, as always a much watch .This is a look into another dimension or am I just a projection looking at the real world. Wow wow wow wow wow.This actually reminds me of films like blade runner, A clockwork orange and 28 days later. It had me standing beside myself.

"Mr Robot has a good premise, superb acting (for the most part) and has some really up-to-date and novel ideas. However, between the long, unnecessary pause in dialogue and constant staring, it could have been a fantastic one season show but it dragged unnecessarily.This is the kind of program that when you start you really enjoy, and because you're the kind of person who will finish the series when you've started it, you'll be glad you're watching on a tablet so you can '+10 seconds' relentlessly because most episodes can be watched in three minutes without missing any important details or dramatic effect.I'm undecided if I hate this show because it has some really good points, especially the premise, but I would only recommend it to a person who can start watching, enjoy and then give up when they've had enough; it makes me wish I was that kind of person.",negative
"Definitely worth the watch, it is one of the better TV shows I have watched. It takes an unexpected turn towards the end of the season and was an overall entertaining show. Rami Malek has played the character amazingly and really does look natural in his role. Episode 6 is my favourite throughout the season as it has a huge twist which shows off the directors' ideas. I am also into computing which makes this show much more enjoyable, and having the ability to hack into peoples lives looks like a very interesting concept as he can do practically anything he wants by accessing peoples' private lives. I cannot wait until season 2 and I do not have any clue as to what will happen because of the cliffhanger at the end of season 1. I would highly recommend this to a friend.",positive
"I can't describe how amazing this show is. I am very very grateful to those who contribute Mr. Robot. Every bit of show from starting to the episode end, it makes you think, thrill, enjoy, feel and more over excite to the core of your heart.Mind blowing performance by the actors and lead roles.Every cell in your blood excites to the core of your brain making blood flow faster than you might think.I must recommend this for everyone. This is must watch for coding guys out there. It is a brilliant way of comparing coding to the actual real life situations in each episode.Simply wow.

"This show is incredible. the cinematography alone is amazing. Its like the shining meets Fargo. the camera angles and symmetry draw you in and show you real life intensities to the point where you forget you're watching a screen.the main character tells us whats going on through his brain but more importantly what he allows the world to see him as. we get to get an inside look at the life of a social anxiety ridden junkie who finds power in knowing someones entire life without them knowing him.usually when i watch hacking movies or shows, i get confused by the terms but since we get to hear Elliot's thoughts as we go its easier to understand.very powerful show. cant wait to see more.",positive
"The cinematography and sound re-create the cool, chaotic, and chilling unease of Aronofsky films like Requiem for a Dream and Pi. I can definitely see a connection to Fight Club as well, both with the mood and the beautiful inner monologues. I see references to Dexter also, as the monologues often focus on Elliot's inability to connect ""normally"" with others and the plot itself mimics Dexter in that Elliot essentially moonlights as the antagonist to his daylight self, hacker v.s. security agent. Unlike Dexter and Fight Club's Tyler Burden, Elliot appears far more emotionally sensitive (naturally, without the addiction to self-help groups) and does not carry out his justice according to a strict creed of violence, but rather through anonymous tips and expert framing. I also see a nod to the directorial themes of Michelangelo Antonioni (Italian Neorealism), with the emphasis on alienation in a large, busy, or distant modern world; for example scans of the massive billboards and buildings and the constant suspicious stares of men in suits or deadpans of passersby. Unlike Antonioni, who's cinematic conversations deliberately trailed off into somewhat unbearable uncertainty, Sam Esmail zooms his lens on a more specific and perhaps more translatable realm, the digital age through the perspective of its best hackers. As audience to this new series, I hope to comfortably ""hack"" my way through Elliot's disturbingly penetrative exploration of contemporary life. Rami Malek's performance is gritty, honest, subtle, and mesmerizing. The script is pointy, poetic, and I feel reveals deep truths of human interaction and of the new age inner psyche. Bravo!",positive
"The show's premise is great and it explores it in interesting ways. It always plays with your head and subverts expectations. Some episodes seem to miss the point and be a bit weird but there is most often a payoff to this. You just need to be patient, trust the process and enjoy it as it goes.",positive
"Elliot, played by Rami Malik, pulls of great show.

This constant produce and consumption is robbing earth of its finite resources.Lets wake up from the this drugged slumber and invent better life for us all .",positive
"OK. I give the show 8/10 because the camera angles are so off-kilter that even boring scenes are watchable. Loved the pilot episode. I wish the series continued along that path of self contained episodes instead of the overdone stretched storyline. Some episodes went in a different direction without a good reason. What was the deal with the drug dealing gangsters and why kill the chick? Tyrell makes some of the most ridiculous ""plays""at getting the promotion. If that is a way to represent his instability the it is way overdone. Actually all the characters are very much unstable and socially retarded. Yet, for all the dumb plot twists and inexplicable behaviours of the main characters, I am drawn to the show. The reason, Rami Malek. His portrayal of Elliot shows that you don't need to act larger than life to be noticed. He doesn't have the looks of a Hollywood star. He plays a weirdo, anti-hero who ha no real redeeming character traits, yet if not for him, the show would have lost me a long time ago. Christian Slater is the exact opposite. Luckily, he goes missing for large portions of the show. There is another, DB Wong as Whiterose. Just outstanding and I hope series 2 will have a lot more of him. There it is, a show that should not work, possibly becomes a classic. All in spite of the writers and producers seemingly trying to kill it as fast as possible. Awesome.",positive
"When I watched Lord of the Rings or the Never Ending Story I expected anything because that's what happens in magical worlds. In Mr. Robot the writer pushed too much, the premise was good but he failed in the most important element: details.Instead of wasting valuable minutes of airtime describing ridiculously complex conundrums, he should have given more background details to certain characters or elaborate some scenes in a more intelligent way. The end of the 3rd season was ridiculous, that guy knew where Mr. Robot lived and couldn't find him later, come on! The same with the Black Army not being able to find him in the 4th season after all the episodes describing their power to do EVERYTHING they want all over the world.These are just a couple of examples to show how absurd the plot was most of the time.",negative
"Only two shows have ever WOW'd me - True Detective Season 1, and Mr. Robot. Though entirely different subjects, Mr. Robot features the same intricacies and attention to detail that few series are able to touch on with great interest. Though many mention the performance of Christian Slater, it's my opinion that Rami Malek is the stand- out actor and character making this a stand-out series. His performance draws you into his ever-flawed person of a character. To play that kind of character without making a joke of it, or making it utterly cringe-worthy is something I do not count as easy. A special type of person is needed to play such a reserved, yet inner-tormented character without giving way to their own personal personality as a person (not an actor). You truly believe Rami is no one else but Elliot. He isn't Rami playing Elliot on screen, he is Elliot in this series. I cannot wait for the second season, as we delve deeper into the spiraling out of Elliot's mind as he encounters new challenges and unexpected events. I also am interested to see how the other characters develop as well, as they seem to be making progress of their own. What else is hiding that we don't know about? That Elliot doesn't know about?",positive

"maybe the best new series i've seen in a long while. story is credible, capturing the zeitgeist very well. shot framing is captivating, pacing on point, and possible the high note of the whole production, the soundtrack, is simply outstanding!you can certainly see similarities to the girl with the dragon tattoo, seeing they share the same director. it has the same eerie ""something i wrong"" feeling. but it is a bit faster paced with nice catch phrases in-between. in general the writing of the dialogs is so good, even side characters feel like real human being after just a scene or two, for example Gideon. Those little details make a show and in this case, they got it right. kudos.all in all, i hope they are able to keep the momentum that they built up with this pilot.i'm so excited for the rest of the season.",positive
"This series will be more meaningful and captivating than the Matrix trilogies. The Mr Robot scripts show incredible perceptions and understanding of today's world ,how it works and what is needed to fix it. By comparison the Matrix was too futuristic and lost some dynamic mental impacting in the process. This series is the tip of the teeth of the cutting edge consciousness of the newly awakening masses. It depicts a new growing humanity with real practical workable ethics and values empowered through high tech activism. Nothing motivating like this has been seen since the JFK speeches and Peace Corps of the 60s. The new hippies are super intelligent, dress well and are armed with high tech weaponry aimed at changing the incredible plight of the oppressed working and non working masses. The series carries off this world shaking theme with incredible sensitivity and spectacular perceptions. It has something for everyone. Challenging mentally, socially interacting and entertaining with moments of great impacting drama and significance.",positive

"The screenplay is exceptional, about as good and as topical as it gets, however: This would have gone NOWHERE without an extraordinary actor to pull off the lead character (and the sophisticated direction necessary to produce that acting). They hit a grand slam with their choice, Rami Malek. I had not personally seen him before, the role reads as though he were born to play it. Not that this makes it easy, this looks to be a significantly sophisticated performance by a young actor in the role of his career (I'm guessing) to date. Add in a serendipitously psycho Christian Slater thespian study (yeah, that was easy!) and you get something really fun, remarkably fast, and on top of todays headlines. Enjoy!",positive

"Well, i watched the first episode of this serial. And yes i like it. But i have big problems with this simple classification of people in good and evil in this show. It is basically a modern Robin Hood story. The protagonist is a hacker and the viewer get a picture of the world from his position. Unfortunately, there are only four types of characters in this show: men who are smart but evil, men who are good but stupid, men who are smart and good (this men are hackers, including the protagonist. Of course!!) and women who are good, beautiful and needs protection from the evil environment! Well, this trash must be created in a brain of a male teenager with low self confidence and omnipotent fantasies :) Nevertheless, i like this show! The reason is, i can ignore the weak character-description, because it is the way how the protagonist see the world and it is not automatically the ""truth"" or the message which stands behind this show. But still this show is not breaking bad!",positive
"What a complete waste of time. I watched the full first season. The main plot twists were quite easy to foresee quite early in the show, leading to absolutely no surprise during the reveal. Some scenes make no sense with real life with no in-world reason why. For example, one scene shows someone offering another person a job with ""ten of his most annoying lawyers"" and then sends them off to discuss privately with the person. None of that scene makes sense. All characters have only one dimension and no depth at all. The main character won't stop moaning about how he wishes he'd be normal.

"Hello friend, ""Mr. Robot"" presents it self as show about depression, anxiety, social problems, and AMAZING HACKING SKILLS with just a few fast taps on a keyboard. The series shows a great perspective through the brand new IT and mobile world The main actor ""Rami Malek"" as ""Elliot Alderson"" doesn't sell very well his part, other than being able to maintain the same facial expression through the entire episode. Some emotional scenes (related with his depression and distrust with the world and ""the man"") have a great message but i cannot help but feel that all this emotions and thoughts are just being pushed down my throat. Now the main event: FIGHT CLUB inspiration (and maybe also a bit tribute): - his father was himself. all his father's actions and accomplishments were in fact accomplished by Elliot Alderson. (Tyler Durden form Fight Club) -Mr. Robot has the same goal as Tyler Durden: to collapse the economic industry. One way or another they hate pretty much the same things and both want an economic breakdown of the economy (and society). - in the last scene of s01 ep09 when Elliot Alderson is showing Tyrell Wellick the safe place of fsociety guess witch music is playing! ""Where is my mind"" the same song that is played in the infamous last scene of Fight Club (tribute?).In conclusion, its a good TV Series but the main casting should have been better chosen, has all the plot twist clichés that we like to see. ALL OF THEM, and that kind of helps the bad image I have that this show seems a bit poorly manufactured (following a recipe: catchy phrases like hello friend, a death of a close one, a murder by a mad arch enemy etc etc). 7",positive

"Don't have a lot of details to give out other than my own enjoyment. This is definitely one series I will be looking forward to. I'm already hooked! Love the suspense and the narration, the character is quirky, a complete introvert so I can identify. This is more of what I was expecting ""Black Hat"" to be. Regrettably it did not come close. So far there is no addition of ""love"" potion into the story line. There is a hint of underlying admiration, but none of that American formula of throwing in a love interest for the sake of having one. Thank you.The main character is, as I said quirky, but it adds to the complexity of who this person is on the inside and the outside. I identify with him because at times I too have been disappointed by society's lustful greed for power and money.Can't wait for the next episode.",positive
"OK, so there is part of me looking through my old DVD collection including Hackers, The Matrix, The Net and even Die Hard 4.0. However, the brilliant (!!!!) soundtrack, especially the music composed by Mac Quayle, reminding me of a mix of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' works, combined with the fact that the protagonist keeps talking to me as if I was there, plus the actual film work - it's the kind of series you want to watch more and more of - especially as it's twisted enough to leave you discussing it with friends or family over dinner. Great to see Christian Slater again after so long - and he's fabulous although a little young to be playing the Dad. The choice of Rami Malek is amazing - what an unusual character. Reminds me of Jack Nicholson in a way, you cannot tell the difference between the personality in the film and in real life. The wait for season 2 seems endless....2016? come on. Hurry up.",positive
"I'm a little late to the party and just watched Season 1 but wow this is a great show. Thought provoking, entertaining and everything else I want from my television. The appeal of the show is in large part due to the actor portraying Elliot. He is not your stereotypical chisel jawed hero. There is pain in his eyes and a darkness in his soul. You find yourself drawn into his struggle against the evils of corporations as well as his own demons.Rami Malek is an unusual star who deserves all the accolades he has received. And while Christian Slater is mostly over the top in his performance, his dynamic with Elliot is fascinating and keeps you gripped episode to episode.",positive
This show was really something. Like for someone who is into technology and hacking this show is recommendation. And also this is this kind of show that it's hack is real for example the simplest one the one that Elliot resets the admin password on a locked computer and i tried it and knew it before watching Mr. Robot so everything is accurate. My rating for Mr.robot is 9 more precisely 9.5 the reason i didn't give 10 was because of season 2 the season was a little boring but aside of that the actors especially Rami Malek (Elliot Alderson) And Christian Slater (Mr Robot) was something else and the plot especially like sometimes i felt like i was lost and especially the ending was Scooby Doo stuff but it was amazing and the songs was amazing so basically this show easily goes to my favorite show of all time👏🏼,positive
"I watched the final season, and I want to say a big thank you to everyone who worked on the creation of the series. Guys, you are great!The story of Elliot, a young gifted programmer with a difficult childhood, who realizes that his skills and knowledge allow him to administer justice to bad people, that he can change the world for the better. And his accidental entry into a group of hackers who are going to destroy the existing banking system, which is owned by billionaires, and keeps people around the world in slavish dependence on money.An incredible story that was wrapped up in four short seasons, fully thought out from the first to the last episode. The plot on paper seems a little banal, but in reality it turns out that this is only the mask of the series, and even this mask is in fact very well done. It's just a paradise for fans of Fight Club - such a description can be given to the series based on the first season, but the further it goes, the more the story twists, and everything is so subtle that you forget about Fight Club like a book that you read once very long ago in school.",negative
"It's been said that all of the best writers have gone to television because it's the best medium for them to communicate their ideas (rather than quashing creativity in favour of shorter run-times and fingers-crossed-it-doesn't-bomb sequels). This saying couldn't me more truthful when considering the beautiful television we've had the last decade (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Suits to name a few). Mr. Robot is the latest welcome addition to an already stacked arsenal of today's greatest hits. This show has captivated me from the very beginning. The writing is incredible and when speaking of the internal dialogue the lead runs through in particular, this show can be placed in my top 5 of all time. The way they've captured the perspective of someone with a mental illness is impeccable. I don't want to get into too much detail in fear I may brush over a spoiler, but this is definitely one of this show's crowning achievements (of which there are many). There is a very low-level of predictability here as well. I've found my mouth agape multiple times with a number of the twists and turns the plot takes along its path through quandary. 10/10 on that front. The acting is some of the best I've seen. If Rami doesn't get an Emmy or AT THE VERY LEAST a nomination, I will aggressively download malware and execute it willingly while laughing like a maniac. The camera work is excellent as well, with some very creative and insightful choices for lighting/angle as well as unique methods to capture space. (i.e. camera attached to door as it opens). Above all, the music is really what steals the show here. I've never encountered a show with this level of auditory finesse before. Mac Quayle has really created something special here. His soundscape is modern and enthrallingly relevant to the subject matter. I've compared it to some of Trent Reznors work to some extent but it is totally on it's own in terms of creative boundary. I'd love to hear who he's drawn some of his inspiration from.Anyways, all in all this show has done nothing but genuinely entertain me on the deepest, most impactful level. Beautifully written, directed, composed for, acted, paced, and filmed. I hope it receives all of the recognition it deserves and I can't wait for more! 10/10 MASTERFUL WORK",positive

"I don't watch many TV shows because I usually get easily bored by them. None has grabbed my attention quite as good as Mr Robot. The pilot does a fantastic job of introducing the premise of the show in an entertaining fashion, and I can't recall a single episode that I felt nothing happened (which happens a lot with other TV shows I've tried to watch). That isn't to say that the show isn't slow at times, but when it is, it is for a reason. When I finished watching the first 3 seasons, I wrote the following review on my Snapchat story to try to get more people (more specifically, more of my friends) to watch this TV show:Mr Robot's seasons 1-3 might feel slow at moments, but everything that is ""filler"" comes back at some point and when this show pays off, IT PAYS OFF.I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for a show to watch, and also to anyone who isn't. This show is shot like a movie and amount of the time put into writing it shows.Seasons 1 and 2 are available for people with Amazon Prime. If you start watching and feel bored, watch at least until the 9th episode before dropping the show, that's when the 1st big payoff happens.",positive
This is a truly masterpiece with one of the best ending in TV history,positive
"With possibly one of the best pilots in TV history, Mr.Robot immediately draws you in. The story mainly revolves around Elliot Anderson(Rami Malek), who is a hacking genius, is extremely shy and anti-social and is unable to connect to people in the ordinary sense. Instead, he hacks everyone he meets in an attempt to connect with them and in the process, helps a lot of people. He lives a life of solitude and hates his job, but then one day he's approached by a very mysterious man who goes by the name of Mr.Robot(Christian Slater), who seeks to recruit him for a top secret mission. This show is a great concept and is brilliantly executed (so far).It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is massively entertaining. Its likely that most viewers will relate to at least one of the characters, seeing that they cover such a broad spectrum of personalities, each with their own set of troubles. Its presented in a very unique way that feels fresh and innovative. The acting too, is brilliant and very convincing. I am very optimistic about this show and hope that it continues at the same pace it is currently going.",negative
"When I first heard about this series I thought ""it must be another Hollywood garbage with unrealistic-2seconds NASA hacking and stuff"", but...WOW! Mr. Robot is one of those memorable, fun, intense and heart touching series that I was needing (Breaking Bad I still miss you ='( ). The direction is awesome, I caught myself almost punching my computer screen in some intense moments. The cast is really good too, you can easily forget you're watching a television series if you don't watch out! And the story...! Completely great and catching! I STRONGLY recommend this series. If you want to watch something you wont forget after the first episode or after your whole life, watch this.(sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm still learning English)",positive
"WOW! This show just keeps on giving. Once you think you've seen enough, the next episode comes along and blows the previous one away. The writers make it very personal, and they have a way to make you part of the show. In many ways what happens to Elliot, could happen to anyone. From the way he can be an ordinary everyday person, or a super hero or super villain the next, you're on a roller-coaster of emotions towards the character. Episode 7 prompted me to get off my b't and start writing about it. How did I start watching it? I can't remember now, but I think it was about my inclination towards computer sciences. But this show is much more than that. It's a drama that contains all aspects of a great show, and is sure to get it's audience of all ages (over 16) involved in a conversation at their next gathering.",positive
"It's brilliant. Sam Esmail has crafted a masterpiece of a show that's led by outstanding acting from Rami Malek, Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin and the rest of this perfect cast. Everything about it is fantastic (dialogue, acting, cinematography and story) but season 4 has taken my breath away. I can't stress how good this is; so, do yourself a favour and watch it.",positive
"I've started to watch it on 2015, when it was launched, and it was one of the best decisions i've ever made. A GREAT show, with a great history, it's wonderful and priceless to discover why all that things were happening. I'm rewatching now with my gf, and i keep my word, this show is awesome, probably the best i've ever watched. Thank you Sam Esmail, you're a genius.",positive
"Serial talks about the personal performance of Elliot (Rami Malek), which speaks of being somewhat socially troubled people face problems in communicating with other people, but Mo as bad Elly makes it very strange phases, it appears to the viewer as someone bigger than that.After the second episode appreciate I say that the series presented himself strongly As one of the best television business this year Labour productivity is excellent value and level of writing And to more thing I liked is that the series in the construction phase from scratch However moments of boredom is almost non-existent For this I wrote in my blog about the subject www.psychopass.tkthank you",positive
"The story is very deep and heavy, and the characters development is in my opinion flawless. It's shot in an interesting way, breaking standard filming angles. I recently re-watched it and did so on two days, because every episode leaves you wanting more, and it's even better the next time because of their extraordinary work at details. The moment I realized it's all in his head I had to pause the video because it became to overwhelming. My favorite part is the inner monologues he keeps having, which makes it much easier to become emerged in the plot and characters. This show got 10/10 from me because I reckon I will remember this for the rest of my life, and the insight and expansion I got was very rewarding.",positive
"Best Geek cyber drama to date the pilot is beautifully written can't wait to see where the rest of the season goes.Recently i watched Some top rated TV series. Mr. Robot is one of them.Finally this kind of information is made for mainstream audience. The series goes in details how messed up the world is . how unfair the capitalistic Market-based Debt slavery ,what we call earn money for life is . how the fiat currency is destroying the world as we know it . Such an outdated form of Economic and world Management is wasteful and dangerous.What a refreshing new show!I like plot resolutions that don't take 5 years to find out. However, sometimes a series has such a great idea that it drags me in like Mr. Robot does.",positive
"This show has to be one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen. Did not have much expectation however it is mind blowing. The acting, direction, cinematography, background score.. especially background score and the the style of storytelling is amazing. The way they have portrayed the technical aspects of the show feel very real as well. The show creators have added a lot of little details that are great of people who are tech savvy. However still kept it simple enough for audience that might not understand something extremely technical. I don't want to write much about the show as even little details can spoil it. Its better if you watch the show not knowing what to expect.",positive
"The first season of Mr.Robot is a must-see if you are into wickedly smart plot twists, beautiful characters with depth, psychology, philosophy, tech or politics and love a good anarchy theme. It is fresh, exciting and worth your time. The season is well put together and the episodes are so enthralling you can not wait to see the next one unfold. The casting of Rami Malek is an inspired choice. The acting of the main character is natural and believable, so much so I wonder if it is actually acted at all. He takes awkward to a level of true brilliance and depicts it in a way I have not seen before on screen. The psychological issues he deals with are shown in a way it does not dehumanize him, he remains completely relatable and yet unrelatable enough to not know what is coming next.The breaking of the forth wall may be unsettling for some, but I thought it added an extra dimension to my experience as a viewer, actively creating a sense of being part of the unfolding of the plot and bringing up an experience where the show became an extension of my own mind. The urge to say something back came up more than once, as my empathy for the main characters plight was fully engaged.The theme of the show is a poignant reminder of the state of our society, already set in the first episode of the season. The show has the ability to reach through the screen and touch that part of you that questions the direction society has taken. By pointing at the flaws of capitalism and constantly reiterating our loneliness, it almost shows us a 'behind the scenes' of humanity in its current phase.Are there no criticisms? Sure, to criticise is human after all, one could focus on the hypocrisy displayed by the main character in the first few episodes, the casting of Christian Slater which I find unnecessary and at times his fame makes it a tad difficult to suspend disbelieve as it is a constant reminder this is in fact a television show, or perhaps one could mention an episode where drugs took over and it left us with an unsatisfied feeling, a lack of depth that the more tech minded were craving. Don't give up after this episode though, it will not disappoint. For me these and other points that come up pale in comparison to the brilliance this show has to offer.I can't wait to watch the second season and hope they won't drag the show out too long. This level of excellence is hard to keep up after all.Brilliant, engaging, refreshing and sublimely casted, 10 out of 10 for me.",positive
"Hello readers, This series is a must watch! It's a great story and very realistic.I was surprised by how interested I was!! The name MR Robot didn't give me the feeling it would be that good...I even thought that it would be kind of a sci-fi, but it's not!Actors are great too! Camera technique is very good! Story is very catching and every minute is interesting! Normally i need some violence in a movie, but this one doesn't need it for sure!Now I want to see more of this and I'm sure there are more peeps like me who are addicted now!",positive
"Pres. Clinton and the United States Marine Corps spent $3.8 millions teaching me to blow the whistle on this, I'm right in the middle of doing that. I figured since I'm now allowed to talk about it, I can give this web site proof I can talk about it, I'll tell you what the end game of the top 1% of the 1% is. They want to change the Constitution so they can bring about the kind of globalization they want, think modern dark ages. How they plan to do it is so strange I'm not even going to try yet, maybe in a year or so. This is a great show, with some interesting ideas, but let me say this, KEEP IT PEACEFUL!!! No matter what your being told there is a way for the military to step in and take control of the Country. Violence will bring that about very quickly, and the bad guys win. As long as you do the right thing for all the right reasons, you'll be surprised how much support you get, as soon as you try and profit from it you go down. If your trying to fix things what you do has to be a ""truly selfless act."" Last thing, when I was briefed in on this back in 1995, I was told Hollywood would play a role in this, I'd say this show is evidence that they where right about that too.",positive
"I have to get something off my chestGreat show, it is maybe in the tier of true detective (~9/10, dark, modern, good argument), butThe 'fight club' plot was too obvious, it wasn't even a twist (post episode 9) who didn't think this was going to happen since episode 1..Just wishing for something more interesting to develop, and it didn't(By the way, the casting of the Swedish couple... Perfect. Elliot and his dad as well of course but the Swedish couple interactions are crazy good)Still, i obviously recommend this show and am very curious for season 2",positive
"Mr Robot is quite possibly one of if not the best television programme I have ever watched. OK, firstly it is the first TV show that I have seen that has competently and consistently used the correct terminology when talking about computers, the only mistake that I noticed was one character's mispronunciation of the word ""DDoS"" and that's pretty subjective and nit-picky anyway. I usually refrain from watching shows based around tech as I am quite knowledgeable in that regard and it makes my cringe when they make silly errors, not the case here. The programme's format is similar to that of Dexter's, a narrated monologue as Elliot hunts a different target each episode, at least for the first few episodes. The writing was immaculate throughout, I was hooked instantly and ended up watching the whole series over a single weekend. OK, so here's where I'm going to go into slight spoilery territory so be warned. I found the gradual deterioration of Elliot's mental health throughout the series spectacular. You are given subtle hints at the beginning that Elliot may be having hallucinations but the way it comes together at the series' conclusion was mesmerizing. The ending to episode nine was particularly compelling leaving me with goosebumps and the homage to Fight Club with a piano rendition of The Pixie's ""where is my mind"" was a nice touch considering the show has clearly taken inspiration from that film. Anyway, I absolutely recommend this series to anyone with an interest in technology, as it certainly satisfies that demographic and even people that don't as it still holds up as a damn good and well written psychological thriller.",positive
"i like the show and the lead actor plays the socially awkward guy well, even though most hackers aren't like that at all.the thing that destroyed this show for me is that his day job was being a hacker and the things he does at night is very far from hacking.if the writer had done any research about the hacker community he wouldn't have had a story.",negative
Well.. Recently i watched Some top rated TV series. Mr. Robot is one of them. For me the best TV series till Now is Breaking Bad. Mr. Robot Placed 2nd in my fav list. The story Line is awesome.

"This first season was very well done and you can tell that it may have not originally been filmed for TV and maybe for cable. The characters and story line carry itself very well. The dark contrast in the film and editing are very well done as well to set the mood. I like to think that as one who works as a programmer there are few shows that fit my liking. If I want something clean and funny I will go toward the Big Bang Theory. If I am looking for a show that is funny with no holds barred I recommend Silicon Valley, But if I want a suspenseful drama Mr Robot is definitely the series that I would recommend. We can only hope that the edginess of the characters, the story line, plot and the script that is in season 1 keeps on in future seasons to come.",positive
I know many may have a different opinion but this is one of the best shows i have seen in a while . And i definitely recommend for you to see it regardless of what you like to see . The main reason i would say this is because it has the thrill and adventure as well reality in it so if you like to see superhero stuff or reality shows or any other shows it blends to it . A point to note is it is different from our regular show which makes it stand out of all the other shows out there . But i will give it a 10/10 for the first season AND i hope the make it more better as the characters develop and so should the plot . I know this is not like a review but my god i just had to comment on this show.,positive
Great actor rami great serie ONE in The best begins and The great endings. I'm very like this Mr. Robot it's one my top series ever made The acting The story The cinematographique very cool i am just happy to watch this serie. Great actor rami great serie ONE in The best begins and The great endings.,positive
"I actually love the show a lot.only reason I have given this show a 7 out of 10 is because it lack originality. mr robot reminds me way to much about Dexter. The show has a socially awkward human being aka Dexter who talks to himself, shuts out the people around him, pretends to have normal human emotions and collects ""trophies"" of people who have died or files he has worked on. The show is actually amazing so far, will get repetitive from what I can tell and is way to similar to Dexter, even his blonde friend reminds me of Dexter's sister. Mr Robot himself reminds me a lot of the dad from dexter who he sees and talks to randomly. overall very good show if you have never watch dexter.",positive
"Binged this show in little under 2 weeks, and it's really a masterpiece. Would have rated this 9/10, which is the highest rating I give, but the last episode almost managed to break the entire show for me. I thought, it's an unwritten law that you don't do what they did there. I saw it, coming but convinced myself its impossible they write such a flawed cliché ending. Sadly I was wrong. Do yourself a favor and skip the last episode.",positive
It was an absolutly neecssity to treat the web security in general and that serie is just a must watch for every person who is not totally tech alergic. The characters are volontary not too much charismatic to stay credibles.,positive
"I tend to have this habit where, I'll experience something, and immediately claim to to be my ""new favorite thing"" or one of my favorites. Then slowly simmer down over time. And once I noticed that I began downplaying how I felt about certain works when I immediately saw them. But for this one, the emotional impact the ending has left on me and how amazing the entire show was I just can't do that. This is my favorite TV show of all time, and I can't think of a single piece of media that can top it. Not Breaking Bad, not Bojack Horseman, not one of the many videos games I've played. This is it, I've finally found something I can definitively call my favorite. And I couldn't feel any better.",positive
"Mr. Robot touches upon the sometimes revolting quirks and imperfections we have as the complex human species, and exposes it, leaving it in the stark nude. The story centers around Elliot, portrayed by Rami Malek, whom does a phenomenal job. He deviates the anti-social and awkward young adult extremely well and you feel so in touch with Elliot. You can't help but find yourself sympathizing and relating to Elliot whom is insecure due to obvious flaws, yet acts with such confident vigilance. This show explores the nooks and crannies we often subconsciously build in our minds as human beings. It brushes upon the often disgusting habits we build on the Internet and social media.",positive
"Brilliant finale!!At some point I during season three and early season four I thought that the whole series had lost its course and writers were lacking inspiration to continue the story, but oh boy little I knew what was waiting ahead. The way the different characters are introduced and the audience is steered back and forth along the story is just beautiful. I love series with an amazing plot twist. Mr Robot does this brilliantly. I now have double feelings wishing there were more seasons in the future, but on the other hand with this beautiful finale I kind of wish there won't to not ruin it.One of the best tv series I've seen in a while!",positive
"This is a masterpiece for tech concerned humanoids...
Technology depends on addicts, who has been the main inventors in this field of science... Ever...",positive
"Some reviewers are so hung up on a story alone and they bashes what they see. Mr.robot is an exception. I am not implying that Mr.Robot lost it's story, it's some critics/viewers simply have no understanding/patience to follow how does story evolves into something bigger than just being a very good black hat.In that sense, Mr.Robot makes viewers constantly thrill in it's on unique way. Everything about Mr.Robot is topnotch and that must certainly includes choice of music, acting, story, characters, camera work and one of the best mise-en-scene we will ever see. No scenes are ever single dimensional. It only get's better season by seasons. Watch it with patient. Don't expect tasteless trill all along, instead sit back and enjoy the full spectrum of art of work. Ratings in IMDB never lies.",positive

"Sam Esmail's Mr. Robot is airily tormenting, creepy and thought pricking. It's a psychological thrill'. Perhaps finally we will get to grips with the kinds of mental conditions that Cyber Warriors (this is just another cool name for hackers) live with. Rami Malek, wide eyed with a soft speech rhythm, convincingly stars as Eliot Anderson, a cyber security engineer, who works for a company by the name of Allsafe. He suffers from a social anxiety disorder. Don't be fooled by his geek appearance, Eliot leads another life, that of a vigilante who in cyberspace fights to right the wrongs of the world by hacking bad guys and suing the information gathered against them. It was Paul Virilio who, in the last decades of the last century, pointed out that the next currency is information, actually he equated it to energy – information energy. So perhaps we should know start to think of privacy as something hovering around extinction. It will really be interesting to see what Mr. Robot the series has in stores for us. We are watching.",negative
This show is one of those pretentious shows which makes you feel it is intelligent because you can't figure out what's actually going on in this show.,negative

"It all begins with a cautionary voice. A voice that invites you to listen to his reality and introduces you as the imaginary audience. That you, whoever is listening will come face to face with THE truth of your own existence. Although that voice insists that you are merely a figment of his imagination, who's to say that he's actually sane. Welcome to a blurry, tech savvy-filled thriller drama that is Mr. Robot. Where reality is not a question of who, but a question of being one. Where the imaginary is not a question of what, but is answered to be as our preconditioned ideas of the human condition. The endgame of it all, the fruit of all these manipulated narratives will leave you right back to first few lines of Elliot, ""Hello friend. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head"". And ultimately realize. In this world ran by Capitalism, ARE YOU REAL?",positive
"Mr. Robot is a captivating story about a young man with social anxiety disorder. He's a hacker, has a day job, visits a psychiatrist and incredibly intelligent. As most people he finds that being alone is a heavy burden to bear and tries reaching out to people which proves tough due to his condition. The show captivates the viewer easily at first and has just the right amount of background story, action & drama.Mr. Robot has it all. The creators of this show seemingly put a lot of time and effort into the story rather than the visual effects and the acting has a genuine feel to it.If the viewer knows a thing or two about programming/networking this show is likely to become a new favorite.",positive
Slow moving. just confusing.. nothing,negative
"A 20 century, character driven drama. Every single character in the series is unique and deeply presented to the viewer. The show is totally unpredictable and very character driven. The acting is great and the story is rich. Without a doubt it is high quality television. The only downside is the very high climactic and story wrapping ending, which makes us wonder what season 2 will be based around. We can hope it wont be just a calm after the storm season. Definitely worth watching, gets you hooked after 1 episode, which is the trademark of a good TV show. I gave it 8 out of 9, because 10 always seems too fan boyish. Unless its Game of thrones, of course.",positive
"Though the series has a good plot, even Before the end of the First chapter, I knew Mr. Robot was a modern version of Tyler durden.",negative
"This show is a commentary on a view of society. Yet it is following a story of a character and his life. People take the realism of the show to realistic and cant separate it from real world to TV world. Once separated you can see the idea of this show is not about cooperate evil, or the top 1% of 1%, but is about something every person can relate too... A relationship between a son and a father. Now who can't relate to that? You may not be a hacker, a anarchist but we all are sons and daughters and when a show can make you feel that again, its a show worth watching and after episode 6 season 2 that is done expertly.If not watch, relate and enjoy the show.",positive

Yeah not all that I'm afraid. Was on my phone and it was adequate background noise,negative
"I just started watching season 1 a couple weeks ago and am through season 2 already. With the exception of what I'll discuss below, the show is very good. The acting is good, story is great (episodes discussed below excluded)...it keeps you wanting to know what happens next. All that said, for some reason there is 1 episode per season (or large chunks of said episode) that left me feeling like I wasted my time. A perfect example of this is the first 20 min of season 2, episode 6 where Elliot, Darlene, Mr Robot and the mother are supposed to be a sitcom family going on a road trip / vacation; complete with background / Audience laughter. The entire portion of the episode is filmed while they are in a car, with the camera mounted on the hood, looking through the windshield with fake 'green screen' effects intended to portray the car in motion. This part of the episode is supposed to be Elliot creating an alternate reality in his head while he's getting the crap beat out of him. I cannot even give this an E for effort....It's a complete fail! Topped off with multiple cameo appearances by ALF. It was painful to watch and made me think that Sam Esmail was double dog dared to see if he could write and direct some of the worst television for the first part of an episode then see if he could do a 180 during the second half, leaving the audience with some of the best TV...good enough so the viewers totally forgot how bad the fist part was. Anyway, I will not go into the 'bad' episode in season 1 but you will know it when you see it...or after you get through 10-15 episodes you'll realize how bad a particular episode was.If not for these episodes, I would have given the series a solid 9/10 through the first 2 seasons.",positive
"the first season is amazing, they are all good actors, especially Rami Malek who really impressed me,i was completely focus on the entire season it was so good, i finished in 2 days and it was mind blowing in every single episode. but season 2 is just so boring, first episodes are not so bad but the rest of it... it got so dumb and repetitive, why so many episodes doing the same thing??? i didn't finished the season yet but i hope it gets good because right now feels like torture watch that.PS: not American here, so sorry if i wrote something wrong",positive
