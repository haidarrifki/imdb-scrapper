"A fascinating and powerful departure for Almodovar, or perhaps more accurately more an terrific hybrid of the best of his old and new. This has the darker, more actively perversely disturbing and violent themes of some of his early work like 'Matador' but shot and directed with the far smoother and more mature hand he has developed over the years. It also uses the more complex and fractured time structure style of Almodovar's more recent work, to great effect.In the end its a gorgeous looking, philosophically complex mystery and horror film. Although not gory, this is a disturbing work, both on a literal story level, and also for the questions it raises about identity, love, sado-masochism, and passion run amok.These themes are all Almodovar touchstones, but delivered here with a visually stunning icy touch, and with much more complete logic than in his early works, which often felt less fully thought through, and had more frustrating plot holes and character leaps. Not a 'scary' film, but a creepy, moody and highly effective one. A dark fairy tale as told by, say Stanley Kubrick. It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar, and he delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein. Less emotional than my two very favorite Almodovar films (Talk to Her, All About My Mother), but its exciting to see this extremely talented film maker continue to evolve and grow, and I think this represents work that can stand among his best.",positive
"I've never seen a Pedro Almodovar film before. I had been wanting to see this ever since I saw its premise. Very interesting, but it still surpassed my expectations.The film is unpredictable in it's pace. You never know what to expect next. It is hugely intriguing because of this. You can sense deeper and darker secrets are at the core of it all, but you don't know what. It becomes even more mysterious once it jumps back six years in time. There was a shot that convinced me what was really going on. It was a shot that mirrored two characters... well, that's all I am going to say. But when I saw that shot, I was convinced of what was going on underneath, and I was right. That doesn't mean it was predictable... not at all. Despite being sure of what was the twist, the film was still able to surprise me again and again. I want to take note that this really wouldn't be an easy film to pull off. In fact, on the surface, it's quite soapy, and on the hands of someone else, could have easily turned into a full-blown melodrama. It didn't and I am very glad of that. The icy cinematography and direction brilliantly keep us enthralled in a world in which anything is possible. It feels like science-fiction and horror blended with real grounded drama. I also want to take note of the performances. Being Mexican and having been raised of full-Mexican parents, I knew who Banderas was, but I never knew he could act this well. He never makes his character easy to figure out, and there's always a sense of empathy that we have with him, but should we? Who is the victim here? Elena Anaya is the star though. She has incredibly expressive and emotional eyes, and from the start we sense something underneath her. This is an incredible performance, one of the best supporting performances of the year. The ending was sort of abrupt though.All in all, I loved this film. Completely intriguing, hugely entertaining, very mysterious and gleefully thrilling without becoming a melodrama and feels very mature. Oh, and did I mention that the music score is fantastic!",negative
"Pedro Almodovar is not a conventional filmmaker by any means. His films openly explore subjects many acclaimed directors fear to tread and absorb in their whole entire careers, but what is always guaranteed with Almodovar is a sense of wonderment and the unexpected, and 'The Skin I Live In' ('La piel que habito') is no different. Based briefly on Thierry Jonquet's 2003 novel 'Mygale,' Almodovar's latest film is a delightful and refreshing combination of multiple genres including drama, thriller and body horror. It's shockingly sincere, beautifully horrifying and has an appeal that will keep the audiences eyes locked towards the events on-screen until the final credits roll.Dr Robert Lesgard (Antonio Banderas) is a renowned surgeon who is attempting to achieve a breakthrough in bio-medical sciences by creating a synthetic skin through transgenisis. Classified as a horrific mutation by some, and acknowledged by Robert as an innovation, his experiments come at a price. His human test subject is a beautiful woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) who is contained within his home, and cared for by his head servant Marilia (Marisa Paredes). Vera is not like other women, she wears a skin-coloured suit made out of fabric instead of clothes, she is constantly watched by Robert and Marilia, and she never leaves her room, which only Robert himself holds the key too. What follows is a startling journey of discovery as the narrative unravels a story of disturbing past, present and future events; transforming the lives of all those involved.Beginning in Toldeo in 2012, Almodovar utilizes a constantly underused and under-appreciated device in the nonlinear narrative. He provides the audience with one perception of each character before returning in flashback during the second act to six years previously where further events are explained and through this, the audience's initial observations of the characters become undermined and drastically altered. He then digresses between past and present at will building a comprehensive picture of each character involved as the story develops revealing some startling and disturbing discoveries. This decision to structure the film in this way, also adequately supplements Almodovar's need to explore his key themes including sexual identity, and the nature of the moral of ethics of the human soul after it has been literally stripped bare.Coupled with the beautiful cinematography from Almodovar's long-time collaborator Jose Luis Alcaine and an original and complimentary score by Alberto Iglesias, 'The Skin I Live In' also becomes an example of technically proficient filmmaking which works alongside the performances of the likes of Banderas and Anaya, as well as the slickly written script which keeps the audience on their toes until the final curtain has been dropped. Pedro Almodovar is undoubtedly one of the most successful auteurs of the last few decades, and with 'The Skin I Live In' he shows that he can almost touch upon a new genre, in the form of body horror genre-hybrid, whilst also retaining all the previous elements, themes and techniques which have made his films the deep-seated critically successful films that they are.",positive
"Nice Almodóvar film revolving around a a nutty doctor (Antonio Banderas) who creates a type of synthetic skin and attempts to remake the bruised body of beloved beings , then , he kidnaps people . Moody terror movie about a mad doctor , assisted by a maid (Marisa Paredes) , removes the structure of a gorgeous women and attempts to graft her skin onto her body . His guinea pig results to be a brave and rebel girl (Elena Anaya) , but this patient is very closely linked to dramatic deeds from past he would like to forget , then things go wrong .
Austerily wonderful mysterious film that contains intense drama , thrills , chills , and haunting poetic fantasy . In this enjoyable as well as eerie flick , Almodóvar established again his uniquely poetic and visually striking style , though imitating to classy ""Eyes Without A Face"" (1960) , the masterpiece directed by George Franju . This is a similar story but revisited by Pedro with his ordinary roles and situations , including rape , kink sex , strong love scenes and marvelous actresses . This splendid Spanish production is generally characterized by unforgettable images that owed a great deal to early cinema in general . Engaging and twisted script Pedro Almodóvar based on Thierry Jonquet's novel . Pedro worked on the script for almost a decade, and what initially was a retelling ended up being more of an inspired tale . The story is not massively strong , but it is not bad either , as Almodóvar strings a few o different threads together and that , along with tension and skin going on throughout tends to ensure the movie is always interesting and thrilling . The music by Oscar winner Alberto Iglesias , Almodovar's regular , is good in which it fits the style and feeling of the film . Luxurious and colorful cinematography by the prestigious José Luis Alcaine .The cast is also standout element of the film , as Pedro recasts Banderas in the character of unsettling doctor . Antonio Banderas is brilliant as a disturbing researcher/scientific/surgeon haunted by past tragedy who takes people removing their faces and attempts to graft them new skins . Support cast is frankly good , such as : Roberto Álamo , Eduard Fernández , Barbara Lennie , José Luis Gómez , Jan Cornet , Blanca Suárez , Susi Sánchez , Fernando Cayo . And brief appearance , as usual , by Agustin Almodóvar , Pedro's brother and film producer .
.
This issue about a doctor who attempts to remake the bruised face of intimate people has been treated several times in the European cinema , such as : ¨Eyes without a face¨ (1960) by George Franju , ¨The windmill of the stone women¨ by Giorgo Ferroni . And especially by the prolific writer/producer/director Jesús Franco who shot : The Awful Dr. Orlof (1962) deemed to be the first movie of the ¨Spanish Fantaterror¨ and following a long series as El Secreto del Dr. Orloff (1964) aka ""The Mistresses of Dr. Jekyll"" - USA . It's gone on by "" Orloff y el hombre invisible (1970) aka ""Dr. Orloff's Invisible Monster"" , ¨Ojos siniestros de Doctor Orloff¨(1973) . Furthermore , El enigma Del Ataúd (1969) aka ""Only a Coffin"" and El Siniestro doctor Orloff (1984) aka ""The Sinister Dr. Orloff . Finally in ¨Faceless¨ or Depredadores de Noche¨(1987) .",positive
"Pedro Almodovar has created a daring and entirely unique masterpiece, a word that I do not use lightly or often. The Skin I Live In has a lot that of aspects that feel very Almodovar, but there's also a lot of Cronenberg here as well, and with the latter being my favorite director it's no surprise that I fell in love with it quickly. The film is a startling, wild study into a world of obsession, revenge and the complexities of the human flesh. Almodovar has really outdone himself here, crafting a tale of wicked intensity and rarely met eccentricity.The structure here is one of it's more interesting aspects and yet another film this year that isn't told in a strictly linear fashion. We first meet Doctor Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) in the present day, as he works tirelessly on perfecting a new skin for his subject, the young and beautiful Vera (Elena Anaya). Almodovar establishes us in this present day world, complete with a very Almodovar subplot (a man in a tiger suit comes to the house and brings some trouble) and a lot of baggage for Ledgard. We get to know these people, become intrigued by what brought them to their current state and that we jump back six years to explore this character further.It's a surprising jump and I must admit that it got me off guard at first, but as we spend more and more time in the past building up to the present I slowly came to terms with what Almodovar was doing. He gave us a stake in the present day world so that when he took us into the past it becomes about more than just laying out the facts. We already have a perception on Ledgard and a curiosity into understanding the events that bring him to where we met him, so the film becomes as much of a fascinating game of putting these puzzle pieces together as it is a character study and all-around masterwork of high drama.Slowly the pieces start to come together and I found myself constantly trying to figure out what happened in this world, how these events in the past connect to the present day we were introduced to. When we finally get our answer...stunned...amazed...jaw-unhinged...none of these words can even begin to describe what happened to my mind. This is a twist that doesn't exist for shock value by any means but absolutely sent me to the floor, one of the most shocking and unexpected moves in cinema history as far as I'm concerned. It threw me for a major loop and everything I had come to perceive about these characters and their world was altered in an instant. Everything became a thousand times more fascinating and complex with the use of one simple word.As I said before, this is a piece of the most miraculous and bold high-drama, a world where anything is possible but nothing feels out of place. That is perhaps the most shocking aspect of the film itself, that Almodovar gives us a story filled to the brim with melodrama but none of it feels contrived or too weird or too much. Everything feels totally natural and believable in the world that Almodovar establishes for us. His ability to make this happen is nothing short of extraordinary. Of course he doesn't do it alone and there are a lot of other aspects to the film that contribute to making it work on every conceivable level, to bring us into this incredible world.Of course there are the performances, which are just a dream on their own. I've never been a fan of Antonio Banderas and I've honestly been hesitant to watch films just based on his involvement, but he delivers something here that I never knew he was capable of. Ledgard is an incredibly difficult character to pull off because our perception of him changes drastically throughout the film, but Banderas masters it without a single hitch. There was never a false move, never a moment where I didn't believe this character was capable of doing what he was doing. He is charming, intelligent, deranged and intimidating, unfolding layer after layer as we go on. It's a remarkable achievement in both character and performance. The other performances work very well to support Banderas and Almodovar's work here, particularly from the absolutely gorgeous Elena Anaya. She is all things sympathetic, manic, intriguing and sensual and when we come back to the present day after understanding what brought her to this place, she takes on a whole new life of internal chaos and complexity. For all of her outward expression it becomes a very internal performance and she is sensational here.The technical aspects are all on key, all of them impressing without taking the spotlight away from the story, but the one thing that really left a mark was the phenomenal score. If it wasn't for Hanna, this score would be a runaway victory for my personal win right now. Rarely have I seen music so well-utilized for the atmosphere a director strives to establish. The high-wire drama meets it's ally with this music, a soaring operatic work that brings us into this world so completely. It swept me away and completely engulfed me in this world that Almodovar established. The score is a perfect fit for the film because it captures exactly what the overall product is; a brilliant and original opera of miraculous proportions. This is one of those films that I wasn't expecting a lot from and it just blew me away at every level.",positive
"As a longtime fan of Pedro Almodovar's films, I will admit the trailer for his latest film The Skin I Live In left me somewhat baffled. Having now seen the film however, I see the method in his madness. The trailer tells you little or nothing about the film but bombards the viewer with crazy images which are in retrospect probably designed to confuse. The trailer serves the purpose of telling the viewer very little of what the film is about while titillating with striking visuals. A bold move but an effective one, because the less you know about this film going in the better.With that in mind, I'll keep this review short and will try not to give anything away. Antonio Banderas plays a rather unhinged scientist who is keeping a beautiful young woman prisoner in his home while using her as a human guinea pig for a new type of synthetic human skin. That's about as much information as you need. As the story unfolds, petal by petal in that flower-like way we've become accustomed to seeing from Almodovar, each scene adds wonder and flavour to an already robust set-up. Moving at a break-neck pace, not a frame is without beauty and not a second is wasted without pushing the story along. This screenplay is extremely polished and beautifully nuanced.As usual, cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine delivers beautifully vibrant visuals, but unlike other Almodovar films, this palette is decidedly less colourful, sticking mainly to Cronenbergian metallic colours fused with fleshy tones but with the odd gash of vibrant colour. It is as beautiful to behold as any other Almodovar film, but perhaps less garish.In a film that relies on ambiguity in so many ways the cast here must be commended. Delicate balances are achieved by all concerned and it's wonderful to see Antonio Banderas settling into the rather unsettling role of Dr. Robert Ledgard. He exudes the same charisma and sexual bravura that made him famous but without the least whiff of sex symbol status coming through in the performance. He is creepy, strangely alluring and underplays the ""mad scientist"" bit admirably. Elena Anayas also impresses in a very challenging performance both physically and emotionally, both of which are perfectly effective as her story unfolds. A brilliant character who may not have been so impressive in the hands of a less capable actress. The camera intimately caresses her face and body throughout and she steadfastly rises to the challenge of being as beautiful a muse as a director could ask for.It is unlikely that Almodovar will win over any new fans with The Skin I Live In but he will surely satisfy his already massive fanbase. A dark, thoughtful, frightening piece but never shying away from the heights of melodrama that Almodovar is known for, this sits beautifully on the line between Cronenberg at his best and a crazy soap opera.Unique, Gothic and delightfully melodramatic! I love it!http://charlenefilmblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/skin-i-live-in.html",positive
"In Toledo, the scientist and surgeon Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) is researching a synthetic skin capable to resist fire and any harm after the death of his beloved wife, who was burnt in a car accident. He is isolated in his mansion with his maid Marilia (Marisa Paredes) and his mysterious subject Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya), who is testing his experiment but is locked in her room.After the assault of the thug Zeca (Roberto Álamo), who raped Vera, Robert has a nightmare with his daughter Norma (Blanca Suárez), who was raped in a party by the youngster Vicente (Jan Cornet) and committed suicide later. Robert plots a scheme to revenge his daughter that has begun with the abduction of Vicente. What is the connection between Vicente and Vera?""La Piel que Habito"" is an intriguing and dark film of revenge and obsession by Pedro Almodóvar that recalls George Franju's ""Les Yeux Sans Visage"" (""Eyes without a Face"") but in a David Cronenberg's style.It was very difficult for me to write the plot summary without spoilers since the screenplay is very well developed like a puzzle and the mystery is kept along most part of the story. The gorgeous Elena Anaya has a great performance in her ambiguous role. Antonio Banderas and Marisa Paredes are wonderful, as usual. Ending my review, I would like to write that even those viewers that have never seen a film by Almodóvar will enjoy ""La Piel que Habito"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Pele que Habito"" (""The Skin I Live in"")",positive
"The Skin I Live In (La Piel Que Habito, 2:00, R) — other: drama, 3rd string, originalSpanish director Pedro Almodóvar has a just reputation for taking women seriously in his films. His latest effort (as usual in Spanish with English subtitles) is no exception, even tho he gives most of the screen time to his most accomplished discovery and frequent star, Antonio Banderas (seemingly one of the few Hispanic actors whom Americans will tolerate in a lead role), playing the brilliant and innovative plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard. This is a deadly serious role, in marked contrast to Banderas's other current star turn as the voice of Puss in Boots.The female lead, Elena Anaya, plays Vera Cruz (yes), Ledgard's stunningly gorgeous patient, experimental subject, apparent captive, and  well, here Almodóvar (who co-wrote the screenplay with brother Agustín) gets a bit coy. Is she a manikin, an Eliza Doolittle to Ledgard's Henry Higgins, a Sabina Spielrein to his Carl Jung, possibly a creature to his Frankenstein? Or maybe none of the above? We know only that she seems devoted to him, tho he is unresponsive to her charms.Vera is confined to the big bedroom, elegantly furnished, where she does her yoga exercises dressed in a flesh-colored body stocking. Ledgard has the only key to the room, and he always keeps her locked in. He himself stays in the smaller bedroom next door, where he watches her intently on a wall-sized video screen. All her food and other needs are delivered from the kitchen via a dumbwaiter, and she communicates with only 2 people: Robert in person, and the housekeeper via intercom.Ledgard is a widower, and we see in flashback that his wife Gal suffered a terrible car accident and fire, leaving her horribly disfigured even after Robert's virtuoso surgical work and devoted care. But even after all his efforts, Gal is unable to stand her pain, weakness, and ugliness, and she commits suicide. Unfortunately, it's right in front of their tweenage dotter Norma (Blanca Suárez), who is driven into hysterics and a nervous breakdown by the sight.Ledgard, as one of the world's leading reconstructive surgeons, does not lack for cash, so he devotes the next several years to his twin obsessions, coaxing his dotter back from the precipice of madness and developing a graftable artificial skin, which he somewhat ghoulishly dubs Gal, a combination of human and pig genes that's highly resistant to burns, cuts, and punctures. Such an epidermis would have saved his beloved wife, he reasons, and this alone justifies his transgressing the ethical boundaries against transgenics. (This is the only science-fictional element in the film, and it's not much of a stretch from what modern medicine is actually capable of doing, which is why I categorize it as essentially a psychodrama.)There are 3 other characters of note: Ledgard's housekeeper Marilia (Marisa Paredes), an older woman with secrets of her own; her wastrel son Zeca (Roberto Álamo), who pays an unwelcome visit; and studly young Vicente (Jan Cornet), son of and apprentice to the local dressmaker, who takes a shine to now-teenage Norma as she shyly tries to work her way back into normal society.We learn most of the above during the first half hour, which leaves us wondering just what on Earth is going on here. The remainder of the film slowly pulls aside one curtain after another to fill us in. And that is all I will say on the subject. You'll have to see the rest for yourself.And you should.",positive
"""The Skin I Live In"" is, like most films by the Spanish director a film that cannot be pitched or explained in a few sentences. I am reminded of his superb work in ""Talk to her"" and ""All about my mother"". ""Talk to her"" was a love story between a woman in a coma and her rapist while Mother was a film about a nun with AIDS, a transvestite with a hearth of gold and a woman searching for her son's heart. In one sentence Almodovar's films all sound twisted at best. But in the hands of a master they are beautiful works of art. Same goes for ""The Skin I Live In"". In a sentence (like many who haven't watched the film are quick to point out) the film sounds creepy at best and deals with a plot that makes most uncomfortable.A plastic surgeon (Banderas) belongs to family straight out of Pasolini's Salo. He keeps a beautiful woman (Anaya) as a guinea pig and he tries to create a new kind of skin. But Anaya's character, in what seems the major metaphor of the film, preserves her inner persona intact regardless of what happens to her body. As in most of Almodovar's films the layers become more complex as the movie evolves and towards the end of the film there's a plot twist only Freud could have come up with.Without spoilers I would like to point out that the director seems to use horror as a channel to explore the violation of every moral code embodied by the characters. With a magnificent score by Alberto Iglesias, Almodovar tries for a difficult genre and it pays off. The set design and cinematography, as always with Pedro's films is superb. At Canes the reception of the film was mixed an I can understand why. It simply isn't an easy movie to watch. For those who don't seem to have a problem with American horror movies where teens are stalked, raped and cut into little pieces by a chainsaw but are horrified by ""The Skin I live In"" I have a suggestion: Let's remember that fiction is indeed the only place when one can deal with horror and gore as metaphors for our human flaws, a place where we don't have to hide from our demons but we get to talk to them, a place where sickness gets no one hurt... Like Hitchcock used to say: It is only a movie, dear.",positive
"The Skin I Live In is really a film that should be seen by a very big audience, obviously it's a movie that probably doesn't appeal to a very big crowd, it appeals to an older crowd or a young hipster type crowd who enjoy foreign films. I have read the novella Tarantula that this is supposedly loosely based on, however I found that it followed the novel extremely closely, I thought a lot of the twists and stuff that were in the book would be taken out if the film but thankfully most are present and accounted for.Antonio Banderas is so terrific as the leading man, he hasn't looked this great in screen in a long time, I think he seems more at home in his native language, and Elena Anaya is absolutely radiant on the big screen, her face just lights up the screen and she is absolutely exceptional in a very strange role. The story is really a bizarre one, it's seems like a less perverted De Sade and a more understandable David Lynch, it always takes you by surprise and it is highly original and also somewhat daring I think, and thank god a director like Almodovar decided to film it and not some silly director.The cinematography and music is beautiful, the colours and textures in the film are picked up beautifully by the camera and the music is a great companion to each scene, it's so close to perfection in the production design department that i would go so far to say as I haven't seen a better looking film this year. This movie is in my opinion the least accessible of all of Almodovar's films but I hope it doesn't put people off, as his touch and style is clear and present here. It's very different, strange, perverted, horrific, beautiful and always entertaining.Enjoy :)",positive
"Maybe this works as a black comedy but I doubt that was the intention. Antonio Bandaras sleep walks through the lead role.The story jumps around through time. For a while it works and can be taken seriously until the brother who he doesn't know is a brother arrives dressed as the LSU tiger because he can only go out in costume...don't ask.Outstanding art direction and set design are about the only positive in this trashy mess. At one point guns hidden in every drawer, rather then foreshadow and create suspense, seem funny.Women are poorly treated. In Todd Browning's ""Freaks"" the most horrible thing was to turn the bad guy into a giant chicken, here it's give him a vagina. The movie will not get a wide distribution. Consider yourself lucky if it doesn't come to a theater near you.",negative
"Pedro Almodovar has brought his famous visual flair and panache to perfection in La piel que habito. Few directors have such a distinct style as Almodovar. Bright colours, carefully designed sets, beautiful people in weird, over-the-top situations, unconventional relationships, and a sense for detail worthy of a true perfectionist. It's all there in this film, and better than ever. The story is intriguing enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, with some crazy twists that only Almodovar can come up with. The cinematography is excellent, with some scenes that are pure visual poetry. Make sure to enjoy the scene where Vera tears her dresses apart and removes the pieces with a vacuum cleaner, or the way Almodovar films the murder scene with the camera looking down from the ceiling, or the close-up of Vera's feet wriggling in the black skin-tight socks. There's so much to admire and enjoy. The film stars Antonio Banderas, who renews his cooperation with Almodovar: the last time the two worked together was in Atame from 1990. Banderas is a rich surgeon who has developed a new sort of artificial skin, and turns out to be a creep who thinks he has the right to literally mold people to his taste and preferences. Banderas plays this man in a properly emotionless way. The very demanding role of Vera is played by Elena Anaya, of 'Lucia y el sexo'-fame, who also played a part in Almodovar's 'Hable con ella'.In some reviews this film is called a horror-movie. That's a very misleading description. There are hardly any horror elements, there even is very little blood. The only way to describe it, is as a typical Almodovar-movie. This director has created a genre of his own.",positive
"Only a true genius can make one film after another and somehow manage to shock and awe the audience each and every time with his unique talent to transform the deepest darkest subjects of fantasies we could possibly imagine into not only art but into sheer beauty and a total masterpiece. If you want to see a provocative beautifully directed film that keeps you guessing while glued to the seat then this a film for you. If you are a narrow minded prude then you probably will get nightmares from watching this.I can never get enough of Almodovar's films, they are as addictive as they are unique.",positive
"In his latest film Almodóvar takes a qualitative jump into new philosophical depths. His usual reflections on the nature of relationships and the consequence of one's actions take on a well- defined shape and advance forward with self-assurance.The order in which the events of the story are told is a cunning device that allows the director to make us reflect on how superficially - indeed, skin-deep - we perceive reality and how quick we are to judge first impressions and jump to conclusions. What we first perceive one way, those initial scenes that slightly baffle us but which we nevertheless do not hesitate to judge in a specific way, take on a completely new meaning when the story pauses to take us back into the past in order to tell us about an important series of events that happened at the time which bear a direct relation to present events. The new light that is shed on the present changes completely our perception of the story as we had first witnessed it, which is a humbling experience. We are then taken back again to the present and continue watching the rest of the film, but with this completely new understanding of the real underlying motivations for the characters' actions. It is at this point that through a slight thriller-style twist in the plot the story takes on a Shakespearean dimension as it delivers its powerful humanist lesson that vengeance begets vengeance.Food for thought, in fact enough food to last you days and feed other people, as you are left on the one hand wondering at the concept of skin: what we actually desire when we desire someone, whether all desire is skin-deep, whether the skin does not allow us to see the person behind. And on the other hand you are left with the reflection on how the road of vengeance leads only to self-destruction. When a film leaves you pondering so deeply, I can only conclude it is a great film.",positive
This movie is beyond my expectation with unexpected twists and turns. Who ever thought of making this kind of movie:? Taking revenge through making it scientific project.:3.,positive
"You might find this flaming bag of dog droppings in your local RedBox.Avoid it like the plague.The plot is that we find a crazy doctor is locking up a woman and using her as a test subject to some whacky artificial skin he's developing.I'll warn you off now. We find out the hot girl is really a punk who was kidnapped by the crazy doctor, given a vaginoplasty, and then slowly converted into a woman... We aren't told that until the middle of the movie, which makes the sex scenes in the beginning of the movie a lot ickier....(Although they were still pretty Icky to start with.) The problem is, I don't know which characters I'm supposed to be rooting for here. The punk/girl is a rapist, the doctor is crazy, none of the characters are the least bit likable.",negative
"Banderas plays Robert Ledgard, a plastic surgeon wizard who loses his wife and later his only child who commits suicide after being raped. He turns his skills against the rapist and transforms the man physically into his former wife.If you get a tad confused over that last sentence, you have just experienced La piel que habito; a farce of a movie if there ever was one. The premise of the film is so stupifyingly asinine that consequently the whole movie becomes completely unwatchable. This is mainly the case because at no point the movie actually admits it is a comedy. However, the movie is a belter were it not for the lack of a complimentary screenplay for this type of film. What remains is a 2 hour long head-scratcher that only succeeds in insulting the intelligence of the average moviegoer who is left adrift to find some redemption over the time and money invested in this flick while aside from some brief nudity, there is none on offer. The screenplay for the film would probably been in better hands if the Coen brothers had written it. Perhaps they will attempt to do a remake in which Jeff Bridges transforms George Clooney into Frances McDormand. They would probably get away with it too.3/10",negative
"Almodovar, for me, is a talented director who makes hits and misses. 'Talk to Her', I believe, is his best film to date; there are a couple of contenders for his worst. But 'The Skin I Live In' definitely isn't one of them.It is an art-house horror thriller, adapted from Thierry Jonquet's novel 'Tarantula' (unread by me). The obvious source of inspiration is the French film 'Les Yeux Sans Visage', another horror film involving a mad doctor and synthetic skin. But 'The Skin I Live In' is far more than that. I won't give any details of the plot anyway, but perhaps think about that title more carefully.When I say it is an art-house horror film - it is definitely Almodovar's own brand of 'art'. He fills his screen with deep, rich, gaudy colours - reds, blues, yellows, browns, oranges - and the disquieting, rosy shade of cream that belongs to the synthetic skin of the title. It is a visual feast.The plot is ridiculous and somewhat trashy, but it hangs tightly together, and Almodovar has cast aside horror conventions and clichés and made something quite original. Antonio Banderas impresses in the lead as the vengeful surgeon, and the film, becoming evermore twisted as Banderas' true motives for the experiment and its full extents become clearer, is very entertaining. People left the cinema as the end credits began to roll, laughing - not in derision, but in shock.I wonder if this will have an American remake. I can see it happening, but I hope it doesn't. Almodovar has put his own unique stamp on this, incorporating at successive turns tongue in cheek humour, disturbing brutality, psychological torture and bizarre moments of poignancy. I suppose the best compliment that can be given to the film, with this in mind, is that it works.It is no masterpiece. It is very well acted, very well made with an interesting and pleasing aesthetic, with sharp prickles of fear and a genuinely surprising twist. It is an entertaining guilty pleasure from Almodovar. I await his next film with interest.",negative
"The credits are rolling as I type this, and my opinion may change upon further meditation, but at the present moment, I cannot think of a better film I've seen in my entire life.This film is equal parts ""The Piano Teacher"" and ""Serbian Film."" It is deeply unsettling, profound, and beautifully executed.I have to admit that my expectations were lowered by Antonio Banderas' involvement and the plot (allegedly) involving a surgeon trying to do something or other. It sounded like a tame, modern, artsy reinvention of ""Eyes Without A Face."" I suppose that film is a part of its heritage, but The Skin I Live In is much more engaging and unsettling.I'm not going to take the time to organize my thoughts into a proper five-paragraph format. If you like disturbing stuff, and / or if you are a film snob, this is top-shelf. There's really nothing better out there.",positive
"If you skip a few obvious things on obsession, this is worthwhile essaying by Almodovar. Three plates made to spin here.One is sexual, deception obviously layered first and teasing throughout. We imagine a sexual fantasy at first encounter, but that is soon recast with increasing pain and nightmare.Another is cinematic, referencing our film and viewer dynamics. The doctor styles an image to be as he once knew, and shares life with it from the other side of a screen. It is a sublime rendition of cinematic space that we share into from our end as viewers. From her end, Vera agrees to be the play actor in this triple-shared fantasy but seems to be deriving strength from somewhere else.That is our third layer here, yoga contemplating a true face. So far from our perspective the effort was for beauty, artificial harmony; but now from inside we have increasing pain and madness. At some point she discovers yoga, one of many things she has picked up from TV.Now yoga as has come to be known through Patanjali is a post-Buddhist adoption. In the West it has been reduced to healthy exercise with some flavor from distant lotus, its essence though is formless meditation in form. The body becoming elastic and radiant is only an after-effect of a balanced, aware mind.The idea of course is that every cosmologic stance found in yoga reflects a contemplative state of mind. And as we begin to grow, we understand that this is not an idea at all, and that a state of mind is a thing you practice, the thing in itself, so that you no longer reflect what you know but embody what the world has always been.Yoga (meaning 'connection' but also 'performance') is our bounding chord here. Centered in pure elasticity of form, having felt how a face can be bent, altered, shaped, how matter is performed, and so that it's a ceaseless, ever-changing universe that we are encased by, the yogic wisdom would be a realization of pure consciousness as the true face. That man would be forgiven for his folly, the universe made peace with for what it conspired, this body embraced as no more 'mine' or 'I' as the one before knowing it will wither just the same.Not here. That option would alienate many, would seem far-fetched or even perverse, and people just don't like to hear some things can be escaped. We are reassured that what we call a 'self' is a fixed, unchanging quality.But having set these three plates spinning, one that is so close to a sexual fantasy it risks being misrepresented as crassness, one about spirituality that not many will deign to even consider, and one about cinema that many will pick up but not necessarily in light of the other two, I maintain that very few filmmakers could set them spinning in the same time, and would require wisdom and masterful method. Almodovar shows only some of both and the whole slips from his hands at the last moment.There is reconciliation ahead of Vera we're finally shown, new love that he used to fantasize about but now can earnestly pour himself into, no more fantasies, having been the object of one. That is fine, but only resolves two of the layers.This is important to comment on. We get to note the different yogic stages all through the film - mind states, not physical posture - save for the last one, what in meditation is known as 'samadhi'. Nothing on that. Was finally the object of meditation love or violence? And does he merge with it, whichever of the two?",negative
"Georges Franju's sci-fi horror classic ""Eyes without a Face"" was overdue for a remake with updated cosmetic surgery and stem cell technologies and, seeing as how these days the Spanish are making the art-house flicks that the French used to be so good at, it's fitting that Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has remade that film in his own wacky Almodóvar way. Familiar motifs such as the narrative posing in flashback form, family skeleton secrets falling out of closets and reconciliations between mothers and children flesh out the original ""Eyes "" plot and break every known moral convention to explore issues about identity, especially identity based on superficial criteria such as facial appearance and beauty, and stereotypes about gender.Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) is a brilliant plastic surgeon whose wife was disfigured in a fire when her car caught alight. Although he saves the wife's life and repairs what damage has been done to her face, she later kills herself by defenestration in front of their daughter Norma. Norma becomes psychotic and stays that way for years until doctors judge her well enough to attend a wedding and its reception with her father. The girl meets Vicente (Jan Cornet) and the two sneak off into the garden for a pash. While making out, Norma hears the wedding singer warbling the song that had been playing when her mother threw herself out the window and the girl has a severe reaction. Vicente, frightened, runs away and Ledgard, searching for Norma, finds her catatonic in the garden. With the girl regressing permanently to her psychotic state, Ledgard hunts down Vicente, imprisons him and subjects him to a series of cosmetic surgery operations that include castration, a sex change and other changes: the result is the lovely Vera (Elena Anaya) who becomes the focus for Ledgard's obsessive desires and manias.The script is skilfully written and proceeds at a fast pace yet by using a narrative structure of a series of introductions followed by flashback history, it sets before viewers a bunch of characters of whom we form first-impression opinions; all of these impressions are undermined by the film's second half which takes the form of memories seen through Ledgard and Vera's dreams. We begin to understand the true horror of Vera's experience at the hands of Ledgard who experiments on her as much out of curiosity and thirst for career fame and advancement of scientific knowledge as for vengeance. There could have been some very instructive lessons delivered about the seductive nature of scientific inquiry and how it can blind people to issues of ethical responsibility, exploitation of subjects (especially human subjects) and abusing their freedom and rights, and about the nature of freedom itself: can a person experience freedom and individuality even while imprisoned in an unwanted body and sexual identity and surrounded by another beautiful prison layer (Ledgard's palatial home)? We see Vera educate herself with yoga and art while trapped in her beautiful jail; would Vicente have become a more educated person if he had not been captured and tormented the way he has been? Who is actually more free, Vera or Ledgard? – Vera believes herself the prisoner but Ledgard, in thrall to his obsessions and desire for vengeance, may actually be the less free of the two. But this movie being an Almodóvar movie, deep lessons about obsession, revenge and power and control over other people are avoided; we get instead a moderately convoluted story that piles shock upon shock and laugh upon laugh while the background reverberates with the invisible noise of shattering moral conventions and continuous breaches of audience tolerance.Visually the film is beautiful and, despite the use of muted blues and green, flamboyant in that distinctive Almodóvar way: there is an added clinical precision that wouldn't be out of place in a Cronenberg film, thanks to the subject matter and its treatment in the plot. Banderas does an excellent job as the quietly manic doctor / researcher who is as reasonable as a mad man can be, and Anaya acquits herself well as his victim. Maria Paredes as Ledgard's housekeeper (and secret biological mother) Marilia helps to keep the plot going smoothly. Minor characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs; even Vicente rarely rises from ardent young would-be lover and wronged prisoner.Ultimately though ""The Skin I Live In"" is more fussy and tricksy in its plot, focussing on ideas and themes about gender identity that Almodovar has always been interested in, than deep and moving about the subject matter and the issues thrown up that are unique to the film.",negative
"'The Skin I Live In' is a strange film from Pedro Amoldovar, a tale of sexual obsession and transformation which is, however, based on such a fundamentally extreme representation of human motivation (and a sci-fi expansion of the possibilities for human action) that it fails to convey an any emotional punch. As usual with Amoldovar films, it looks ravishing, yet a non- chronological approach to storytelling adds little to what is a fundamentally linear tale save for confusion and the illusion of depth. There are potentially interesting ideas in the film, but the treatment of most of them is cursory. Overall, the film seems to have little purpose save to delight in its own transgressions.",negative
"Dear lord.... after reading so many glowing reviews of this 'arthouse masterpiece', Pedro Almodóvar's oeuvre was to be honest slightly comical. I was expecting more than a pantomime, a French farce of a film, a Scooby Doo episode with rape scenes, but here it is. it is not shocking, horrific nor psychological, nothing on screen causes the slightest bit of tension due to the lack of character and because of the pretense of the piece to assume that 'I will love it because it's hip', frankly it rather annoyed me. Not a single character makes sense, scenes appear to be crow-barred into place so an extra piece of 10 minute narrative can be made, and most of the film would have been just as affective if it was told by a stranger around a camp-fire.. 'It was on a night like this' indeed... Banderas, whilst doing a great job, just doesn't make sense at all and has half a dozen changes of direction - Is he lonely? Is he evil? Is he a dirty old man? Hmmmm.. Juries out on that one. Still, at least the leading lady yet again catches her death in the name of narrative! And while Elena Anaya is painfully lovely and just about the only consistent role, the story is told with such pantomime it truly is difficult to feel the slightest bit sorry for her. This won a BAFTA? Really?! Is the viewing public that starved of entertainment that this was the best thing on offer? 'Martyrs' is horror. You want psychological thrillers, take your pick. Stop giving this man money! it only encourages him!",negative
"Anyone who knows Pedro Almodóvar's work should know that he portrays shocking things. ""La piel que habito"" (""The Skin I Live In"" in English) is par for the course. Antonio Banderas plays a plastic surgeon who has a muse, but there's more than meets the eye. Almodóvar uses the movie to explore some of humanity's most disturbing qualities and impulses; I once heard someone say of Almodóvar ""His movies depict what we think but don't say.""It's not a movie that you're likely to forget any time soon. One could call it a horror movie without gore, monsters, evil spirits, etc. Whatever you call it, I consider it a movie that everyone should see (of course, I've liked every Almodóvar movie, so I'm biased). Definitely watch it.",positive
"I think there is no director who has a better sense of space and color than Almodóvar and his talents in those areas are on display in this movie which is a slick variation on old horror films. Dr. Robert Ledgard, a surgeon and biologist, has suffered the loss of his wife to a fiery auto accident and he invents an artificial skin that is flame resistant. He uses his invention to mold a person to meet the personal goal of trying to recreate his wife. Is Ledgard not compatible in spirit with Victor Frankenstein?The story is convoluted, moving back and forth between past and present. There are a number of red herrings tossed in just to confuse. And there are scenes that seem to be in just because they appealed to Almodóvar and he did not know what to do with them, like two nightclub numbers performed by Concha Buika. Several topics are handled with almost clinical detachment, like cloning, growing skin, and surgery. This is not to say that the presentation is without fascination. The more I got to know Ledgard the less I cared for him, or about him. I could connect with poor Vincent, the unwilling victim of a sex change operation, but the contemplation of that makes for some uncomfortable reflections.This is the first I had seen Antonio Banderas and I thought he was well cast. He reminded me of some stars of previous generations, like Clark Gable. Elena Anaya did not get to be where she is on her beauty alone; she has an expressive face and a lithe body. When she was running around the house she had the grace and quick reflexes of a feral cat.Particularly impressive is the score which artfully enhanced the experience. I was expecting to see that much of the music was composed by someone of the stature of Shostakovitch or Ligeti, but no, it was the contemporary Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias. I salute him.I was able to appreciate the artistic flourishes but remained detached from the proceedings.",positive
"This film is mildly recommended.Pedro Almodovar's latest offering, The Skin I Live In, continues his directorial trademark of vivid primary colors and graphic patterns, interesting photographic perspectives, hyperbolic narratives that border on Telemundo soap opera excesses, and such flourish and visual élan that only enhance his unique personal style. This talented director heavily borrows from other inspirational sources like Hitchcock's Vertigo, a little known British film by William Wyler called The Collector, and classic literature like Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Although this time, Almodovar's film incorporates more horror and sci-fi elements into his mix of ongoing themes that are usually found in his body of work. His themes still boldly emphasize the sexual eroticism between men and women and the consequences of their actions. Only in The Skin I Live In, the execution is a bit heavy-handed and stylistically overdone in its melodramatic approach. It never seems to quite come together.Almodovar assembles his patchwork story to tell the tale of Dr. Robert Ledgard ( Antonio Banderas, in a demanding and challenging role), a famous plastic surgeon who seems to have come undone with the recent tragic death of his beautiful wife, the victim of a fiery car crash. Obsessed with perfecting a synthetic skin that can withstand any damage, Ledgrad soon focuses on a new patient at his private clinic, Vera Cruz ( Elena Anaya, alluring and effective ). Vera becomes his consuming passion, his crusade, and his substitute for his lost love. While his research continues and the good doctor makes scientific breakthroughs with resilient skin replacements, the medical establishment becomes horrified and question the ethics of such a process. So does his long-time housekeeper, Marilia ( Marisa Paredes ), and Vera herself.To say anymore about the plot could spoil the film's many twists and turns in a convoluted screenplay written by the director, a script that interweaves past and present events to fill out the mystery and the resulting tension of the doctor's fixation. The introduction of some minor characters and their collective scenes do nothing to augment the plot which seems a bit muddled in its editing structure as the film slowly unravels the mystery between the doctor and his patient. Major exposition of some of the characters' motives and necessary medical treatments remain unexplained and rather vague and illogical.Still, the film shows a darkly ominous view of compulsion and addiction in intriguing ways. Almodovar's depiction of sexual acts is again totally hypnotic and frank in its presentation and he directs his actors well enough to avoid embarrassment as the characters become more unpleasant and the film's plot becomes more ludicrous and outlandish with every new reveal.The Skin I Live In wants to be seen as a serious film about obsession, revenge, and the use of power to control the human condition. Yet underneath all of its surface treatment and glossy veneer, there remains a simplistic story that is in need of more depth, substance, and a little common sense.

"(*Attention!* - *Possible spoilers*) For obvious reasons I view ""The Skin I Live In"" as simply putting a new face (literally) on ""The Bride of Frankenstein"". (Well, sort of) In spite of its gaping plot holes and blatant inconsistencies (pay close attention to the color of Vincente's eyes), this modern-day ""Mad Scientist"" flick certainly did deliver a ""first"" when it came to its very clever, little, final plot twist.Set in Toledo, Spain, we meet the opium-smoking Dr. Robert Ledgard, who just so happens to be an outstanding, but, decidedly unethical, plastic surgeon, working in the specialized field of trans-genesis research.Through many years of study and experimentation, it seems that the doc has, in fact, cultivated and perfected a type of graftable skin that is soft and pliable, and, yet, can actually provide an indestructible shield against burns and insect bites.As one would expect in a mad scientist yarn such as this, Dr. Ledgard has a bitter, hateful grudge to bear and, so, in the name of vengeance, he uses his surgical expertise as a means to right a wrong that inevitably proves to us all that ""Two wrongs don't make a right."" (Ain't it the truth - Ain't it the truth!) At times a little slow-paced and confused, The Skin I Live In is, in the long run, well-worth a view.So, don't be fooled by pale imitations.Filmed in Spanish with English sub-titles.",negative
"""La Piel Que Habito (The Skin I Live In)"" is a Spanish 2011 horror drama directed by Pedro Almodóvar starring Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya.
⚪
All in all, this grotesque Almodóvar feature creates a distressing feeling of unsettlement, as it analyses the desperate and drastic measures of a man struck by tragedies with surgical precision, and even if the first half drags extremely and scratches on the surface painfully long, the concept however works out eventually, for it displays a shocking and outrageous development that gets under the skin, thus making it an unbalanced yet scandalously nauseating dive into the mind of madness that ultimately convinces with its unexpected radicality and perverseness.
⚪
A few months ago, my friend Anne hit me up in the middle of the night to tell me about the grotesque film she has just seen, and as you can conclude yourself, it was this one. What makes this apparently irrelevant incident so special is that she, as far as I can remember, hasn't done something like that before (and she has watched most of the Lars von Trier films, though). I for one only heard about the works of the Spanish director and read about them, but haven't seen any of his titles at that moment. Well, since Anne wanted to know my opinion and hear my thoughts on this feature, I added it to my watchlist, and after I was able to track it down at a thrift store, I finally gave it a watch. Honestly, her reaction was justified, cause this film is indeed extremely different. However, despite its inimitability, it is far from being a perfect. Just like skin, it displays a few flaws. What bothered me about this film is the drastic unbalance between the first and the second half of the film. I am aware that deliberate deception might be an effective narrative device, but in the case of this movie, it unfortunately impairs the plot tremendously. How? Well, in the first half we are somewhat introduced to the characters of this drama, mostly to the surgeon Dr. Robert Legard, his patient Vera and his housekeeper Marilia, the thing is, after more than twenty minutes I for one wasn't able to tell what direction this film is going or, as a matter of fact, what it wants to tell me. At first it seems like a story about an ambitious doctor who would give anything to create the perfect skin, but my justified question is, for what? It goes on and on about this artificially enhanced skin the doctor was able to synthesize but doesn't at all explain why. For a while it is painfully dragging, rough and even boring, I mean, why is that dude in the tiger costume there? However, after that, the film continues with flashbacks, and, after I at first thought that it was unnecessary, the film finally brings itself into line. Via said flashbacks we learn about the tragedy rutted past of Legard, and the gradually given details ultimately add to the monstrous picture. Seriously, after that unnecessarily lacklustre first half, I didn't at all expect the film to become this dark and grotesque. More and more we learn about the surgeon's past and what tragedies he has been through. Next to the car crash that left his beloved wife completely burned and eventually made her commit suicide, we discover that his daughter Norma, traumatised by her mother's untimely death and hence constantly drugged, was raped at a wedding, what causes her psychosis to worsen. Like some kind of sick joke, his daughter then killed herself in the same manner as her mother, and, of course, Legard is completely shattered. After that happened, he tracks down the boy who raped his daughter and kidnaps him. What takes place after that is just insane, I was like ""No, he isn't going to, or is he?"" all the time, and let me put it this way, he did exactly what I thought was going to happen, even though it was indescribably perverse. Just imagine the most outrageous thing you can imagine happening and you got it. Legard's calamities made him go insane, because over time, he makes his victim undergo a gender reversal and remodels the boy in the likeness of his deceased wife. Holy cow?! At first this film seemed like the tragic story of a troubled surgeon who tries to revolutionize the business in an immoral but effective way, but in the end it is the insane tale about a madman who wasn't able to deal with reality and hence lived out his obsession with the past in the most radical degree. After that, the film successfully shifted its character constellation, as there is not a single character who isn't innocent or somewhat evil. Of course, Vera, formerly Vincente, is no angel either, as he still raped the poor girl, but in the end, he is the victim of an atrocious crime. On the other hand, Legard and Marilia, who I thought were the protagonists of an unfortunate chain of events, eventually end up being the true villains of this film. I mean, he committed a crime against nature, and she helped him doing this. I felt sorry for Vera, cause despite all she has done, she didn't deserve this at all. In the end, this unusual film managed to unfold its ingenuity in the latter half, and even if I think that this was powerful in the end, the weak and pointlessly confusing beginning keep me from rating it higher. Nevertheless, a devastating film that left me speechless and gave me the need to talk. Guess who I have hit up afterwards? And so the circle is complete.",positive
"The Skin I Live In is quite a hard film to categorise. It straddles a few genres without being very generic. It's story about an obsessive skin scientist has shades of Frankenstein and the influence of the early work of David Cronenberg but to label this a horror film would be misleading because while some of its themes are undoubtedly horrific it doesn't really play out the conventions of that genre too much. This is mainly a very twisted and morally complex story that just happens to be based on unchecked scientific experimentation.It's a movie that plays with your emotions and responses more than most. As the story develops different characters take on very differing perspectives indeed. Without giving too much away it's central point has to be that beauty may only be skin deep but it's power over us is so overwhelming that it can make us wilfully ignore what really lies beneath the surface. The film hinges on this but it isn't just the characters in the movie who it refers to, we the audience also find it difficult to not be emotionally manipulated by the revelation revealed in the final third of the film. It's not only Antonio Banderas who chooses to forget the past when blinded by beauty.When all the layers have finally been revealed, The Skin I Live In becomes a somewhat uncomfortable and disturbing film. There is certainly some very dark sexuality here. Pedro Almodovar brings it all to the screen in his usual off-centre manner. It's a stylishly shot film. And there are moments that reflect the director's bizarre aesthetic such as the leopard man. Acting is strong. Banderas is very good as the mad scientist, while Elena Anayas is terrific as his subject. She also unquestionably has the requisite beauty required for the role. The sort that is capable of blinding a man.This is the kind of movie that invites post-viewing discussion. Its both uncomfortable and beautiful. A very worthwhile film.",positive
"it gives many ways to discover a profound message about contemporary world. about revenge and obsession and power to the life of the other. about relations. and about sacrifices. about beauty. and, maybe, about Almodovar. nothing surprising. only the performance of Antonio Banderas who does not only a great job but who propose a new level of a career who seems be easily defined. a film who gives many suggestions to interpreted it. and many opportunities to understand it as a personal portrait of every day society. cruel, poetic and cold. a parable and one of wake up films. De Sade and Mary Shelley. and the inspired music. an Almodovar who gives more than his common story about women and relations and revenges and shadows of the past. each of theme is present here but only as tool for a kind of image in mirror. because it is just a story about power. and its ways.",negative
"I love so much about the way Europeans make films. They have so much trust and respect for their audiences. They take the most simple plot lines and make them endlessly complex. But most of all, they leave you thinking long after the movie has ended. All of those things are abundantly true about 'The Skin I Live In'. I had seen the poster for this movie floating around for a number of years now, but never really knew anything about how good it was meant to be. Recently someone recommended it to me and I finally decided to get around to seeing it. I'm very glad that this one didn't pass me by, because it is a very fine film.It would be easy to take for granted just how difficult this film was to pull off. In particular the visual side of the film. It's one thing to just tell the audience what is going on, but another to have them genuinely believe it because of how well you have cast and produced the film. I love that this film makes you question everything you thought you believed. There's something very special about a film that can do that. It's an odd feeling as an audience member. You feel tricked - but in a great way.I can't say this strongly enough: the less you know going into this movie, the more you will enjoy it. Don't watch the trailer, don't read the synopsis, don't even read another word of this review. Just go out and get it, chuck it on and let the film take you on a journey. You won't be disappointed.",positive

"I am a huge fan of Pedro Almodovar, but ""The Skin I Live In"" from 2011 is not my favorite film of his; in fact, it's my least favorite.I was not expecting a horror film from this wonderful director. Unfortunately I hate horror films.Antonio Banderas is a doctor and scientist who keeps a beautiful young female patient (Elena Anaya) in his home while he invents a new type of human skin that won't burn, as his wife was burned in a car crash. Flashbacks show that he has suffered more than one tragedy, and tells the story of what led to this woman being in his home. It's so gross. I'm sorry to leave a review like this that no one will agree with, but I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I stuck with it until the end, but I wanted to turn it off.",negative
"""The skin I live in"" is a horror-drama which leaves the viewer a little puzzled and doubtful, at least, for me it was difficult to give a definite judgment. I'm not a fan of Almodovar's movies, in this case it was certainly capturing and intriguing as there are interesting plot twists, the criticism concerning the unlikeliness, from a scientific and medical point of view, of the story is in my opinion totally out of place, since it is evidently and consciously implausible, as the director consciously built a totally unlikely story just to explore a very dear theme to him, that of identity. And indeed, the stunning idea that we can remain innerly untouched, although physically changed, comes out very clearly, sharply, and violently. What did not convince me: the story lines are not all well developed, moreover, the characters and their relationships are not enough explored. I also found that some typical elements of Almodovar's style, the red, the blood, sexual violence are too extremist, I perceived some morbid scenes and beastly characters as too exacerbated as to get repulsive. But these are simply part of a very ""animal"" and instinctual directorial way of looking at human behaviour, and I simply do not like this style that much.",negative
"I remember seeing the poster or DVD cover for this Spanish film, as I remembered the lead actor next to the woman with some kind of masking on her face, it definitely sounded intriguing from the description I read, directed by Pedro Almodóvar (All About My Mother, Volver, Talk to Her). Basically successful plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) was cultivating an artificial skin resistant to burns and insect bites, but the board forbid him from continuing his research after it was discovered he had been conducting illegal transgenic experiments. At his secluded estate, Ledgard is keeping a beautiful young woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) captive, with the help of his servant Marilia (Marisa Paredes), following his suspension, he asks Marilia to dismiss the other servants. While Robert is out, Marilia's son Zeca (Roberto Álamo) has committed a robbery and asks his mother to hide him for a few days. He sees Vera on security camera screens and demands to see her, Marilia refuses to let him stay, so he blinds and gags her and then rapes Vera, Robert arrives and kills Zeca. While Robert disposes of Zeca's body, Marilia reveals to Vera that she is the both Zeca and Robert's mother, by different men, she never told them, Robert was adopted by Marilia's employers, but ultimately raised by her. In flashback, while Robert went to medical school and married a woman named Gal, Zeca lived in the streets and smuggled drugs, years later he returned, and he and Gal ran off together. They were involved in terrible a car crash which left Gal badly burnt, thereafter she lived in total darkness with no mirrors, it is when she accidentally catches her reflection in a window that she is traumatised by the sight of herself, Gal jumped to her death. In the present, Robert returns and spends the night with Vera. Robert dreams of a night six years ago at a wedding, where he finds his daughter Norma (Blanca Suárez) unconscious on the ground. Norma had been rendered mentally unstable and was taking medication for psychosis, after witnessing her mother's suicide, she comes to believe she has been raped, develops a fear of all men and spends eight years in a mental health facility, eventually killing herself in the same manner of her mother. Vera also dreams about the events of this night, where Vicente (Jan Cornet), a young man who works in the dress shop, crashed the wedding and meets Norma, he is under the influence of drugs, and walks with Norma in the garden. Norma starts removing her clothing, Vincente kisses and compliments her, he is on top of her, she suddenly starts repeating ""no, no, no"" and is screaming, she bites his hand, he is surprised and slaps her, knocking her unconscious, he runs away, confused and nervous, before Robert arrives. Robert tracks down Vicente, kidnaps him, and subjects him to sex reassignment surgery, over six years, Robert physically transforms Vincente into a replica of his late wife, and calls her Vera, during this time Vincente struggles to remain sane and cling to the core of his true identity. After being absent for four years, Marilia returned home to Robert's house to look after Vera (Vincente), who reveals to her that she has been held captive for the last six years. Back in the present, Marilia does not trust Vera, so she is dismayed after finding out about Robert's new relationship with her. Fulgencio (Eduard Fernández), one of Robert's colleagues, reads a newspaper article about the missing Vicente and recognises him as one of their sex change patients. Fulgencio accuses Robert of falsifying Vincente consent for a sex reassignment surgery and of experimenting on him, but Vera arrives to support Robert, asserting his willing participation. During the night, Robert and Vera try to have sex, but Vera tells him she is still sore after being raped, so suggests getting some lubricant, but comes back with a gun and kills Robert and Marilia. Freed from captivity, Vincente (Vera) returns to his mother's dress shop for the first time since being kidnapped. He tearfully tells his lesbian ex-colleague Cristina (Bárbara Lennie), whom Vincente loved six years ago, about the kidnapping, forced sex change and the murders, then his mother (Susi Sanchez) enters, and Vincente says quietly ""I am Vincente"". Banderas is a dangerously driven scientist but almost evokes some sympathy, Anaya is sultry and marvellously mysterious, it is a very similar feel to the French film Eyes without a Face, it definitely keeps you going with all the surreal and shocking twists and turns along the way, it is a perverse and provocative exploration of obsession, desire and identity, a strange but fascinating psychological thriller. It won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",positive
"I had to come here and write a review, I felt compelled to do it actually because nobody can call this ""A Full-on Masterpiece"" without seriously recognizing that is something very wrong with the way you're seeing the human race.This movie depicts the mind a serious deviated psychological psychopath and with big sexual problems.The fact that in the first 15 minutes of movie, out of nowhere I had to endure a rape scene (one of the worst I seen in a movie) and without any justification whatsoever (character development my a..) talks itself pretty clear of the intentions of the director.Almodovar seriously needs a shrink and I am beginning to wonder where are we in the sense of well being if we like this piece of garbage.I like to be entertained in a movie, even shocked or think, but not to be disgusted by the distorted thoughts of a seriously messed up director.If you think watching a couple of really gone wrong humans doing the worst conceivable sexual deviations is your idea of fun then go watch this movie. If you are, like me, a human being that can be considered of good health and like to enjoy the good things in life, avoid this movie like the plague, because it will not only make you feel bad, it will do so without any justification, it is as the director WANT us to make feel bad about all this psychopaths.I have a word for him and all people involved in this movie: NO THANKS.This kinds of movies should not be allowed to exist, they teach so many wrong ways of looking at life that it give me the chills. This is the way to ruin cinema.Compare movies from early years to movies of today and you will see an increment of violence in an exponential way. I wonder what a psycho person will do if it watches this movie... they will just think it's alright to rape anyone in it's path... plain awful. Go watch Body Language and enjoy a movie that actually teaches good things about life.",negative
"A brilliant plastic surgeon (Antonio Banderas), haunted by past tragedies, creates a type of synthetic skin that withstands all kinds of damage. His experimental patient is a mysterious and volatile woman (Elena Anaya) who holds the key to his obsession.This is surely a Pedro Almodóvar film, but it's disturbing even by Pedro's standards. The flashback sequence will seem very convoluted at first, but you need to stick with it. Eventually, it gets to a beautiful compelling crazy place and the home of sexual icky obsessions. If you're an Almodóvar film fan, it'll be a very familiar place. I loath to say much more in case I spoil it.",positive
"Considering the film is by Pedro Almodóvar, I expected it to be quite graphic and challenging to watch--as he has a history of making films that shock the average viewer. Rape, lots of nudity, murder, drug use, copious amounts of blood, a wide variety of sex acts, insanity, sex change surgery completed against a patient's will and many, many other VERY unsavory things await you. In other words, it's par for the course for the director--but also a film that perhaps deserved an NC-17 rating--as it's a bit more intense and kinky than a typical R-rated film--even if it doesn't have the crotch shots you'd expect in an NC-17 film.The story is VERY complicated. So complicated that perhaps it might help if you pull up the Wikipedia summary and follow along as you watch. It's about a bizarro doctor that performs a VERY weird experiment--and what this is all about you only discover later in the film. If I tell much more of the plot, it will spoil the kinky surprises--and there is a doozy. Suffice to say, the Doctor (Antonio Banderas) has a lot of 'splaining to do!So is the film any good? Yes--just like any other Almodóvar film. Plus, for a change, it's a horror movie and a mystery film put together--not the usual warped comedy you might expect from him. But I must warn you--not only is the plot bizarrely sick but it is not a pleasant nor enjoyable film to watch. Understand that it is quite disturbing and....well....weird. I did not love the film and the twist left me feeling a bit queasy...but a well made film nonetheless. You won't mistake this for a Disney film! Watch at your own risk.",positive
"But I'm saying this movie disgusted me on so many levels I can't even express them all.
Forget about the pretentious reviewers who claim there is something thought provoking about this, this is simply some director and screenwriters who should be maybe investigated by the police, these are sick people.",negative
Only a sick mind could tell a story like this. A real nightmare!,negative
"The IMDb full storyline and the movie's official site, including previews, don't prepare you for all the taboos, ethics, moral standards this film is unafraid to break through. The story is oh, so unpredictable! It has special effects that make the gruesome scenes realistic. The aesthetic imagery contrasts with the psychologically horrific moments. Take a minute to read just the IMDb review summaries (all one liners), and you will get a feel for what you do have in store with this film. Moreover, read the official movie's advisories on sex, nudity, violence, gore, profanity and intense scenes; then you probably will not want to see it, or, like me, you will be eager to see if all of it is as extreme as it is depicted to be. I think it's close enough.How director Pedro Almodóvar manages to make all of it make sense, even the bioethics arguments, is a tribute to his skills, I just discovered. Antonio Banderas plays a mad genius surgeon with a complex obsession; an obsession you think is one thing but turns out (about half way into the film) to be wildly different than what you expected. And not only is it different, it pushes the boundaries much further. This film may well revive his reputation with the discerning movie enthusiasts. I had not truly enjoyed a film of his for I don't know how long.Elena Anaya, whose beauty I discovered watching the 2010 erotic drama (nowhere is it written it's erotic, but I know what I saw) ""Room In Rome"", still manages to captivate me. I trust more people wanted to see this movie because of her starring role. I'm not about to forget this movie; I would not recommend it to people who aren't very open minded and don't have a strong stomach. One of the reason I watch an inordinate number of movies, is to catch rare birds like this one; it makes my movie going experience worth the wait.",positive
"Holy cow that's one messed-up story.A Spanish mystery about a plastic surgeon who practiced skin transplant.First of all, there were quite a lot of explicit contents here. Not sure if it's necessary.The most fascinating part was middle part of the movie with a long flashback that showed what happened to the surgeon and how he dealt with the aftermath. And oh boy that was disturbing and gross.Through this messed-up story was the theme of retribution and obsession. It showed a disturbing way that a person could bring about retribution.Overall, a disturbing story with great acting. 7.5/10.",positive
"I felt responsible to write this review to warn anyone who is going to watch this movie.
I was really hoping to question skin transfers, gender issues, disconnection from self, nature of mankind... However I found none of these. The movie do not question anything about all of these or anything. I really wanted see something in the movie other than some random violance. I do not really care about the violance in the movie. This movie did not offer anything for me to question or think about. Such missed opportunity.
There are times that is going to make you say ""Oh! Awesome the movies is about this and that"" but then it fails. With the name of this movie you can make lots of movies and every one of them can mean something.
It did not scare me. I was not thrilled or anything. It was not dark. It was just a hollow movie about a surgeon who is obsessive about his wife and a guy who can keep his identity with yoga.",negative
"One of THE worst movies I have ever seen!! I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters and by the end of the movie I was wishing they all would die. None of them had any redeeming qualities as far as I was concerned. Normally, I love foreign films, art films, but this was just a BIG waste of my time. I have seen a few of Pedro Almodovar's films so I was expecting bizarre twist and turns but this was not as well done as some of his other works. I agree with another reviewer that Almodovar might be an acquired taste, but since I had seen his work before I was disappointed with this outing.",negative

"It is true that The Skin I Live In is an odd movie but that doesn't mean it is a bad one. It's not only the twist that makes it good but also the great cinematography, acting and the whole atmosphere of this movie.There are many people complaining that this movie is disgusting because of the main idea of the plot (a male being turned into a female) and that's the main reason why it gets so much hate. But it is this weird and disturbing plot that makes this movie unique. It's not only the unexpected twist that makes it unusual but also its dark atmosphere and great storytelling.I don't think that there is any need to discuss the acting as it was on a very high level. The cinematography was also very well done. It's more than evident that the director worked hard for this movie and thus did a great job.The Skin I Live In is indeed an odd movie that might disturb certain people but it still is a good film that deserves to be seen.",positive
"A brilliant plastic surgeon (Antonio Banderas), haunted by past tragedies, creates a type of synthetic skin that withstands any kind of damage. His guinea pig: a mysterious and volatile woman who holds the key to his obsession.The film has been compared to ""Eyes Without a Face"" (1960), and there is a clear visual homage to the old French film. But this film goes much further, is much more extreme, and the similarities end early on.While the film is gritty at times in its subject matter, it is shot beautifully and this makes it art when it could have just been exploitation or straight horror. In fact, despite being horror, it is hard to see it as such because it is so stylish.",positive
"Even a long-standing passion for Almodovar like my wife's and mine could not save this from being his his worst film we have seen, ever (I hope we should not say ""to date""). Starting from a superficial, almost childish depiction of the deviant surgeon's research this movie does little else than indulging in clichés. Would it have been so hard to obtain competent medical/scientific advice and write a more credible script?Even the elegant cinematography cannot rescue such a poor plot, uninteresting dialogues and complete lack of psychological depth of the main character.In summary this is a completely uninspired Almodovar and what a missed opportunity for restarting work with Antonio Banderas.Sorry Pedro, but you can do a lot better than that.",negative
"Normally a fan of Almodovar, I was waiting with anticipation to see this new film. The storyline and trailer seemed weird, raw, colourful, elements you come to expect from the director. However, the lack of story to bind the story to the picture, to make us identify in some ways with the characters, to make us discover existential meanings in the story/characters, all these things were missing. And it is difficult to rely purely on beautiful pictures and ""weird"" scenarios that for one, have been also used in other films by the same director. Thus, without a strong story I didn't feel convinced by the movie. Watching this film, I felt indifferent about the story and whatever twist was there in it. Almodovar usually is detail oriented and also allows actors to bring their interpretation and personalities in the movie. I also felt that the actors had such rigid roles that they didn't have much room to act and to really absorb into the movie. Antonio Banderas gave nothing to the performance as compared to his older performances in Almodovar films. Similarly was Marisa Paredes also not challenged or allowed to shine and Elena Anaya, although she was good, had no room to act. All in all, trying too hard to create mystery, suspense, while there is no story to add meaning to the somewhat ""weird"" events.",negative
"Interesting and original movie. The time-jumps make it a bit confusing though, and the subject matter is a touch disturbing. Good performances from Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya.",positive
"Unless you like post-modernistic movies this is one to avoid. Nothing here makes sense and there is no clear plot.I just can't even recall all the issues with the movie. There are 100 or something, it's not terrible it's just all pointless. It's about a doctor who kidnaps a man he thinks raped his daughter, he actually didn't, and then makes into a perfect woman. That's it, that's the whole plot I promise. There is nothing else here. No other plot line is uncovered or completed.Firstly, there a man in a tiger costume who visits the house and rapes the woman. He's the son of the housekeeper who is also secretly the mother of the doctor, but she refuses to tell him that. This son is then shot dead as he is raping the woman. But the ""woman"" actually looks like his former lover which is why he is so eager to rape her. The doctor made the man look exactly as his dead wife who this tiger dude ran away with in the past. This tiger man, his brother, is just inexplicably a horrible actor. That's just one of these things you cannot forgive. To prove to his mom, the housekeeper, that he is her son he shows her his full ass to show a birthmark on the upper part of his ass. Now, why did he do that if the birthmark is at the top? I don't know. Why did he rape the woman if he thought it was his former lover? Who the hell knows?Nothing here makes any sense. How could the doctor create a perfect woman out of a man? Who the hell knows? Why did he let this man/woman roam around and get access to a gun? Who the hell knows? Why did he even kidnap him or do any of this? Nothing is explained.It's one huge mess. Even the ending goes nowhere. The kidnapped guy kills the mom and doctor and goes visit his own mom. And that's it. What's the point of any of this? I guess if you love pretentious movies this is something you'd enjoy, but it's hard to really tell you what to recommend here. The plot is terrible. I guess it's good camerawork and the plot does seem to go somewhere so I kept watching. But I will forget this flick in a week. There is nothing here.",negative
"Let me tell you first that I seldom write Internet Movie DataBase reviews anymore, although I have in fact written several. With this film I shall make an exception, because if I though that many of the latest Tarantino films were sick, then I must admit that I have fallen way short. Before I forget, and most important: Almodovar needs a shrink, and he needs it bad and urgently. This piece of crap deals with the most unrealistic -nonetheless disgustingly sick- script I have ever come across, exception made, of course, of science-fiction. The 3/10 rating stands for a barely almost-standard script unfolding, but don't get me wrong: this is definitely a piece of s**t. Don't lose your time and don't contribute to an even more degenerate world than that we're already living in.",negative
"I am probably not the best person here to comment on a film by the hugely popular Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Of the man's 19 films to date, I had only seen precisely one--his seventh, 1988's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" and that many years ago. But that film had struck me as being wildly funny and entertaining, I recall, so it was with great enthusiasm that I popped Almodovar's 18th offering, ""The Skin I Live In,"" into my DVD player the other night. Originally presented in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2011 under its Spanish appellation ""La Piel Que Habito,"" the picture, as it turns out, is just remarkable; one of those films that makes you want to start checking out/checking off all the other items in its creator's oeuvre. Very much a modern-day horror classic, the film takes a healthy dose of Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 classic ""Vertigo,"" mixes in a large serving of Georges Franju's 1959 wonder ""Eyes Without a Face,"" spices the mix with a dash of Michael Winner's 1974 crowd-pleaser ""Death Wish,"" and emerges somehow, thanks to its director's canny ability, as a unique creation unto itself.In the film, the viewer makes the acquaintance of a nice-looking, widower surgeon named Dr. Robert Ledgard (exceptionally well played by Antonio Banderas, here appearing in his sixth Almodovar film; his first with the director since 1990's ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!""), who has just been warned by the president of his medical association to cease his experiments employing the process known as ""transgenesis."" Ledgard, it seems, has discovered a way to create a tougher, mosquito-resistant skin employing the cells of pigs. Though he outwardly seems to comply with the president's wishes, Ledgard, the viewer soon learns, has been performing illegal skin grafts on a beautiful young woman named Vera Cruz (36-year-old Spanish actress Elena Anaya) at his secluded country estate near Toledo. Vera is very much a prisoner in Ledgard's villa, we sense, kept behind a locked door while Ledgard observes her remotely via a humongous, wall-size monitor. Meanwhile, we flash back to six years earlier, and learn that Ledgard's daughter had once been (kinda sorta) raped by a young man named Vicente, driving her to psychosis and suicide. The enraged Ledgard had kidnapped Vicente and had kept him locked in a room, as well. And that is just the beginning of this remarkably unhinged story....For this viewer, the ""aha moment"" when we first realize what these two stories from different time frames have to do with one another was one of the most pleasurable and thrilling times I've had with a motion picture in ages. Almodovar, as director and screenwriter here (the story, by the way, is apparently loosely based on French author Thierry Jonquet's 1984 novel ""Mygale,"" released here in the U.S. as ""Tarantula""), keeps the viewer guessing, and the film's numerous time shifts and discrete story lines will surely make some wonder just what the heck is going on. My advice: Just stay with it, and know that everything will come together quite coherently, and that when it does, it's gonna be a doozy! Besides the wonderful contributions of Almodovar and his two lead actors, ""The Skin I Live In"" also boasts an excellent score by Alberto Iglesias and top-notch lensing by cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine; both had worked with the director at least half a dozen times previously. The set decoration on this film, by Vicent Diaz, is also stunning, and Ledgard's villa, complete with bizarre wall paintings and assorted oddball decor, is a genuine feast for the eyes. Kudos must also go out to Marisa Paredes as Ledgard's ""housekeeper"" Marilia, although she is far from just a housekeeper, as the viewer learns; here, she serves a somewhat similar role as the great Italian actress Alida Valli in the Franju film. Adding a decided touch of outre weirdness to an already bizarre film is Roberto Alamo as Marilia's son Zeca, who, dressed in a Carnivale tiger costume, barges into the house, on the run, and proceeds to force himself on Vera! For this viewer, though, it is Banderas who steals the show; his thesping here was something of a revelation for me, who had not previously seen him perform as a leading man, or indeed in anything other than the 1993 Tom Hanks vehicle ""Philadelphia."" Handsome, suave, easily dominating every scene that he appears in, and yet evincing a definite touch of crazed obsession that is apparent at his core, he gives us a performance here that is surely one to remember; a pity that the only prize Banderas garnered for his work in this film was a, um, Fangoria Chainsaw Award! Elena Anaya, happily, DID manage to win a Golden Globe for her performance, and deservedly so. Surprisingly, ""The Skin I Live In"" itself was not even nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar; it might have been my choice, but then again, I still have not seen that year's winner, the Iranian picture ""A Separation."" But good as Asghar Farhadi's film is supposed to be, I cannot imagine it being more colorful, or surprising, or more clever and satisfying, than Almodovar's picture. Ending on a wonderful note, in which both Vera and Vicente seem to be offered a chance at love and happiness, the film truly is a winner on every level. Y'know, I think I'm finally ready to take in Almodovar's ""Matador"" and ""Volver"" now. I can see how this dude just might prove, uh...what's the Spanish word for ""addicting""?",positive
"A film directed by Pedro Almodovar is always going to be weird, but this one is off the scale. A brilliant plastic surgeon Antonio Banderas) kidnaps the handsome young junkie who raped his daughter and exacts a ghastly revenge.Almodovar never does anything by halves, so there's two of everything in this story: two rapists (the second is dressed and made-up like a dancer from Cats, for God's sake!); two suicidal women; eventually, a double shooting. Psychotic surgeons have been a recurring theme in movies, with Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE the high point of the sub-genre and CIRCUS OF HORRORS its nadir (Anton Diffring, one of the great bad actors of his era!). Is Almodovar paying homage to these or is he sending up Ross Hunter's MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION (1954)? Pedro's movies always have a glossy sheen and over-the-top female characters reminiscent of Fifties melodramas.Returning to his former 'mentor' after 20-odd years, Antonio Banderas looks to be out of his 'comfort zone'; this is a different kind of camp from ZORRO. Some of the dialogue, especially in the early scenes, is stilted (perhaps it's better in Spanish) and the pace is leaden.We expect an Almodovar movie to be preposterously, even gloriously, outrageous. THE SKIN I LIVE IN is deft but daft.",negative
"The Skin I Live In (2011) follows a surgeon who creates a synthetic skin that can withstand burns and bug bites. He tests this skin out on a woman he's holding captivate. This film has an incredible interesting premise and is an absolute masterpiece of a film! I loved every second and it's most definitely one I'll never forget.Firstly, the score felt unique and experimental which set the tone perfectly. I felt immediately uneasy and knew straightaway that I was in for a wild ride. It was very recognisable and made the film pleasing to listen to as well as to watch.Due to the incredibly different cinematography, the film looked a lot older than it was but I definitely consider this a positive! There was some great focus shifts and the colour palettes were bleak and fit the mood. Also, the use of character silhouette was artistic and intriguing.The film was a very intimate portrait of a man driven mad by obsession and definitely focused more on character, to which it was successful. The acting was brilliant and all of the performers gave it their all, I particularly liked Elena Anaya as Vera, she was astonishing and captivating. Alongside this, the dialogue was engaging and super well written.This movie was consistently interesting throughout and was packed full of shocking and unexpected twists and turns. It was quite slow paced, but this gave the filmmakers time to go in depth with the plot and make it really quite complex! Not to mention, the film is also gruesome and genuinely disturbing in a very psychological way with an impactful ending. The structure was good too, using flashbacks to reveal more of the plot and shocking moments.",positive
"""The Skin I Live In"" is the latest Spanish film from writer and director Pedro Almodóvar who once again explores issues of sexuality, rape, and extremely dysfunctional relationships. Set in the future, as in, next year, a scientist, Robert (Antonio Banderas), has invented the ""perfect"" skin. Presumably to help burn victims. But things get more mysterious, sinister and unnatural.Continuing in the present we are given hints as to how unhinged, immoral and obsessed Robert can be. I naively assumed that he was only slightly so. He's just a scientist who lost his wife in an accident; it's only natural for him to operate a little different than the rest of us.The second third of the film gives us the back story. Everything that I thought I had inferred from the beginning was wrong, completely wrong. I loved how they made me think, and then decipher it all again. But then I realized how aberrant and disturbing the story actually was.The last third of the film takes us back to the story unfolding in the present. While I did want to see how the denouement played out, I also wanted to see how others were responding to this film. I squirmed uncomfortably in my seat and looked around the theatre to see most people laughing nervously. ""The Skin I Live In"" is far from a comedy but nervous laughter does seem to be the right response.As Almodóvar probably sees it, all problems (or any problem) can stem from pre-mature sexuality. Even if it's not rape to some, it will be to others. I don't think he ever really presents a solution, just that no good can ever come of it.""The Skin I Live In"" gets into the mind of some disturbed individuals. One who is just naturally criminally-inclined, one who has selfishly decided to control things that he cannot, or should not, control, and one who was forced into a world of torment. The paintings on the walls and the pristine order of a house which could double as a prison all speak to what's inside the mind.",positive
"This film is being billed as a ""horror"" film or a ""thriller"", but is neither. It is a disgusting mess, and contains an unnecessarily explicit rape scene which the director almost seems to gloat over. None of the characters is appealing. They are all depressed, mad or criminal in some way, and the whole experience left me feeling like I needed a shower. I don't want to ""spoil"" the experience for anyone, but I would just say that you need a strong stomach, a good dose of insensitivity and a willingness to not laugh out loud at some ridiculous plot twists. Throughout, Antonio Banderas looks like he wishes he was somewhere else, and his expression never changes, whatever ridiculous development comes.",negative
"Let's get a few things straight, right from the beginning:First of all, i assume that all of those who are posting here words like ""pure visual poetry, A tour de force"" or ""A full-on masterpiece"" are paid to do so. Otherwise, i can't understand why would they say so for a movie that made me take the remote in my hands, willing to switch this movie off, just about after 10 minutes of play.To my eyes, this was nothing more than a cheap soap opera, one of those that we got invaded with, since the 80's. The director mixed things up trying to shock, but somehow, he lost it in the mix.Almoldovar presented us a potato that wasn't really a potato.. but an orange, oh no.. was it a tomato ?A boy that was born by the housekeeper, adopted at birth by her employers. He will grow up never knowing that he was adopted although his real mother will serve into his house even by the time when he will became a renowned surgeon, which wasn't really a surgeon but more like some obsessed scientist, later to became a revenging father of a suicidal rape mental disordered daughter.The surgeon's wife getting laid with housekeeper's second son (her brother in law), to die carbonized in a car accident, later to find out she didn't actually died there and on top of all... a sick passion developed by the not so surgeon, for a woman patient that wasn't so woman after all, but his daughter rapist, kidnapped and transformed into a woman.. looking exactly like the dead wife, as a revenge for what he did to his daughter.While this rapist got a ""facelift"" and a Vaginoplasty, the ""brother in law"" enter into the scene by posting his face on the intercom wearing a tiger suit, asking his mother to let him in. From there, to the point where the mother was tied to a chair while he was riding again on what he believed to be the old wife.. was a blink of an eye.Now let's see.. can you think to anything more sick and depraved than above mentioned to bring into this ""masterpiece"" ? Could you fall in love with your daughter rapist anyway, regardless how it may look, knowing who is he? I wonder what Freud would have said about this..If you are a normal person, sensitive, with unaltered and healthy point of view about life,society and family, this movie will point your finger on the on-off button on your remote... after playing it for 10 minutes.Judging by how overrated is this movie, and the large amount of positive feedback.. made it obvious to me one more time,that we are living in a godless, sick world, and it's getting worst day by day. Make sure your kids won't see this !PS. Hitchcock's ""It's only a movie Dear!"" won't fit here.",negative
"Pedro Almodóvar's movies have a habit of pulling the rug from under your feet and 'The Skin I Live In' might do so to an extent that none of his other movies have succeeded. The twists of the story are so ludicrous and disturbing that it raises questions about what kind of man could've come up with such stuff. Well, actually the movie is based on a book so Almodóvar can't be credited for that.The movie is set in the high class society of Madrid and most of it takes place in a luxurious and secretive mansion, decorated and furnished in style. But who is the prisoner kept behind locked doors, and what does she have to do with the wealthy top-of-the-line plastic surgeon who owns the mansion? There's bloody murder, mistaken identities, several rape scenes and a man dressed up in a stupid tiger costume. For a similar shocking storyline, check out Ethan Hawke's 'Predestination'.",positive
"There are two dream sequences in this film attributed to two of the main characters. The biggest dream however is the one you went to watch. This is almost an 'autobiographic' Pedro dream/fantasy. I can well believe that Almodovar dreams/dreamt of having his body kidnapped and ending up in the skin and body of the other gender. I could also imagine him desiring to be in the body/shape of Penelope Cruz. This story has been some time in the imagination of the Director and now we can see it for ourselves. As a fantasy it is inventive, curious and gruesome. As a murder-mystery it is down right peculiar. As entertainment, it is down right peculiar. My verdict then is that it is Almodovar peculiar - exactly as you would expect!",negative
"The work of lauded Spanish writer/director Pedro Almodovar has always been relatively unclassifiable. While his movies clearly bare his fingerprints, the tone can often switch between high drama and comedy, tragedy and farce, restrained and sexually liberated, and often within the same scene. 'Melodrama' is the tag he usually receives, but his vision is far more complex than that. The Skin I Live In, a film which reunites him with actor Antonio Banderas 22 years after Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989) is perhaps his most genre-conscious yet. It's a teasing thriller cleverly disguised as a horror, taking inspiration from classics and art-house pieces that explored both the beauty and horror of the human form, and our eagerness to tamper with it.The reserved and clearly mad plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (Banderas) is on the verge of a breakthrough in the development of a synthetic human skin; one that avoids blemishing and has a resistance to mosquito bites and even fire. While his ethics are questioned by his peers, he also holds a terrible secret. At his home, he keeps a beautiful woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) locked away in a white room surrounded by cameras. The images are shown throughout the house, and Robert usually watches with fascination and desire on a huge screen that takes up most of the wall its perched upon. His loyal housekeeper Marilia (Marisa Paredes) also seems to harbouring a secret, and when her violent son Zeca (Roberto Alamo) returns, he sets off a sequence of events that will affect the lives of everyone involved. To give any more of the plot away would be to reveal too much, and Almodovar is happy to tease us by jumping back and forth between the past, present and the not- too- distant past.It could be argued that this technique is a cheap tactic, but Almodovar wants to keep us from making any knee-jerk judgements until we've fully grasped the mindset of the characters. The movie goes to some seriously twisted places, and would perhaps be laughable if the events weren't so masterfully and elegantly pieced together. The doctor is terribly mad - this is evident early on - but Almodovar is clearly intrigued and seduced by Ledgard's dedication to his craft and his obsession over his creation. Banderas is brilliant in the role and reveals a more reserved and darker side to the persona seen in his American movies, as is Anaya, who manages to exercise a range of emotions through those stunning brown eyes of hers. If you enjoyed the themes explored in the likes of Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face (1960), Hiroshi Teshigahara's The Face of Another (1966) and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, then The Skin I Live In will no doubt fascinate you as it wanders into some incredibly dark places.",positive

This sci-fi thriller starts with the patient locked up in a room and on camera 24/7.Almodovar uses flashbacks from six years previous to explain the present situation. I prefer a more linear style, but it works o.k. here if you stay with it with patience. A major flaw is the casting of Anaya in the lead role; she is too pretty once the secret is revealed, which I won't do to avoid posting a spoiler alert which occurs about 2/3 of the way in.The director's visual high standard is apparent again, no surprise, and the script is competent with a good cast overall. The ending is nothing special, something we've seen before many times, but nonetheless the film is well made and an entertaining diversion-a 7.5.",positive
"I've long admired Almodovar and it was with interest that I went to his his latest ""horror"" film. To describe it thus is most certainly to misappropriate a psychological study of sexuality because it is most certainly not a horror movie. Instead we see Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya develop the most unlikely relationship you'll see in a very long time.Banderas is electric as the cool and calculated surgeon using Anaya (wow) as his human guinea pig to develop a new kind of indestructible skin as he grieves the death of his wife as a consequence of a car fire.It's pretty hard to cover much more of the plot for fear of spoiling what is a tremendous film with perhaps the best twist I've ever seen in a cinema. Almodovar is at his very best hear with an excellent supporting cameraman, Jose Luis Alcaine who makes the pictures zing from the digital screening that I was at.Interestingly I saw Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy today as well and both were sound tracked by Alberto Iglesias. This one brilliantly, Tinker, Tailor lamentably.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. I will readily admit to being a huge Pedro Almodovar fan. His films regularly place on my year-end Best Of list. I do admire his creativity, tough women characters,visual acumen and multi-dimensional stories. With Almodovar, we can bank on some type of dalliance with death, a brush with sexual deviance, non-linear time lines, plots that twist and turn incessantly, a color palette to make Frida Kahlo envious and psychological darkness that forces us to look inward. All of these elements are present here ... but somehow it doesn't quite click.Antonio Banderas plays Dr. Robert Ledgard, a plastic surgeon revered for his work in face transplants. What the medical profession doesn't know is that Dr. Ledgard takes the mad scientist label to whole new dimension. And he does it with the coolness reserved for the other side of the pillow. I will not go into details of the story other than to say Banderas' character would make Dr. Frankenstein turn away in disgust.Dr. Ledgard lives in a beautiful mansion with his protective housekeeper played by Almodovar veteran Marissa Paredes. He also has a live-in patient named Vera, played wonderfully by Elena Anaya. Support work is also provided by Jim Cornet as Vicente. I wish I could tell you more of the characters, but can't without giving away too much.Dr. Legard and Vera are two of the most fascinating characters ever written by Almodovar and the film is a twisted road to discomfort all wrapped up in a silky smooth picture frame. From a filmmaking perspective, I couldn't rate it much higher. From an entertainment perspective, it would be near the bottom of the most interesting or desirable Almodovar films. Am I disappointed? Sure, a little. But not enough to override my excitement for the next film by Almodovar!",negative
"You will enjoy particular films even more if you do not know very much beforehand; think The Sixth Sense or The Crying Game. Previews nowadays give away everything including the set up, the conflict, its climax, and sometimes even the ending all before you go and see it. The preview for The Skin I Live In sidesteps the problem of giving things away by only showing select scenes set to music. There is no dialogue to listen to for the potential audience member to find out who is doing what and why. Whoever had the idea to limit this preview did everyone a favor.I will only cover the basics of the plot because you really want to go into this film as 'blind' as possible. Robert Legard (Antonio Banderas) is a brilliant scientist and surgeon. He is on the leading edge of his field which has far exceeded standard plastic surgery. He has been involved in the first face transplants and is conducting extensive and methodical research into creating a new form of skin, one which is tougher than normal human skin whose practical application is to help burn victims but has the possibility to go much further than that.At home, Robert is just as methodical and precise as he is at work. His live-in house keeper Marilia (Marisa Paredes) runs a tight ship to keep everything in order and Robert's personal research lives upstairs in a locked room. Vera (Elena Anaya) is Robert's captive and his prized research specimen. I will stop the set up description right here.Directed by Pedro Almodovar, The Skin I Live In is a suspenseful thriller and verges on horror; however, in the director's own words, it is a ""horror story without screams or frights"". Robert is a modern day mad scientist, but instead of having an open lab with electricity captured from lightening bolts, he has a scalpel and a sterile workspace. Almodovar adapted the screenplay from Tarantula, a novel by Thierry Jonquet.Since it is an Almodovar film, The Skin I Live In contains certain themes which are very common in most of his films. The first is that it has family secrets. Almodovar loves family secrets; think back to All About My Mother and Volver which were oozing to the core with them. He is a director who loves to go into people's attics, find a chest full of dusty old secrets, pop the lid, and rip them out just like he would old clothes.The second theme here which we have seen Almodovar cover before is gender identity. How society and individuals view themselves as male and female has always intrigued him, most recently in Bad Education. There are scenes here which reminded me a bit of The Human Centipede but it is nowhere near that tasteless or insane. The Skin I Live In wanders around a bit at first before you learn what is really going on and the reasons behind it. Once you learn that, you will understand it has not been wandering around at all, it has just been setting you up for one hell of a story.",positive
"Enigmatic at first, The Skin I Live In (also known as La piel que habito) peels its layers one by one, for it is mysterious during its first act, delivers a shocking jolt in the middle when all the scattered dots are connected, and culminates on a tragic & heartbreaking note in the finale to finish as one psychological thriller that's exquisitely crafted & expertly told.The story of The Skin I Live In follows a plastic surgeon who's managed to create a synthetic skin that can withstand any kind of damage. Unbeknownst to the outside world, his patient is a young woman whom he's kept captive in his secluded estate over the years. As the plot moves forward, the events that led him on the path of his current obsession are revealed.Written & directed by Pedro Almodóvar, this is my first stint with his works and although the story seemed to be headed nowhere at first, the mystifying aura of it was able to keep the interest alive long enough before the secrets are unveiled, and ultimately leaves a positive impression when it's all over. Themes of obsession, identity, sexual violence & revenge are tackled & finely explored.The images brim with a piercing clarity and the entire film is gorgeously photographed from start to finish. Camera is effectively utilised and whether it's calm or chaotic scenes, it retains its still & silent operation. Editing is finely carried out for the most part although there are a few times when a scene lingers on for longer than required. As for the background score, it absolutely bleeds when it's supposed to.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Antonio Banderas, Elena Anaya, Marisa Paredes & Jan Cornet, and everyone plays their part dutifully. Banderas is in as the plastic surgeon whose obsession with his only patient originates from a past tragedy. Anaya is terrific as the mysterious & volatile patient, Paredes maintains a firm control over her character while Cornet's part is far more vital to the plot than it looks.On an overall scale, The Skin I Live In is perplexing & frustrating at first but begins to make sense once all the pieces of the puzzle find their respective spots and form a unified whole. A gripping, thrilling & scarring experience, with elements of horror & sci-fi thrown into the mix, The Skin I Live In is an end result of restrained direction from Almodóvar & honest performances from its faithful cast, and is definitely worth a watch.",negative
"The movie is clearly a beautifully made film. Elena Anaya's beautiful eyes alone (not to mention the rest) filmed in a particularly focused way, make it so. Every actor plays great, with Antonio Banderas being the perfect controlled mad scientist. When I saw the movie I couldn't help thinking that it was another take on Eyes Without a Face, and from what I understand the similarity was completely intentional, along with references to some Hitchcock movies.The pace of the film is also reminiscent of a 1960 movie, which helps it in some regards, but hinders the enjoyment in others. The twisted mentality of ALL the characters (are Spaniards cuckoo?) reminded me of Poe adaptations starring Vincent Price. All in all, this makes the movie seem slightly dated, but also captivating. I found it hard to believe that it was recommended to me by people ten year my younger.Bottom line: it was sold to me as horror, and in some ways it is more horrifying than most, but only if it hits that uncanny chord in your mind. Otherwise it is just a twisted thriller, reminiscent of movies in the 1960's. If you know Eyes Without a Face, think of La piel que habito like a sister film and a tip of the hat.",positive
"It's unfortunate that some Directors are not able to realize when their time has passed! Tried to watch this but since it made no sense, figured it would be best to give up. This is nothing as clever or funny as Almodovar's previous movies. It's just simply......rubbish!",negative
"Pedro Almodovar has at least one good film that is not skin deep: The Skin I Live In explores the mad scientist in a thriller that shows a brilliant cosmetic surgeon, Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas), channeling Dr. Frankenstein, Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Alfred Hitchcock.In the futuristic 2012, Ledgard uses a new transgenic skin, manufactured from pig DNA, to transform deformed subjects beautiful, but as in all allegories that have characters playing god, nothing really good follows this arrogance.Ledgard has suffered the loss of his wife and tries very hard to save his daughter, Norma (Blanca Suarez). The antidote to his despair is to change patients literally into the images of his losses while in effect kidnapping and imprisoning to achieve his goal, although the gilded cage that is his estate is impressive. But then his mother-like assistant, Marilia (Marissa Paredes), is complicit, bringing the Greek-like scenario into full dramatic trajectory. Oh, yes, a sibling rapist (Roberto Alamo) in his tiger outfit is horrifyingly involved, completing the tragic family drama.Although Almodovar has long been an admirer of women (see Penelope Cruz), he has not found in them the face he has here of Elena Anaya (playing Vera Cruz), perfect in its beauty and vulnerable in it femininity. She is his artistic creation symbolizing his dual nature of benign surgeon and mad scientist. Dr. Ledgard's cool is juxtaposed with Cruz's growing passion, a threat to the aseptic laboratory, which up till now has been invulnerable.Yet Almodovar has peopled his thriller with other interesting minor characters; for instance, Vincente (Jan Cornet) is a drug-addled clerk in a second-hand clothing store, where he fruitlessly tries to seduce a lesbian played by Barbara Lennie. What happens to Cornet is the ultimate expression of the doctor's genius and revenge.As in Hawthorne's Birthmark, Almodovar seems to be making a comment about the nature of creation, art, and the human tendency to overreach. At least I think so; with this film, there's much to be appreciated. Maybe too much",negative
"Almodovar's latest work ""The skin I live in"", despite views expressed by some critics and audience about its darker side, is in fact rather mild compared with some of his earlier work. While categorised variously as ""devious"", ""pervert"" etc in his earliest works, Almodovar had already started to soften with ""Tie me up, tie me down"" (1990) which offered but a little bit of kinkiness. Crossing the century line, going from ""All about my mother"" (1999) to ""Talk to her"" (2002), he virtually mellowed. In ""Bad education"" (2004), he even sauntered into the realm of melodrama. In ""Volver"" (2006), generally hailed as one of his best, there is little left of the provocative auteur who seem in his earlier work vowed to shock. Next came ""Broken promises"" (2009) which continued with the play on complicated relationships and events in a gentle mood.Having gone down memory lane of the auteur's work in the last decade, it is perhaps not difficult to understand why people consider ""The skin I live in"" a return of the old Almodovar. This is true, but only in part. The basic premises of the story is rather outrageous (one prominent critic described it as ""funny"") and there are elements of sexual perversity that has been branded with Almodovar. But there is really little by way of gore and blood, by Almodovar standard. While in that department, may I say that if you've seen Michael Heneke's ""Cache"" and survived, you have become shock-proof. Also interesting is that on the day prior to watching ""The skin I live in"", I saw ""Twilight 4.1"" complete with sweet Bella's childbirth scene. ""The skin I live in"" is not even close! FULL spoiler ahead.What follows is really intended for those who have already seen the movie. There is one montage that clearly gives away the twist, but perhaps only people who have actually heard about it would catch on. This is when during the middle of the flashback story of Vicente there is one brief cut-away into a continuation of the present with Robert and Vera in bed for no particular reason. As this very brief scene fade out with the profile of Vera's face on the left side of the screen, fading in on the right side, facing Vera, is the profile of Vicente. For those who already know about the twist, this is all too obvious. But even those who don't may notice this conspicuous manipulation and catch on.Whether this one is as disturbing as some of his earlier work or not, the signature hallmarks of Almodovar are clearly there. While the storytelling is easy to follow, there are always things that rise out of the mundane, for example, Norma's death is foretold, almost nonchalantly, when we learn about her mother's death. The framing of each and every shot is mesmerizing. The colour schemes, while not as flashy as usual, are equally attention-commanding. The cast led by Antonio Banderas (in a 20-year reunion with the director since ""Tie me up, tie me down"") is brilliant. Most, I understand, are Almodovar regulars, including bewitchingly beautiful Elena Anaya.",negative
"This movie has been in my watchlist for years, ever since Horrible Reviews included it in his Most Disturbing Movies Ever series. I finally got around to watching it and I don't really know how to describe the experience. This is a slow, character-driven, thematically complex film with a great twist. I included a spoiler warning because I think saying a film has a twist will make you anticipate it. Luckily I didn't know, and like all great twists you don't see it coming, it's shocking when you find out, and makes total sense in hindsight. The acting is mostly subdued but classy, which makes perfect sense for the story. The disturbing aspect doesn't really kick in until the second half, and I give them credit for how f'ed up they went with it. Even after one viewing I can tell there are many layers to dissect concerning sexuality, personal identity, revenge, and power. The only things holding it back for me is it drags in the middle, the presentation while well shot was fairly standard, and the ending felt pretty abrupt. If you're a fan of disturbing movies and/or quality films in general, I'd say it's worth a watch. I really don't want to say much else, you really just need to see it for yourself.I rate it an 8/10 because it's better than an 8 but not quite a 9 and IMDb doesn't allow ratings in half star intervals.",positive
"What exactly is plastic surgeon Dr. Robert Ledgard(Banderas, brilliant, obsessed) working on in the top-level facility in his home? And who is his subject?I haven't read the book, or watched much else by Almodóvar. This is about fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, identity, how do we define ourselves and who we are. Like a lot of genre fiction, this explores the things men do to women. To their bodies. Claiming to do it out of love. Even specifically of that girl. Then why do they fight through her protests? Even complain at them? Say she should be happy about it? Take advantage of her trusting nature? Justify, excuse, but not apologize for, what they're doing to them? ""There's some sex in all violence, and vice versa"", Cronenberg is quoted as saying in 2005. If not for when it came out, this film could easily be the main reason for him saying it.There's a huge exposition dump a quarter into this, with one bit after another of backstory. It's literally one person telling all this to another. The revelations are powerful, and couldn't have been done much smoother or such, but it does stop the pace dead for a little while. And almost halfway through, it jumps chronologically. I'm not sure it could have been done very differently. Still. It does have an effect. It's disorienting. A few story elements come off as sloppy and convenient, albeit they do clearly fit. Maybe one or two more drafts would have ironed out these problems.This has a lot of deeply disturbing content: not everyone will be able to handle the material. The running time is 115 and a half minutes with end credits, or 109 without. My DVD had no special features, only subtitles. I recommend it to any fan of horror-sci-fi. 8/10",positive
"At two hours long, it might be argued that the story is spread a little thin. It looks so good, however, and is played so well, that isn't really a problem.At times during the early part of this film I was finding it hard to keep up with the flurry of characters that were introduced apace, sometimes in flashback, sometimes not. As events rolled on, though, I found they all had a place, and a story to tell.I really enjoyed this. A great, sprawling, artily directed production, for all its echoes of classic horror films ('Eyes with a Face' and 'Frankenstein' come to mind), the result is nevertheless less of a horror than you might imagine - but I can't see it disappointing anybody.Of the players, Antonio Banderas gives a menacing and measured performance as Robert Ledgard, and Elena Anaya is excellent, her portrayal of the strangely self-harming Vera giving nothing away as to what is going on behind those big brown eyes. Mt score for this haunting film is 8 out of 10.",positive
"This is disturbing and sick on so many levels that i lost counting but god damn this is a masterpiece as a movie, writing this right here is difficult because my head is still procesing what i just seen,i think this will hold on for some days. Watch it!",positive
This was a fantastic movie. Very intriguing. Love Antonio Banderas.,positive
This film is a masterpiece. All horror fans must watch as you can not believe this film. Sometimes the plot gets a bit lost but overall amazing.,positive
"this film looks ravishing; a joyful cinematography and a vibrating use of color palette. Almodovar is passionate about the stories he tells; i'm an admirer of his absurdness, free sexual perversions, bold artistic choices and personal captives, but i was disappointed. mostly because of the story-telling approach, the film was so occupied with trying to surprise us through somewhat clumsy plot twists, a number of unfilled characters and unnecessary little loose ends leading to an elementary message. the problem was that Almodovar tried to make it a horror in his own way; incorporating a mad scientist, body parts, vendetta and betrayal. i just think it's an uneven mixture. however, i liked the acting, the music and set design a lot. i wouldn't really recommend it but who knows, you might just like it",negative
"From the mind of one of Spain premier film director, Pedro Almodovar, is The Skin I Live In, a very compelling and interesting psychological thriller that oozes style and themes that will keep you engrossed throughout.Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) is a skilled plastic surgeon who is attempting to make a synthetic skin that is tougher then nature human skin, with the hope that it would cure burn injuries and stop malaria. At his remote home/clinic he has only one patient, Vera (Elena Anaya) who uses as a guinea pig and keeps her under lock and key. Robert is also a man who has had pain in his life, his wife had server burns and commits suicide and so does his daughter Norma (Blanca Suarez). Soon the film explores how the strange relationship between Robert and Vera began.The Skin I Live In is film filled with twists and turns and goes in many different directions, from being a medical/psychological mystery to turning into a twisted revenge film. Almodovar uses a non-linear narrative, with the first and final thirds are set in the present and the middle made as a flashback and the director is able to bring all these elements together by the end. The Skin I Live In starts as a film that seems to be asking medical ethics questions about what is it right to do morally dubious acts, to an examination of sexual obsession and violence and to the forming an elaborate revenge scheme which results in a body shock, Stockholm syndrome and sexual and personal identity. The only other Almodovar film I have seen was Bad Education and there are similar ideas of sexual identity and sexual violence and also uses a non-linear style, but I preferred The Skin I Live In.The characters are all morally dubious, with complex issues and background. There is a lot of ambiguity with all of them. The Skin I Live In has a fantastic screenplay behind it as it brings out all these moral ambiguities and themes to great effect and Almodovar was able to direct it with the right amount of pacing and there was tension throughout. There are some great camera and visual tricks and there Almodvar has no holds bars to sex and violence and it actually surprising it got a 15 rating when it could have easily gotten an 18.They is a strong cast with actors and Banderas has to show his range with his very complex role. Anaya is strong actress and a very attractive woman and there was no weak links. I like Suarez's performance as shy and sheltered girl who shows an interest in a young man and I loved her naivety, but I thought it was too comical when she is psychologically traumatised and hides in cupboard: it just felt over the top and silly and is one of the few weak links in the writing.There are plenty of twisted ideas throughout the film that will stick in your head, one of the main ones being Robert has been making Vera to look like his decreased wife and his unhealthy obsession as he watches her and slowing gives into his passions. But going any further would lead into spoilers.The Skin I Live In is a really engrossing film, a great blend of psychological drama and thriller with a real art-house approach to it. It is an inventive and original film that will hold your attention and keep you interested.",positive
"From a technical point of view this is a very polished product. The camera is good. The lighting is good. The costumes and furniture do work well together. In short, I'm talking about a very ornate shell of a rotten egg.The story is not what Almodovar used to do. Maybe it is because he moves from the realm of the let's call it known into the unknown. He used to tell the story of people around him, of the world where he was raised. And it was great. This one is about Almodovar's new age guru believes. From a study point of view this is a cheap sci fi story debating something already known to be unreal.As for the horror part, till I read the reviews I haven't noticed it. I still don't think this is horror. Maybe my sensitivity scale is messed. All I felt was boredom. And being cheated. Like in a silly Conan Doyle story details keep coming after the fact and every scene is explained afterwards. It might be thrilling for some in the audience, but that makes a second view as even duller.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",negative
"I hadn't seen a film by acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar for a long time (""Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown"" and ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"") and I really didn't know what to expect with one, but I accepted the recommendation of a friend who sees more foreign cinema than me. In fact, the less one know about this work in advance, the more one can savour the plot revelations and twists in this deliciously bizarre, even macabre, tale.Almodóvar may be gay but he loves beautiful women and has worked a lot with the likes of Penélope Cruz. Here his muse is the gorgeous Elena Anaya who is playing opposite the good- looking Antonio Banderas (who was in my two previous pieces from the Spanish director). It is a story about loss, revenge and above all identity, full of wonderful visual images, including a cocooned woman the like of which I have not seen since the Ken Russell bio-pic ""Mahler"" in 1974.",negative
"Almodovar takes the stuff of horror films and sculpts a grand twisted melodrama out of it. There is a mad doctor. There is unnecessary surgery. There are attempts to both make up for the past and to avenge past deeds through experimentation on unwilling subjects. There is the creation of a new person from the remains of an old one. All this stuff borrowed from ""Eyes Without a Face"" and the dozens of variations on it from Jesus Franco among others is sculpted into one of Almodovar's grand labyrinthine plots full of deception and high emotion. This film is scientifically designed for me to love.",positive
"One thing I must say is that Antonio Banderas hasn't been as interesting as in his native Spaniard form, you can tell he's become a humble actor who has learned the hard way that a pretty face doesn't necessarily go a long way in Hollywood (well, maybe a little) and I was glad to see the actor reunite with the director that catapulted his film career with classic films as Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, Matador among others. Heck, he should have asked Penelope Cruz who has been faithful to Pedro Almodóvar all along which brought her to a respectable status in Hollywood (and in much better roles than Antonio's poor Hollywood choices: anyone remembers him in Assassins? Or Spy Kids 3D?) There are some parts of The Skin That I Live In that seem to hint at a classic horror movie, or a film noir, even a comedy (a laugh or two is always welcome in such a film full of tense moments). Did he try to make this a comedy, a drama, a horror story? The best way to ever describe it is: it's a Pedro Almodóvar film. Deal with it. Punto y aparte.This is a small excerpt from my full review at ITALO'S CORNER. It contains spoilers so read with caution but I recommend seeing The Skin first...",positive
"Really liked how director Pedro Almodovar was able to mix different genres and able to make something that is both fascinating and disturbing. This film really caught my attention with the amount of detail that the director has provided, along with bringing a great amount of elements that really made me enjoy this film.One of the major things I care about most in film is plot and I really liked how the film was structured as it starts off as one way and reveals a truth that I did not expect, in which genuinely surprised me. The whole time you are filled with questions and are just wondering what in the world is going on. It is weird, but yet I couldn't help but feel intrigued. Then, as the film continues on, I started to see what was going on and I was blown away by the twist. Once you figure out what was going on, then you start to wonder what the film would do next and personally, it did not disappoint. I do like the fact that when you look back on the film, you can see the subtle hints that were sprinkled around and it never felt like the surprise came out of left field.Also, the directing, along with the cinematography was pretty good here. I liked how the director structured each shot and I really appreciate everything that I saw in the film. From the lighting to where he positioned the camera, I really liked every detail that he provided here and did like his craft a lot.The performances were absolutely great. Antonio Banderas did a fantastic job here as he was able to deliver a performance of a character who has layers to him and provided enough depth for us to somewhat understand the mindset of the character. I do like that he is not playing the typical tough guy that he tends to play and it is a role that I haven't personally seen him play. Also, I thought Elena Anaya did a great job here as Vera. I won't give much about her, but she brought the necessary emotion to the character and gave a strong performance as well.You do have to be patient with this film as you start not knowing what is going on, but will be more intrigued, along with questioning yourself on the morality of what is going on here. There were so many great things about this film, I do recommend to people who do enjoy twisted movies.",positive
"A truly bizarre film with a distinctive style, an awesome soundtrack and a superb structure that skilfully reveals the ambitious story bit by bit. Like Black Swan, it revels in its insanity, to awe-inspiring effect. Every shot is artfully composed and the film looks fantastic. It's worth seeing in as high quality an environment as possible (I saw it in the Curzon Soho, which fit the bill beautifully).It is not always comfortable to watch, nor is it totally uncontroversial: there is a theme of rape, and none of the characters are morally clear-cut. I think it's pushing the boundaries of a 15 certificate (in the UK); an 18 may have been more appropriate.The film feels a little cold and detached at times, but there is also an absurd and humorous thread throughout. However, the acting is good and it is easy to empathise with all the characters throughout the twists and turns.Every element of this original film is handled with the utmost skill and confidence. I need to check out more of Almodóvar's work. In the meantime, both the film and the (by turns) jazzy, pumping and squirmy violin/piano soundtrack will be going on my 'to buy' lists. Highly recommended.",positive
"The Skin I Live In would possibly be even more cold and disturbingly off-the-charts as far as where it goes to if not for a news story this past week involving a convicted rapist on the Stanford University campus, Brock Turner. I couldn't help but think about him while watching this movie, and it had to do with how we view victims and predators. There's not much, if any, sympathy or perhaps empathy for Turner (outside of, on the opposite side, perhaps, Turner's father who brought a lot of ire through his own comments, look them up if you're reading this long after the fact), and this is in large part thanks to the fact that the man was tried and convicted and that the victim (still leaving herself unnamed) had a heartfelt and harrowing description in court about her ordeal. And yet at the end of the day the conversation turned to how unfair it was that Turner only got 6 months in jail (out in 3). Some might say prison is still prison. But is it? How do we judge punishment? Or, for that matter, revenge, or justice? Tough questions all around, and asking how you feel is different depending on the person.This movie deep down deals with questions like this in a way that is about as honest as Almodovar can get, and yet it's all in the framing of a full-boned genre picture. This isn't expected from a director who in the 21st century has made mostly dramas involving women in melodramatic and often (deliriously/ravishingly) high-volume situations as far as where it goes to. Sometimes this can lead to camp. This is a case where Almodovar is out to be serious as he can be, and in its way it lends itself to body science fiction and horror (one might want to reach out to Cronenberg, but the one that I, as many other critics, go back to is Franju's Eyes Without a Face, also about recreating a loved one through the power of the outside).It's a story that, in the best compliment I can pay the film, does tell a full *story*, not simply a situation. How it tells it may be questionable in that it doubles back in time for a large portion of it when, one wonders, if it was told in a straightforward manner if it would show more of the logical gaps. Clearly it's meant to build up the mystery and intrigue of the first act: a woman is in a room that she can't get out of, being held by a doctor running experiments on her skin (Elena Anaya and Antonio Banderas respectively), as he's on the cusp of a great-new-big discovery involving a new form of skin that can block mosquitoes and whatnot. But who *is* she? There's one piece of (odd) almost comedy that is actually rather dark and terrifying thriller-drama territory near the end-of-act-1 mark involving a character in (no joke) a tiger costume. Other than that, this is the most serious I've seen Almodovar, where he treats all of this with the somber tone that Hitchcock brought to something like Vertigo, only there's a coldness to much of the film (at least the first and third parts) that it almost becomes kind of suffocating.This isn't to decry the performances though as the two leads are astounding. Really, they dig in to these characters and of course any woman worth her salt as an actress in an Almodovar film comes off better than in 10 other movies. What it comes down to is... well, what there is dramatically, I don't mean philosophically or morally one can read from the themes, aside from the surface shocks: when we flash back we find out that the doctor's daughter was sexually assaulted by a young man (there's actually two sexual assaults in the film, fairly graphic, and perhaps in Almodovar's mind one shouldn't shy away from showing it sometimes, fair enough), and the doctor got his form of revenge by kidnapping the guy as his daughter went insane and killed herself (this is following the death of her mother, the doctor's wife, this told in a clunky bit of exposition made to be 'deep' as it's over a fire)... but it goes from one thing to another until... well, you ever see Oldboy? It's that kind of f***ed-up reveal, if you can catch my drift by now.So I do think that there are things to think about, real legitimate real-world effects, of what Almodovar brings up here, even extending into, arguably, what it means to be transgender - what if it happens to be not some joyous occasion but a horrific nightmare without escape? I think all of the ideas are in place and how everything is shot and designed is spot on. But the emotion feels drained somehow, like it should be less dark and depressing and a little more, well, crazy tiger-costume-man. It IS a full-on Almodovar film, and a misfire by him is still a helluva lot more intriguing and aesthetically satisfying (and of course truly sexy) than many other films in the past several years, but a misfire nonetheless.",negative
"""What was it that bothered me so much?"" the movie that makes you ask. yes, what bothers us so much in the movie? Is it to intervene in someone's body without their consent, or is it more - again forcibly - changing the sexual character of one's body?Three people seem to interfere with someone's body without their consent: first the maniac at the beginning of the movie, and the second the boy trying to take advantage of the psychologically troubled girl. and the third is, of course, the doctor. But I think this is the third reason why the movie is a mess, especially for men. Especially the rape at the beginning of the film becomes an unbearable violence after reaching the knowledge of the third intervention.I think the main goal of all this dizzying fiction is to reveal which side the violence and power in straight sexuality is working on. No matter how harrowing a rape scene is (eg irreversible), the destructive power in the body is not as great. Whereas, the loss of manhood, the turning of violence against its owner, creates such a damage that perhaps no similar intervention can come close.On the other hand, the technical competence of the film should also be mentioned, this is today's dr. Frankenstein and his house are so elaborately crafted that it is impossible for a man to turn into such a perfect woman. really successful. It is certain that pedro almadovar is a true master, but it seems as if he is getting more and more technically competent.",positive
"A daunting incompetence of fulfillment from an Almodóvar film is palatable after watching his latest uncannily B-movie skin-alteration thriller. The film has been persistently absorbing to its viewers from A to Z, thanks to a non-linear narration fashion (like BROKEN EMBRACES 2009, an 8/10 rating), a tantalizingly lurid color palette, a magnificently orchestrated score, and a brilliant cast. So where the incompetent sentiment exactly originates from? The unimaginative dialogues (outsiders' trashy talking in an imitated bio-medical clique) and an inexplicable why-they-do- that exposition throttles the consummation of a full-blown frisson, a few question marks lingering abidingly (e.g. Vera's character's initial response to the operation is bizarrely understated).As an Almodóvar-tagged film, a nub of identity confusion is more blatant and visually aggressive this time, often the camera deftly pans out and renders enough space and time for miniature details, the noir-accessorized surroundings, including the chilling glass lab, the monitored room and a youngsters' night orgy on the grass, not to mention the inside decoration of doctor's villa, plain Almodóvaresque! Antonio Banderas leads a protean Spanish cast, Elena Anaya, a stand-in for the pregnant Penélope Cruz is breathtaking not only for her physique contour (if there is no double), but in the subtle inner revelation of her character as well (although a bit underdeveloped due to the inept script). Almodóvar's longtime collaborator Marisa Paredes and the newcomer Jan Cornet are both radiating great forms in their screen time.Almodóvar is still one of my favorite directors nowadays, maybe TSILI fails to live up to his vintage standard, but it is also auspicious for groupies to revel in his continuously extended output from other wackily diverting fields.",positive
"Only the fact that this is a trendy foreign language film can have saved this film from the universal panning it so richly deserves. Weak attempts at humor created nervous titters in an audience who came believing they were to see an intelligent artistic piece and instead were subjected to poor special effects, science fiction with no science and characters whose actions were bewildering and obscene at the same time. Moreover, significant story lines were opened and forgotten. It is an emperor's new clothes syndrome where a new foreign film from a big name is given credit when it deserves the biggest possible demerit. I'm in two minds as to whether I want more people to see the film and give it the poor reviews it deserves, or whether I want them to be saved from the waste of time and see something with merit.",negative
"This movie isn't nuanced or clever. It is violent misogyny, repulsive and horrific. So disappointed in Almadovar for creating this dangerous trash.",negative
"Stylishly made, but beware there's some pretty dark and twisted stuff here, with multiple rapes, suicides, imprisonment, and medical experimentation on a person. There was a point where I felt all this and the gratuitous nudity was too much, but as it played out and director Pedro Almodóvar revealed what was going on through an extended flashback, it came together reasonably well and was entertaining. I think the backstory involving the step-brother made the film unnecessarily convoluted in its first half, and added unnecessarily to the cringey stuff, vs. spending time on something interesting, like the psychological themes promised in the title. However, the biggest problem was how this doctor could possibly want to turn the person he would hate the most, into someone he loved, which defied all possible belief. The central premise and the various things bolted on thus seem too contrived, maybe because a more natural/sensical version would have come across as already having been done before. Entertaining but a bit commercial.",positive
"This movie is a trip. While I am certainly not the biggest fan of Almodovar, I have to admit, that his direction, the story he chose to make here, it all fits. And it is not for the squeamish or the faint-hearted either. This might upset people (though if they haven't learned about Almodovar yet, then it is their own fault I guess), but with the right mindset, it will get people ""excited"" too (no pun intended) ... Fear not though ... Or try not to! Antonio Banderas stretches his acting muscles and the beautiful Elena Anaya (watch Habitación en Roma if you haven't yet ... even if it's only for Elena) can prove there is more to her than her body (no pun intended). Writing anything about the story, will spoil the fun you'll have discovering all the little things that are going on by yourself. Watch and be amazed ...",positive
"The film starts very slowly, almost slow-motion. The line is not the easiest to divine. I guess I am not sufficiently sophisticated to appreciate the nuances of the plot but it seemed calculated to astound, or to horrify, rather than to entertain. The plot, such as it is, is more worthy of an old Boris Karloff movie. There are some titillating scenes but they lead nowhere. When it is finished, one wonders what one saw. There is no ""there"" there.We tend to light candles to famous names, or producers, or directors, without admitting that turkeys can fly their way, too. This is a gobbler!",negative
"Pedro Almodóvar has created so many superb surrealistic yet intensely human films that it s no surprise that he should enter the genre of horror stories. THE SKIN I LIVE IN (La piel que habito) takes us deep inside a terrifying concept and yet for all the potential for being a gore fest he manages to make it one of his finest explorations of the human psyche.Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) lives in a mansion with his servant: Marilla (Marisa Paredes) is the head of the household and happens to be Robert's mother as well - Roberto having been raised by the family for whom Marilla was working at the time the head of the household impregnated her. Robert is a plastic surgeon and has committed his teaching and research and creativity towards perfecting a type of skin that sustain fire, cuts, and insects, and despite the lack of backing of his prestigious colleagues to extend this work toward work with humans, Robert is working in secret in his home trying to devise a skin that would have helped his late wife severely burned in an auto accident. His patient in progress is Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) on whom Robert works day and night to perfect his 'invention' of perfect skin. In a typical Almodóvar move, a strange man in a tiger costume (for Carnival) arrives at Robert's home: Zeca (Roberto Álamo) is a criminal on the run, needs money, happens to be the other son of Marilla, and is the one responsible for the fiery accident that disfigured Robert's wife who subsequently committed suicide when after surviving the accident sees her own distorted image in a window and leaps to her death.The film takes us back six years to explain the events: Robert's daughter Norma (Blanca Suárez) has been hospitalized and medicated for mental illness since she observed her mother's suicide. But she goes to a party where she is desired by a young lad Vicente (Jan Cornet) and in the throes of drugs the two enter into an attempted sexual liaison that is discovered by Roberto. What happens after this is best left unsaid as the key to the terror of the film has begun and sharing more would deprive the viewer of the suspense and brilliance of the script.The story was adapted by Pedro Almodóvar and Agustín Almodóvar from a French novel 'Tarantula' by Thierry Jonquet, the phenomenal musical score was written by Alberto Iglesias, and the haunting cinematography is the work of José Luis Alcaine. Blessed with a cast of magnificent actors (Almodóvar's usual entourage plus more) Pedro Almodóvar directs this fascinating film to new heights, even for him. The story is complex and while it is bizarre in almost every aspect, it remains a film that explores the human psyche, the power of love, revenge, and the extremes seemingly ordinary people will go if motivated. It is a brilliant film that only grow better with repeated viewings. Grady Harp",positive
"The majority of this disjointed psychological thriller is enjoyable, but the fun stops pretty quickly. The first act of this film feels miss paced, speeding up at the wrong times and slowing down into this romantic affair at just plain odd times. But, what it does well is the added suspense that is implemented throughout this film. The entirety of the stories plan is never revealed until the end, giving you some motivation to way it out to discover what is really happening. The Skin I Live In does a mediocre job, in what could've have been such a fantastic classic. Whether it is the subtitles that took away the effects for the English viewer, or whether it was just slightly incoherent and ambitious, The Skin I Live In is nevertheless enthralling and suspenseful for its majority.",negative
"This one is going to keep me up for a while. For those who want the true viewing experience, please read nothing about it beforehand. Best to go in without any prior knowledge whatsoever because you will be dragged on an incredible journey.A horror film without gore but more effective than your average blood-and-guts movie, this film really digs deep into uncomfortable territory. A film begging to be analysed and talked about afterwards. Extraordinary filmmaking. Definitely keen to check out more of Almodovar's work.",positive
"Do you like avocados? Do you like escargots (snails)? As in those two cases, Almodovar films are an acquired taste. I was never able to force myself to try escargots, but I certainly like avocados and it goes without saying that I ADORE Almodovar films.This film is no exception, I enjoyed it very much although I found it so complicated that I'm considering a second view to fully grasp the whole thing.Technically everything is perfect, by now we've become accustomed and have taken for granted the incredible terseness of Almodovar productions, since the sets, costumes, lighting or whatever contributes to the making of his films are picture perfect.The storyline is something else, only Almodovar could come up with such convoluted story --fascinatingly convoluted-- where he shows us how a human being can gamble without any hesitation whatsoever with his physical sexual desires and love, tenderly, passionately, with either sex and no regrets or complexes will make a moral dent on him. Total uninhibited sexual freedom.Same way he shows us how an involuntary sex change can be traumatic at the very beginning but later on, as time passes, the ""victim"" becomes accustomed to it and continues living -- humans always adapt, if they don't commit suicide, to their present situation if they do not have possibilities for changing their destinies, as it happened to victims of concentration camps, enslavement or forced prostitution.Some reviewers found a total lack of humor in this movie, I found a few subtle moments of it, maybe because Spanish is my mother tongue and besides, after my many years as a resident in Spain, I understand (and adore) their incredible sense of humor: When Banderas character comes into the garden and throws the evidence of his crime in the open fire, Marisa Paredes character asks him ""Did you buried him?"", ""Yes"" says him, ""Did you pray for him?"" well..., this was too much, the murderer praying for his victim, this is Almodovar at his best.The end, the very last scene of this picture belongs in the anthology of movie making: ¡¡¡SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When Vera (Vicente) comes back and walks into his mother's shop looking not only very different from his previous self but now as a full blown woman, the salesgirl comes from the back room, where she was talking to Vicente's (Vera now) mother, she, of course, doesn't recognize Vicente when facing Vera (we must remember that this girl is a lesbian and when Vicente tried to seduce her at the beginning of the movie she rejected him, nicely but firmly) Vera (Vicente) explains to her what happened during those years he was absent when his mother comes in from the back room to see what is going on with this strange client and he simply says to her: ""I'm Vicente"". End of the movie.Wow! let me recover from the authentic emotional impact of that scene!!! We can figure different options for whatever will happen after this story ends here: Vicente liked the salesgirl very much when he was a man (his mind is still that of a heterosexual man even within a woman's body now and even after he had those frantic sexual encounters as the passive one with Marisa Paredes son and with the plastic surgeon for such a long time --years) so he must like her now as much as when he had a man's body, but the salesgirl is a lesbian, so if before she didn't care for Vicente, now she may very well care for Vera, because now he/she's a sensational brunette... His mother reaction? that I leave up to your own feverish imagination.",positive
"This film can best be described as a psychological thriller based on the criminally insane. The Skin I Live In is disturbing on many levels and one has to wonder about the moral ethics of our society. There is a bestiality about the characters in this film that makes the film depressing. You watch in horror with no sense of hope throughout the film. The damage done is irreversible and frightening.Antonio Banderas plays Robert Ledgard, a surgeon who takes a matter of revenge into his own hands and proceeds to use a human as a guinea pig to advance his research. It is not clear whether the film is about revenge for a crime committed against Ledgard's daughter, or about scientific research prompted by the horrific accident suffered by Ledgard's wife. The combination is utter madness and quite bizarre. Banderas is a fine piece of eye candy and a major selling point for this film, but in my opinion is miscast as the evil surgeon. He attempts to be emotionless and cold, however, there is a warmth about him as a human being that makes it difficult for the audience to hate him. Had another actor, such as a Spanish version of John Malkovich been cast in his role, I'm sure there would have been a higher level of emotion expressed by the audience towards this evil character. Elena Anaya is magic to watch as Vera Cruz. She works each scene to her advantage, mesmerising the audience with her beauty. Considering the mental state of the characters depicted in this film, the fact that she is able to remain so poised and calm in the diabolical situation she is imprisoned in, makes her character unbelievable. Not even a hint of madness. Surely the practice of yoga that she embraces to help her cope is not that powerful, especially for a novice. The Skin I Live In is masterfully directed by Pedro Almodóvar, Spain's most internationally acclaimed director. The story is an unnecessarily complex one with enough twists and turns to make your head spin. The loose ends are neatly tied together, unfortunately with predictability and the ending is too simplistic and convenient. A simpler storyline could have worked better and made the story more believable, and easier to digest. Eliminating unnecessary characters and subplots and having Vera raped by Robert would have had a bigger effect on the audience's feelings towards Robert. Having Robert's work colleague, Zeca begin to investigate Robert's illegal research at the beginning of the film would have created more tension throughout the movie, rather than have him appear towards the end of the film with his allegations, and then have the film end shortly after.The blending of two characters was completely unconvincing but the idea of the story was intriguing, and as I mentioned before, very disturbing. There is little explanation as to the insanity of Robert's daughter. She appears as a puppet in the film to serve a purpose and then is conveniently disposed of. Too much tragedy makes a heart grow cold. It's not a film you would want to watch again.All up, the film kept you squirming in your seat and although not a pleasant experience to watch, it certainly was different.",negative
I rated this film 9 instead of 8 because i liked Antonio Banderas in it and I liked the twist which covered up who was the woman. It was a bit slow but not boring film.,positive
"It's not very nice to watch, but it has a good story and good performances.",positive
"I am Spanish and a long time fan of Almodovar's oeuvre. Both things are important, I think, to understand his cinema and perceive it not as weird (like many other audiences from anywhere else) and bizarre, but as a clear portrait of the author's and his country's psyche. La piel que habito is much more of the first -dwelving in Almodovar's most recurrent wishdream- than the second- like most of his latest movies, this is not about our collective psyche, and I miss that Spanish flavor we found last in Volver, because it is wonderful to see your own world portrayed in such beautiful and deep way. We liked La piel que habito,mostly because of Alcaine's wonderful cinematography and Almodovar cinematic sense. The film is mostly a wonderful collection of fetishist images that the plot struggles to justify. I will mention just one small example: one of Vera's dresses, designed to protect her skin, has zippers under her breasts. To begin with, Vera's new skin is strong and flawlessly finished, but the tight jersey jumpsuit is beautiful, disturbing and sexy... but why the zippers? why does Vera needs zippers under her breasts? she doesn't, but the film does, for Zeca to open them, expose and suck Vera's breast through the zippers, thus creating a wonderful visual fetish. Zeca's character in disguise is another example, and all the film is, in my opinion, of Almodovar wanting to give us these wonderful visual moments. And we thank him for that. Most films nowadays are centered in the plot and dialogs, forgetting that cinema should be mostly about images. Almodovar's psyche, on the other hand, is in such powerful need of analysis and exploration that sometimes he gets carried away. The perfect transformation of gender, without any traces of its masculine side, to become the most perfect and feminine being, is the dream he seems to explore here. And he looses it, not minding that the two actors have nothing in common, not even their eyes, their teeth, the bony structure, nothing! -and that totally breaks suspension of disbelieve, and you really have to love Almodovar to bear with him and pretend you believe the story- but you don't, because it is unbelievable. In the same way, it is not plausible that Vicente becomes the most feminine woman in every sense (the way she moves, the voice!, how she behaves, etc) when he is psychologically masculine. Both these problems could have been easily solved (modest opinion!). The first, by using the same actress to play both parts,masculine and feminine (but of course this would not be the total, perfect transformation dreamed by Almodovoar). The second, by trying to justify it psychologically, through, for example, the Stocolm syndrome. But again, when Vera goes to his/her mother and tells her ""Soy Vicente"" (I am Vicente)is the perfect moment. And he wouldn't spoil that for anything. It is sad, when I've just watched one of my favorite's new films, because that means we'll have to wait again two years for his next one, specially when you realize it is good, but it is not perfect as many of his films are... so we will wait... for Mina.",positive
"OK, I have many many problems with this movie. I will start with the problems that do not involve the ideas in the movie. 1. Almodovar tries to start the story at the middle and fails miserably 2. The doctors says: We managed to use genetic engineering for plants and animals and why do we not try on humans? Well first of all the GMO organisms are advantageous only for the person that sells them for profit. Someone that consumes them will find no nutritional value, high probability of serious disease, and nothing that tastes like food. Also those animals either destroy all other similar species (plants case) and insects which are required for pollination which in turn destroys them, either they cannot even survive without large amounts of antibiotics pumped daily in their system. Also there are clear laws against using GMO on humans. 3. They are technologies for replacing and regenerating skin much more simpler than that. Just Look at Michael Jackson 4. Falling from less than Lev 4 of a building will not kill you, many times you wont even get a broken leg. 5. Without hormonal treatment a man that had sex replacement surgery will grow a mustache and beard; also the voice does not change depending on the quantity of testosterone in the blood. 6. Musquitos can sting pigs! 7. In the end Vera\Vincente shots two persons and kills them instantly although she does not hit the heart in one case. Also you can survive a bullet to the heart in most cases. 8. The body costume is stupid at best and useless.Now the ideas. First idea is that most men are just sex hungry animals- a bit insulting ladies. The second is that the other half are obsessive compulsive psychopaths, so you better avoid nice guys-Nice idea Mr! Then the fact that he takes thing to far. I understand cutting the guys balls off, the torture and even the operation but everything after that is baffling. Also the most baffling is that he starts to love his creation and f**** her.... So unless you are a hard core feminist or completely oblivious to everything around you you will not like this movie.",negative
"Unsettling shocker from master filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar stars Antonio Banderas (reunited with the director after two decades) as a disturbed surgeon (responsible for developing a special kind of skin for burn victims and those needing reconstruction) holding a ""human surgical experiment"" (Elena Anaya) imprisoned in a room in his mansion. Despite attempts to escape, she remains trapped, awaiting the opportunity to escape. There's more to Anaya's story than meets the eye, and we learn a truly warped backstory behind how she got here. It involves Banderas' mentally unstable daughter, heavily medicated, given permission by her doctors at an institution/clinic to socialize (to better her mental well being, and perhaps rehabilitate her), and a young man she meets at a heavily populated shindig held by his mother (who owns a clothing boutique). Banderas believes she was raped when he discovers her body unconscious as her supposed attacker drives off on his motorcycle, but upon further elaboration this incident was a seemingly consensual encounter disrupted by an awakening of her mania. The twist involving how Anaya ""came about"" is truly unnerving and Banderas' reasoning—at first out of revenge when his daughter leaped from a window after believing her father was the one who raped her, later becoming an infatuation when Anaya begins to resemble Banderas' wife through the power of reconstructive surgery—becomes askew.If this film was directed by just about anyone else other than Almodóvar, ""The Skin I Live In"", with subject matter fit for ""Movie 43"", could have not been taken seriously. With a straight face and a serious approach, despite some rather melodramatic elements (the maid who helped raise Banderas was actually his mother, used as a surrogate for the affluent parents who were unable to have children (because the wife was infertile), later helping him conceal Anaya and the sick secret regarding her ""transformation"", the maid's ""other son"", after robbing a bank, ""inviting himself"" into Banderas' home and forcing himself on Anaya (he also had an affair with Banderas' wife (!) who also committed suicide after severe burns from a car crash left her scarred physically and emotionally), and the whole ""gender reconstruction"" that leaves quite the bad taste) par for the course in a Almodóvar film, ""The Skin I Live In"" doesn't fall under the weight of the absurdities of human behavior so inherent in the characters that populate it. That final scene where Anaya goes into the clothing store is quite compelling due to where she once was, what she has been through, and a future that leaves her forever ""changed"" in more ways than onebut at least a mother has answers the police seemed unable to provide. Banderas is chilling in performance, with a character seriously troubledit comments on an obsession that becomes sociopathic, using his talents with the knife (those assisting him believe the surgery is voluntary with the patient compliant, not knowing it is an act of revenge that evolves / elevates / escalates into something far more twisted) in ways that are morally reprehensible.",positive
"It's one of the sickest movies I've seen, no doubts about that, and I don't even want to know what other twisted things fly around Almodovar's brain, but other than that, I didn't find it to be great at all. Almodovar likes putting out controversial and provoking story lines, there's no surprise about that, and he generally manages to deliver a solid experience. This time around, though, I kind of felt that the movie was only standing by its sick and controversial main subject, and all the other things were just hanging apart. Well, for me it wasn't enough, I think there's lack of development on both the story and the characters, and by the time I guessed what was happening, I was also able to predict the end of it. In the end, felt predictable and hollow, but managed to keep me there watching, just to confirm that what I thought was going to happen, effectively happened. However, this movie is interesting for those like me who already forgot that Antonio Banderas can be a good actor, if he doesn't occupy half of his brain on getting the English accent right. When the guy feels free to express himself in his mother tongue, then he delivers (just like Penelope Cruz), and this is the case.",negative
"It would take a remarkable director like Almodovar to bring together a touch of ""Vertigo"" and mix it with ""Psycho"" and ""Frankestein"" and somehow give you a love story of the strangest kind. Even if you have seen most of Almodovar's recent and one of his earliest films, you will not be ready for some of the plot twists and imagery Almodovar has orchestrated for his latest.A very gifted plastic surgeon has come up with new technology to help people reconstruct damaged portion of their body. He is in demand, and we're introduced to his gifts early in the movie, as he lectures and demonstrates his talents. In a daring and unconventional way, the drama is introduced in the middle, and like Lynch, the trip will be tinted by mind tricks, pharmaceutical assistance, and a touch of Almodovar's imagination. There is some fascinating logic at work here, but be ready to surrender and open your mind because almost anything goes here.As Robert (Banderas) tries to heal the wounds of some traumatic incidents in his past, he discovers that playing God will certainly meet with some disturbing results. At the beginning of the film, he is treating a disturbed female patient in his private facilities. We know she has suicidal tendencies, and she must be handled with extreme care. Little by little we discover the origin of her trauma and her true relationship with her doctor.Soon, we are in full Almodovorean mode, and some of usual denizens make an appearance in order to propel the amazing plot forward and backward. It suddenly feels like one is in an adult Wonderland, and we are seeing everything through Alice's eyes, not quite believing how the whole thing came together. It is a daring film, and its plethora of attempts to be different might feel overwhelming at first, shocking you at first, and not allowing you to appreciate the complexity of the plot until the film ends. It is definitely not straightforward and simple in its approach; it just contains an amazing number of the usual themes: love, passion loss, obsession, revenge, and somehow they all work well together.Revealing more about the eventual turn of events would be a disservice to the structure and surprises in the movie. Just keep in mind, three very talented performers are at their best, and Almodovar manages to find new ways to reinvent the potential of cinema and to show us what made him special.",negative
"THE SKIN I LIVE IN (2011) **1/2 Antonio Banderas, Elena Anaya, Marisa Peredes, Jan Cornet, Roberto Alamo, Barbara Lenni, Susi Sanchez. Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's latest examination of sexual politicas is a doozy: mad doctor Banderas (the 'other' muse of the director, in a return-to-form performance) whose obsession – literally – with a new synthetic skin experiment upon a very unusual case patient – the young man who raped his daughter! – is driven to his insanity. Almodovar provides the usual melodramatics with echoes of ""EYES WITHOUT A FACE"" and 'flesh for fantasy' auteurs Cronenberg, Lynch, Hitchcock and any Univision telenovella may have gone too far in its agent provocateur of aforementioned rape, sexual mores, borderline torture porn and good old fashioned mind-f#*#ing.

An absolute must see intriguing thriller. Genuinely unsettling at times but impossible to look away. Antonio Banderas gets to show us how well he can tackle a disturbing and dramatic role. You'll be so immersed in the story and it's hypnotic visuals that you won't even notice that it's in Spanish,positive
"Pedro Almodovar films are always an adventure! We never know where his films will take us... always some strange habit or emotion of the protagonist; his usual star Antonio Banderas is Ledgard, a scientist, trying to perfect the skin that cannot be damaged by injury or fire. Co-stars Elena Anaya and Marisa Paredes, who also worked with Almodovar before on multiple films. This one has nudity, sex, violence, and murder, so not for the little ones! When the other scientists protest that his work crosses the line of ethics and propriety, Ledgard ignores them. And he still talks to his long-gone wife, who is the real reason he's working on a tougher skin. When someone harms his daughter, Ledgard makes the perp pay. And pay. And pay. A social worker's grab bag of emotional issues. And all the family secrets come out, as in a good Almodovar film! Who is Zeca, the tiger man, really? So much pain and sorrow, yet Almodovar always manages to include fun and quirky people and situations into his films. Based on the novel by Thierry Jonquet.",positive
"This was definitely not the film I was expecting to watch based on the blurb. If you want a film focused on plastic surgery or super-strong skin inventions, this film isn't it. However, if you're interested in unusual plot twists that mess with your head and slightly excessive sex scenes, it might be more up your street.Overall, not the film I sat down to watch, but oddly enjoyable nonetheless.",positive
"The most interesting thing about Almodóvar's new film is how polarizing the reviews I read on IMDb are. It's his best film. His worst film. It's horror. It's definitely not horror. The only thing most people can agree on is the fluidity of the camera-work by Jose Luis Alcaine. In one scene, Marilia (Marisa Paredes) runs through the room at a sideways angle that confirms the urgency of the scene, in addition to being innovative and beautiful.Perhaps this is Almodóvar's most unusual film. Oddly enough, the film takes place in the not so distant future (2012) and the not so far off past (six years ago). The comparisons to Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face are not unjustified. Both girls, La piel's Vera and Eyes' Christiane, both wear strange and practically identical masks. Also, each film features a father that over obsesses about the well-being of his daughter who has been damaged.However, never once did I feel that this was a horror film. It has tension and suspense; at times it is hard to watch because of the subject matter. I wouldn't be perplexed if someone thought this was a horror film, but I would describe it more along the lines of thriller and drama. The music set the mood, which wasn't as scary or kitschy as something you would expect from a horror film. It also did not go for cheap thrills.Similarities to Almodóvar's other work pervade his film. Like in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Talk to Her, Broken Embraces, Bad Education, and Volver, there is rape. There are so many rape scenes and replayings of the rape of Norma in La piel, that one almost loses count. Yet it is strange how Vicente's rape of Norma (Blanca Suárez) could be interpreted. Her faulty last- minute ""no"" almost leaves you wondering if the audience is meant to sympathize with the rapist and if the victim should have protested sooner. All of this is very delicate subject matter that Almodóvar tears wide open.The movie will be discussed in detail and there might be spoilers below:Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) plays a scientist that decides to take revenge on Vicente. He abducts him and with the help of his associates (who are none the wiser), Ledgard performs a sex-change operation on Vicente, who becomes Vera.Vera defies her captors and tries to escape at the first chance she gets. Eventually, she becomes domiciled, almost tame. Perhaps the audience might believe she has been struck with Stockholm Syndrome when she begs to share Dr. Ledgard's room with him. But perhaps this is the reverse of Stockholm Syndrome: Dr. Ledgard hated Vicente for what he did to his daughter and kept him in a locked room. Instead of Vicente now Vera, falling in love with him, the actual captor, Dr. Ledgard, seems to be the one falling for his captive.By the end of the film, we are faced once again with sympathizing with Vicente, the rapist, the original offender. His life has been unjustifiably transformed and he is now Vera. The audience might be left feeling uncomfortable. Dr. Ledgard took irreversible measures and now Vicente must regain his life back as Vera. Can she? Will she? Vera was as emotionally strong as Norma was not. It seems as if Vera will make a new start and move on with her life, because she has the survival instinct and refuses to let this traumatic stint in her life keep her from living. http://www.cinemabecomesher.com",negative
"Almodovar's last two entries, ""Volver"" (""Return"") and ""Abrazos Rotos"" (""Broken Embraces"") were criticized by some long-time fans and critics alike as being too pedestrian and mainstream as supposed to the usual fare from the Spanish cinema maestro, one that is steeped in surrealism and even magical realism at times.I for one couldn't disagree more, the movies I mentioned are amongst my favourites in his illustrious body of work. Penelope Cruz really shines in both and proves what a good actress she can be when working with someone who recognizes her talent.Such is also the case of Antonio Banderas, who gives one of his best performances in years, an Oscar-worthy one at that. Paired with his original accomplice, Almodovar and Banderas offer-up another great movie.""La Piel Que Habito"" (""The Skin I Live In"") finds, I guess to the relief of his hard-core supporters, Almodovar threading back into familiar territory, with a wonderfully deranged and strange tale of revenge, obsession, lust and the unexpected.With his usual golden touch, Almodovar creates another work of sublimely disturbing beauty. I don't know if this movie makes for repeat viewing given the heady subject matter and complex plot, but I found myself mesmerized while watching it.Another sweet slice of Almodovar served up...definitely recommended!",positive
"Beautiful. Cruel. And precise. Exercise of pain definition and science to build a story in many nuances. To create stories as parts of a cloth. An Almodovar, off course, but more classic. Maybe, for tell Pygmalion story, it is necessary an old recipes.But the ingredients are same and that is important. For atmosphere and for final strange happy end. For the pieces of unique statue. For the strange and enticing hypothesis.In fact, tale about love and hate. At different levels. About another doctor Frankenstein and oppression of past. About cure for old events and ambition of a scientist for who revenge is good instrument. A slice of way to solve crisis. A game in which role of victim is ambiguous. And a precious cast. That is all!",negative

"In a story told without a strictly linear fashion elements of the puzzle slowly unfold, forming a captivating structural mystery which starts from typical Almodovar awkward soap opera, but swings moods to something almost subversively horrific until finally becoming one of Almodovar's more contemplative features. A brilliant surgeon Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) seeks innovation through the creation of new skin, one which seamlessly becomes one with the flesh. He does however hide secrets between his idyllic lifestyle, as he experiments with his skin graft on the young and beautiful Vera (Elena Anaya). From this point the story unravels slowly, but surprisingly sifting in the true extent of the relationship between Vera and Robert.Not prone to easily admit admiration with Pedro Almodovar's work, as his soapish sensitivity is too distracting and self-encapsulating, which makes it feel like he is ridiculing the same joke to oblivion and ultimately delivering features, which for me personally are unanimously unmemorable. Nonetheless ""The Skin I Live In"" caught me by surprise, meticulously building a subversive story with layered revelations and a captivating finale, which is bound to bring about hints of inspiration of Cronenberg leitmotifs (in true body horror fashion). Delving into a maddening spiral of revenge comes a surprisingly wicked tale, which outdoes most contemporary horrors in effect factor.Nonetheless as usual Almodovar does seem a bit trite underneath the story with his attempt to portray sex and sexual drive as something purely situational, open to being molded to change, unconvincing and contrived. Almodovar introduces yoga as a form of connecting with the inner self, the person behind the skin, thus allowing to drop the external 'face' which bounds us and immerse into the body. This offers the character of Vera escape, a certain freedom, despite the layers of bondage (both physical in the form of locked doors as well as the face she is forced to wear). Lacking the same intellectual subtlety of Cronenberg's best work, ""The Skin I Live In"" however delivers most of its message head-on, without much integrity behind it, instead laden with a heavy layer of melodrama. Nonetheless the thrilling dramatic pull of the events as they transpire make the movie a true treat in its own right, regardless of whether or not the 'artistic' side of the story delivers.",positive

"I'm back on Spanish films courtesy of Almodóvar. Robert (Antonio Banderas) is a surgeon. A plastic surgeon. A rather good one by all accounts, if not brilliant and potentially a little crazy. We quickly learn that he's created a new artificial skin, one resistant to burns and insect bites. Only problem is, his methods aren't exactly ethical. Using pig cells to mutate human. That's not the only unusual aspect of Robert's world. The other is Vera, his secret test subject (Elena Anaya) who lives locked in his home surgery, wearing nothing but a heavy nylon tan coloured bodysuit. She's a personal project. Driven by the death of his wife, but the secrecy is hiding more than the piggy cells, there's a lot more to the back story. Almodóvar likes to lay it on thick and this is no exception, as details of Robert's family emerge, with characters true relations revealed and half brothers dressed as tigers. The groundwork is being laid, even if large sections of it will be rendered redundant. It's a tragic story. Infidelity, car crashes and suicides. If Robert wasn't nuts to begin with, these things certainly explain how he's come to be who he is. An obsessive opium smoking Frankenstein. It feels a bit convoluted, but the structure holds together as we delve further into Robert's past. We learn of Robert's daughter Norma's problems, after her mother's accident, then compounded by a rape attack. The attacker is a young pill popping Vincente. Who soon finds himself chained up by a revengeful Robert. Of course, we know he's gonna end up on the surgeons table, as the two quite separate parts of this narrative smash together. At its simplest, it's a twisted revenge thriller, but at its core... well it's a twisted revenge thriller. That's not to say it's bad, I kinda enjoyed it, but it's not easy to connect to and does feel a bit overblown considering the simple premise. The cast though are largely pretty good and even though it peters out with a slightly pointless coda I'd still recommend watching if you like Almodòvar's other work.",negative
"'The Skin I Live In (2011)' is somewhat problematic in the sense that it presents something as body horror which, without narrative complexities, really oughtn't to be portrayed as such. Luckily, it makes a point of not really being about that thing (I'm being very vague so as to avoid spoilers) but rather a purely surface element associated with it. Besides, Almodóvar has a strong track record with the subject; I doubt there was even a hint of ill-intention on his part, which doesn't so much as invalidate the criticisms one can levy at the piece as, I suppose, soften their impact on the overall experience. Basically, I can understand why some people would be thoroughly put off of the picture because of its iffy handling of the subject in question (it certainly doesn't sit quite right with me), but I can also see how others would be able to look past it (which, I think, I can also do). It's hard to properly explain without completely ruining a large portion of the plot; hopefully I've been able to explore it in such a way that makes sense no matter if you've actually seen the thing or not (it will certainly make more sense if you have, though.) At its core, the film is a horror that explores themes of revenge, isolation, psychopathy and identity. It's well-made and distinct, generally succeeding at getting under your skin. It is, in general, rather entertaining and it has a strong visual design, too. However, it isn't among its director's strongest work. It meanders somewhat in the middle, stumbles over some of its themes and features an odd aside relatively early on that seems straight out of a separate movie. Banderas' character is an enigma but not in a necessarily successful way; though we understand why he wants to do certain things, we don't understand why he wants to do them in the way that he does (again, I'm being vague on purpose, as the circumstances surrounding the flick's initial equilibrium are a large part of its mystery). He isn't particularly scary even though he's incredibly cruel. The movie ends in perhaps the only way it ever could have. It's a relatively satisfying ending but it isn't exactly unexpected. Still, the journey to get there is unique and diverting. Though it doesn't always completely explore its interesting ideas, the fact that they're there is appreciated. In the end, the film is uneven yet enjoyable. It's difficult to discuss without completely ruining its plot, so it's one of those movies you just have to see for yourself. 7/10",positive
"Pedro Almodovar's latest offering is a bizarre, complex thriller which could also be the first of its kind for the talented Spanish filmmaker. Almodovar essentially combines the soap operatic elements of his earlier films like ""Broken Embraces"" replete with characters with dark secrets, tragedies of the past that can't let go, severed blood ties, trauma, etc with a touch of Michael Crichton-ish medical thriller elements! Nonetheless, the outcome is a surprisingly original film to grace this reviewer's movie watch-list in a long, long time! In Toledo, Spain, Plastic surgeon Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) has had a brilliant breakthrough in creating an artificial skin tougher than normal human skin. It is the kind of skin that is resistant to mosquito bites and burns. We learn later, that an incident of the past has made this research of his almost an obsession for him. While Ledgard claims that he has been experimenting with athymic mice, it becomes clear that his guinea pig is actually human, a beautiful girl, Vera (Elena Anaya) who has been confined to a private chamber in his secluded estate where he resides with his elderly maid servant, Marilia (Marisa Paredes) who has been with the Ledgards since Robert was a child. Vera is monitored through various Closed-circuit TVs by Robert and it seems that she has been there for a long time now. She is provided food and supplies through a dumbwaiter but is never allowed out of her room. This place also serves as a center for research and operations hence there is limited or no access to outsiders, barring some of Robert's professional colleagues for specified purposes only. Life goes on and this status quo is disturbed one day, when Marilia's long estranged son Zeca (Roberto Alamo) suddenly shows up at their door .Loosely based on Thierry Jonquet's novel, ""Tarantula"", Almodovar's screenplay is magnificent in the manner in which he slowly unfolds the various layers of his twisted story, divulging information to his audiences only as required, in a carefully constructed non-linear narrative. What starts out like a conventional thriller in the first half, gradually melds into a nuanced drama laced with tragedy and subtle emotions. Instead of relying on jump twist endings that sometimes seem forced, Almodovar, in the film's runtime of 120 minutes, progressively 'builds' the story, by in fact, peeling the 'skin' off the package and unraveling the mystery within, little by little. In some back stories and subplots we are introduced to some more characters and it is at this point that the film actually gets its Pedro Almodovar feel! One may feel that the director is going off-track with these random introductions, but do not be fooled, for trust Almodovar to stay focused and not digress from the plot at any cost! There are absolutely no wasted moments or scenes as ultimately it all falls into place beautifully! Not all the characters are fully developed but those who do matter the most are, to a considerable extent; if not through elaborately written scenes, definitely through some back stories provided in flashback monologues.""The Skin I Live in"" is also an actors' film. Antonio Banderas in a never before seen avatar is a revelation; so amazing is his presence, he pulls off a challenging lead role with finesse as the dynamics of his character are revealed to the audience as the story moves forward. Ditto for Elena Anaya who has already established her status as a solid actress in the Spanish film world. It's a spectacular performance, the greatness of which is more evident in the latter half of the film. The supporting actors are not far behind, with some noteworthy performances by actors Blanca Suarez, Jan Cornet and Almodovar regular Marisa Paredes as the loyal maid servant Marilia, tormented by a dark secret of her own! ""The Skin I Live In"" is a riveting thrilleran almost Shakespearean tragedy with a macabre twist. Pedro Almodovar made one of the finest films of his career and also one of the best films of 2011. It is likely to stay in your mind for a long time after it is over the kind of film that can get under your 'skin'... literally! Score: 10/10.",positive
"Pedro Almodóvar's The Skin I Live In (La piel que habito) possesses bizarre, disturbing, and beautiful traits that are all rolled into one film that is a work of divine art. There is so much in the film, as it merges genres, invites different subplots in, invokes debate, and disrupts conventional movie timelines that, by casual assumption, should dismantle its impact or have its effect crushed by ambition. And yet, those qualities make it masterful and poignant all the more. There is a daunting way Almodóvar captures obsession and career-consumption, and needless to say, it's consuming in itself.It all begins with Antonio Banderas' simply electrifying performance as Dr. Robert Ledgard. Banderas knows how to liven any scene with his frightening charisma and chilling vibe, and here, he never makes a wrong move in a complex, deeply layered role. His character is a brilliant, persistent plastic surgeon, in the mix of developing a new type of skin that can resist burns and insect bites. He lives in a lavish mansion, teaching classes on anatomy, and living a seemingly quiet life, mostly closeting his ambition and drive for scientific discovery. One of the people he is experimenting on is an attractive young woman named Vera (Elena Anaya), who we see becomes engrossed in the thought of continuing/reviving a sexual relationship with him.We center our sights on this for roughly thirty-five minutes, before flashing back six years earlier, where all the characters are brought into a totally different light. I have never seen a film introduce all the characters in one half of the film, leading us one way, than pulling a so-called ""fast one"" in the second half, swaying us another way. Spoiling the details would be criminal; the motivations, character thoughts, and the reveal on how this obsession with skin actually came to be is truly unforeseeable. But as strange and peculiar it may be, Almodóvar doesn't devote his energy to shocking us, nor does he devote it to being the only thing the film has going for it. He is smart by making the picture continue to run on intelligence, design, and unmistakable suspense after the twist is revealed. If a typical director picked up a pen to write a similar screenplay, likely after the big reveal would be a plodded out series of events lacking a sense of direction. This seems like a film only the person who came up with the idea could make effectively - and as luck would have it, they did.The film is, by an unconventional definition, a horror film. The traditional definition is, ""a film seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears."" I doubt a primal fear for many is what the film has in store, but the true thought of it and the process taken by the characters is what could lead to a startle or a cringe equated to in a traditional horror movie. This is one of the dozen reasons Almodóvar succeeds in his efforts to make the film work; he manipulates the audience in an assertive way, not to generate frustration, but equate it to one of an unsettling nature. The Skin I Live In bares a presence few would knowingly want to experience while watching a movie, and it's that element of surprise that is initiated to make its definition of ""a horror movie"" a completely valid one.Moreover, the culture being shown here is the visceral and universal culture of career-consumption, devotion, ethics, family, and obsession, as well as revenge. For Spanish cinema, this is truly is a strong work, showing that eerie and affecting stories can range from all over the world. Pedro Almodóvar has become one of the most renowned Spanish filmmakers in history for good reason. While picking a very eclectic and freakish subject matter to focus on, he beautifully illustrates the effects that family have on one's mindset, the importance of finding a distinct identity, and carrying out a true passion in a way that makes one feel useful and productive, but could also channel unwanted, suppressed feelings that shouldn't see the light of day. Not only is this a film that can go down as one that depicts culture well, but it offers an intense, fiery psychological debate as well; is Dr. Fedgard acting on his id or superego? Is the behavior he engages normal for him, or has a traumatic event lit a burning fire under his true feelings for life and biomedical research? The Skin I Live In is a film to laud. It's intriguing, multi-layered, haunting, effecting, mesmerizing, beautifully stylistic, and a wholly immersing movie experience. Its low-key presence and looming feeling of a disturbance or an abrupt event occurring, combined with Almodóvar's keen eye for framing and atmosphere make this picture all the more enthralling and unsettling. The fact that it proposes the ideas of complex Spanish culture and psychological relevance, without focusing too much or too little on each subject, gives it even more leverage as an experience as well. It's one of the most unforgettable viewings I've had this year.Starring: Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya. Directed by: Pedro Almodóvar.",positive
"Any review for this film should start with this film is not for the faint hearted but definitely for those who want to see film making at its best. I often find that films coming out of Europe be it in English or subtitled are striving for the best story telling out there with fantastic acting,cinematography and plot and ""The skin i live in"" is no exception. It shoots for the highest heights of cinema and film making with a story both subtle and in your face at the same time leading the audience in one direction before leaving them baffled by Almodivar's use of misdirection.Most of the audience in the showing of the film i was in could not believe what they were seeing and couldn't help but burst out in laughter not because it was meant to be funny but they just could not believe what they were seeing and were left with the only option but to giggle and wonder where the film would take us next. Do not mistake laughing as a bad sign for this film it was more just an expression of disbelief and what a wonderful expression it was even leaving me giggling at the wonderful plot this film has.I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the stomach to deal with it because it is a masterclass of film making and so worth a watch.",negative
"La Piel Que Habito – The Skin I Live In (A) Spanish ""La Piel Que Habito"" is indeed one of the most shocking movies I've seen this year. I have been watching the pictures of the woman in skin color suit with Antonio Banderas but never thought that the truth behind that skin woman will be so shocking and riveting. This revolves around a doctor, whose wife was burned in a brutal car crash and ever since then he is trying to invent a new skin which is hardened and stronger than the regular skin. Now the truth behind the woman he keeps in lock for his experimental skin is more shocking than his illegal practice of animal/human cells. Antonio Banderas has reinvented himself with La Piel Que Habito, it shows how talented this actor is who these days merely plays Buss in Bhoots. Elena Anaya is stunning and did a fantastic job as a woman trapped in a skin suit. Jan Cornet is charming and terrific. Ana Mena as Norma, Antonio's daughter is fine. Marisa Paredes is fantastic. The credit for the brilliance of this movie directly goes to Pedro Almodovar, who didn't hesitated from pushing the boundaries for psychological thriller. Even when we think we have seen everything possible wrong and sick in the movies here comes another shocker which shakes us deep within. A tremendous movie and highly recommended. If you've taste for a great mystery then this one is for you.",positive

"Pedro Almodóvar continues to craft an impressive cinematic career by paying the best type of homage to Alfred Hitchcock—without blatantly copying Hitchcock, Almodóvar appropriates his style, his tone, and his penchant for terrifying subject matter and translates these elements into original, contemporary stories that Hitchcock himself would have surely told if he were alive today and living in Spain.""The Skin I Live In"" focuses on Robert Ledgard (played by Antonio Banderas in what is undoubtedly the most sophisticated performance of his career), a plastic surgeon who has endured more than his share of tragedy—an unfaithful wife who suffers a horribly disfiguring accident, a traumatized daughter unable to cope with her family's misfortune and other indignities, and a childhood and family history of his own that is shrouded in mystery. As he himself slips into madness, Ledgard uses his skill as a surgeon to exact a most horrifying type of revenge on the man who seemingly damaged his daughter beyond repair—and then uses that revenge in a gruesome charade that satisfies his longing for the happiness that has long since left him.In telling this contemporary Gothic tale, Almodóvar tackles a number of grand themes—power, love, delusion, desire—in a way that exploits our preconceptions of gender and identity. ""The Skin I Live In"" is a unique film. If you're already an Almodóvar fan, you'll surely enjoy it. If you're not, it will almost certainly turn you into one.",positive

"A woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) is being held prisoner in a beautiful manor home. She doesn't struggle and is offered proper food and materials through a slot in the wall. Holding her there is a scientist, Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas), and his servant Marilia (Marisa Paredes). Robert is experimenting on skin grafting because he failed to save his wife after a car accident. He is not meant to be experimenting on people and is warned that he will be reported to a scientific board if continues his unorthodox approach. Trouble arises when Robert's brother Zeca (Roberto Alamo) arrives at the house, dressed for Carnaval, and tries to free the woman, thinking she is someone else. This leads to a flashback where we learn the rather tragic story of Robert's wife, his daughter and what led him to imprison the girl locked in the room. Think twice about The Skin I Live In (La Piel Que Habito). That's not a question of whether Pedro Almodóvar's film is amiss or not. It is a masterfully told thriller but one that must considered strictly in terms of doubleness. This is a film concerned by doppelgangers, doubleness and repetition. In one of the opening scenes at a conference, Robert tells us that a face is part of the human identity. This is the basis for many of the film's classical philosophical questions, primarily how one can be in love with an illusion. It is Robert's intention to duplicate his wife through his experiments and research, negating genuine feeling and emotion. It most chilling conveyed through a voyeuristic framing device. Inside Robert's house is a large screen where he can watch the holding cell of Vera. He watches her on the screen, lying naked on her side, yet when he enters the room himself he sees that she has tried to kill herself. In this one sequence, we realise the power of human perception and by contrast, personal desire. I'm also convinced that the film is also embedded in Platonic philosophy, specifically Book VII of The Republic: The Allegory of the Cave, where prisoners are chained up in a cave and can only view the shadows of objects. Plato associates real tangible form with knowledge. Consider that the characters in the film are like prisoners and that the bodies they've lived in are the shadows, what they believe are real forms in the world. Yet outside triggers, like in the case of one sad character a mirror, reveal the truth and the reality about their transformation and a new perspective on tangible form. Cinematically, Almodóvar has always been fascinated by Hitchcock-like dramas, involving murder, scandal and secrets. This film is, I think, his tribute to Vertigo (1958), which was also about a man fascinated by the duplication, perception and illusion of his wife, through an artificial embodiment. At its most personal though, the film is about Almodóvar himself, an openly gay man, acknowledging his own femineity. No matter what our identity is, what face or body shape is, or how people perceive us, there is nothing more unconquerable than the human mind and its ability to think and feel for itself. Real desire cannot be changed, invented or duplicated. Hence, why particular actions are repeated by different characters in the film. Philosophy and intertextuality aside, this is a tremendously efficient thriller, with only a few bumps along the way. There are two scenes in this film involving sexual violence that I found challenging to watch. They're harsh and unflinchingly staged. However, they are not just for cheap shock or sensationalism but eventually revealed as integral points to the narrative. Almodóvar takes his time to tell this story and tests our patience with some of these difficult scenes. Our reward is that we are provided with clarity towards both the plotting and the characters motivations. In terms of design, I liked the realism applied to the scientific elements as well. Most Hollywood thrillers throw a white coat over their scientists and they're ready to cure malaria. The scientific equipment here looks and feels tangible, which brings some credibility to the insane narrative. Meanwhile, Banderas is fairly one-note here but he remains in tune with the film's cold tone. It is refreshing to see him in something that isn't self-parodying and in his narrow corridor of brooding, he is strong enough. Although a tribute to Hitchcock this is as far from a Hollywood thriller as a film can get. It is risky, original and profound, recommended for the patient viewer.",positive
The story is incredibly disturbing and only get worse and worse. You're left with a conclusion so unbelievable and shocking that it leaves you speechless. But what a ride to that point! I could not look away from the screen for a second.,positive
"The movie was visually amazing, the story was for me at least unbelievable. The acting was superb everyone gave 100%. I must say though that Almodovar always pays attention to detail but why did he end it the way he did. I really do think the ending was rushed it really takes the movie from being amazing to something ordinary. The ending should have received the attention the rest of the movie received instead it seems like the ending was something thought up almost like a improvisation to complete the film, extremely trivial ending seen a million times in other films. It was disappointing Almodovar ended it how he did a let down to all the great screen time from all the main actors and actresses, it was a very flat movie for me. Hopefully Almodovar has realized this and will not repeat this in his other future works, a well written ending is very important.",negative
Even his genre films feel like artsy stuff. Pedro Almodovar creates unsettling thriller with many disturbing elements. He goes back to his transgender characters and colorful palette. Antonio Banderas is magnificent.,positive
"Almodóvar presents us with a very original story filled with eccentric characters, lots of sex and the right amount of suspense. The best thing about this film is definitely the script, which slowly unravels the mystery of Vera's character while exploring the rest of the cast in a nonlinear fashion.
Antonio Banderas and Vera Cruz are both great, and the cinematography is also chosen with care. The climax might be where the film is weakest, as the decision Vera takes is too important to be motivated just because of a newspaper. The last scene, however, gives the film its heart and makes me wonder if it would have been a stronger film if it had had Vera as a clear protagonist from the start.",positive
"So, this is a strange film for me, because I was simultaneously impressed and disenfranchised bit. The direction was absolutely spellbinding. There are lots of moments where the way the frame is laid in an absolutely gorgeous way that hints at some deeper meaning; there are a lot of show-don't-tell moments and there are a lot of scenes with great subtlety in them. Almodovar is clearly an experienced director, one who knows what he wants and how to get it. The way the story unfolds is also great- we're constantly learning new things about the characters, things that should've drawn me further and further into the story; only, it didn't. The direction was calculated in such a way that I felt as if every character, every interaction was cold and heartless. A lot of the characters in this movie are also rather thorny people; there aren't really any characters I want to root for. And as we learn the sins that have been committed both against and by these people, we're constantly given different information that makes us reevaluate how to feel about them. From a storytelling standpoint, this is great! It always keeps us guessing, and, as I mentioned above, I was surprised that I just didn't get sucked into this world. I think that my biggest personal problem with my initial viewing is that I didn't know what I was in for. A lot of the themes of the film deal with sexual violence, which, let's face it, isn't a fun topic to begin with. There is a lengthy rape scene near the beginning of the film, another rape scene about halfway through that becomes a focal point of the film, and then there is a lot of dialogue that revolves around this same topic. Let me be clear: this is an important topic that should be discussed, only, I wish I would've known what kind of discussion I was entering before I entered it, if that makes any sense. I have no problem with a film attacking important social issues (""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days""), but I feel like I need a little prior knowledge before jumping headfirst into a two-hour discussion about sexuality and violence's relationship to it. This film is uncomfortable and it doesn't try to hide that at all. There are a lot of moments that made me squirm in my seat, and some of the revelations we learn did just the same thing to me. This movie is, at its heart and soul, a twisted thriller, and it revels in that perversion that it creates.

"In the modern day of cinema it is increasingly more and more difficult to be caught by surprise. A film that very cautiously tells you where it's going and still manages to astonish you at the moment it wants you to be astonished is even rarer. ""The Skin I Live In"" is such a film. However that is not its only feat by far.In this movie the viewer gets confronted by a wide array of philosophic ideas and moral dilemmas. When does one's revenge start to outweigh what it avenges? Can a physical copy of a lost loved one replace that loss? Is the face we see in the mirror an accurate representation of who we are underneath? Or perhaps it is the other way around and we are determined by what we look like? That is only a portion of powerful themes of human condition that are touched in this film.Not only that, but the script in itself is very well written. The plot centers on a mysterious woman by the name of Vera. Little is known about her, but the strange environment she is exposed to and her reaction to it evoke a sense of wonder from the very start. The story will grip the viewer and will not release the interest from its grasp. It progresses very carefully by feeding us only the very essential bits of information until the very climax of the story.Cinematography is also very engaging, everything is done right from the well thought out camera angles to near perfect lighting. The dialogues are well written and acted accordingly. Elena Anaya is stunning in the role of Vera and Antonio Banderas as Roberto is magnificent. In the print of the book this film is based upon, the print I read, on the cover it said that Pedro Almodóvar casted Penelope Cruz in the role of Vera. I'm so glad it is not the case. Imagine a ""bandida"" in that role... That makes my skin crawl quite literally, which is ironic considering the title.The film in question is inspired by a book ""Tarantula"" by Thierry Jonquet. Whilst it wasn't a bad book by any means, it didn't grip me intellectually nor emotionally enough aside from an interesting ending to be called superior. It's still quite a good book, so be sure to give it a shot after you watch this movie. I knew I had to read it cover to cover on the same day I watched ""La piel que habito"". Still the movie is better in almost every way aside perhaps for the ending. The book does not explore morality in the same way and while it deals with redemption quite well the rest of it is often too extreme on the good-and-evil meter. There are mostly no shades of gray which I find to be a lost opportunity that this movie fixes. On the ending: I don't think it would have worked as well in the film. Vera's personality differs from Eva's personality by a whole lot. The film also explores the side characters more, enough for us to want to give them closure.It's not every day that a film makes such an impact on me as to last several days in a row and never leave my memory afterward. A film that both entertains me and makes me think. A film which I have to postpone reviewing, because I have to digest it enough to give my thoughts on it. The only title such film deserves is ""masterpiece"".",positive
"The mad scientist is no stranger to us, and we have one here in the person of Dr. Robert Ledgard, played by Antonio Banderas.He lost his wife after a car fire, and now wants to create a perfect, fireproof woman. His prisoner, Vera (Elena Anaya), lives a life controlled by Ledgard who drugs her, watches her every move on screen, and has his way with her whenever he wants.Legard's half-brother, Zeca (Roberto Álamo) shows up and, after tying up his mother Marila (Marisa Paredes), he rapes Vera. Pedro Almodover usually gives us films that are boldly painted and filled with sexual perversions. This is my 14th Almodover film, and I am not sure I ever recall him dip into horror.The film is excellent in every respect.",positive

"The Skin I Live In (La piel que habito) is an emotionally draining yet highly enjoyable romp into a quasi new genre for Almodóvar. On the outside this has all the markings of a science fiction thriller, but the science involved really isn't the meat and potatoes of the film. It's a drama/romance steeped in mystery and intrigue, masquerading in sci/fi clothing. It stars Antonio Banderas, who reunites with Almodóvar after working with him over 20 years ago. Banderas plays a doctor whose controversial foray into developing new, stronger human skin forces him to test his new substance on a human patient in secret. Her name is Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya), and we are aware that Vera is, or at least was, being held captive inside Banderas' home.There is also the housekeeper, played by one of Almodóvar stand by actresses, Marisa Paredes. She has known Banderas since he was a child. She is well aware of all his secrets, even ones that he isn't aware of. Her main goal is to protect him from the dangers of his work. Vera because of the reconstruction he has done to Vera's skin, he has made her similar to the wife that he lost, a concern for Paredes. Can he separate his feelings from his work, or will he succumb to desire and fall in far deeper than he could possibly imagine?Almodóvar doesn't just give us generic characters in an average plot. No, no, no. He is not the person to put ordinary people in extraordinary situations. He takes extraordinary people and puts them in unimaginable circumstances. He has always done that and will continue to do that, and for that we thank him. Like M. Night Shyamalan, only less predictable, Almodóvar always keeps us on our toes. Just when we think we know where he's going, he jerks us in the other direction, and then jerks us back again. He does so cleanly and efficiently what others would make a mess of.Banderas isn't just a talented doctor, he's a talented doctor bent on righting wrongs, revenging his family, and filling that empty void in his life. The same goes for Vera and Paredes. They both fit archetypical characters from the thriller genre, but there is so much more going on under the surface. Almodóvar's characters are like icebergs. What you see is only a tiny percent of what they are truly made up of.Like so many of Almodóvar's previous films, especially those made in the last decade or so, this film has such a clean look to it. What I mean is the camera shots are well placed, level, and you can easily follow the action. We're not floating around the room or rumbling inside of a car. He and José Luis Alcaine (they've worked together several times before) utilize the beauty of their talent, the beauty of their setting, and juxtapose it with the ugliness of what is going on. There is kidnapping, murder, jealousy, lust, and science experiments, yet somehow they make it all look so chic. The use of color, a prominent feature in many of Almodóvar's films, is highlighted brilliantly here.It's unlike any Almodóvar film I've ever seen, but at the same time it's like wearing your favorite shirt. It just feels so right, so comfortable. The material has changed but the elements are all there. He continues to shine with age and pushes the envelope further and further. He's a rebel, a genius, and a visionary, and one of the most talented artists working today.",positive
"The Skin I Live In is not a typical horror film. Some people might not even consider it horror. Yet, what happens throughout the course of this film is unnerving, sadistic and downright horrific. Without a doubt, the film is a psychological horror film in my books. Just no scares, heck even Almodóvar has described the film as ""a horror story without screams or frights"".Describing the film is also a difficult task. There are numerous plot turns that I simply do not want to divulge. The basic premise of the film has Banderas as a plastic surgeon, who after a difficult past, tries to create a synthetic skin that is impervious to damage. His test subject is an unwilling woman who desperately tries to escape at every opportunity. The film dives into different genres. At times it can be pretty dramatic, then Almodóvar pulls the rug out from under you and you're left watching some twisted things on the screen. He leaves nothing behind and tests the viewers level of how much they can handle. There were times where I was sitting there with my jaw wide open wondering just what the hell was occurring on the screen. Points to Almodóvar for invoking that. The performances here are pretty strong, Banderas plays against his usual type. He's subtle and menacing. Elena Anaya is our woman who is held against her will. She has tortured eyes, which are the focus point of her performance. The film is in Spanish, so maybe the actors felt more comfortable with their native language. The film is twisted, some people will be put off immediately by the content. Rape, death, torture, the film has all of this. In another filmmakers hands, maybe this content would ruin the picture and have it fall into the realm of low grade horror trash, but with Almodóvar, he somehow elevates the material. It's mature enough to avoid falling into line with those other films. Can I recommend the film? Sure, but with a warning. It's twisted.",positive
"It's very difficult to review this movie without spoiling the story/surprises for the first time viewer. But I made a conscious effort to leave all the surprises untouched. The good points: - Beautiful photography - Very intriguing especially at the beginning - Will stay with you for some time - Panderas left his ""boyish"" way of acting aside and is showing a more mature Panderas. However, don't expect much from the guy. At his best, he still doesn't have much to offer. The bad points: - The story is very stupid, and it gets ""stupider"" as they keep going. - The choice of actors is wrong. Especially as the story develops, it does seem that choosing the main female character in this movie in an insult to the intelligence of viewers. They should have chosen another woman of more ... um.... different physique that might make the story hold a bit more water. - The tension built up to deliver virtually nothing in the end. - The make up working on the deformed wife.. Really? They made the actress describing her ""non-human horrific injuries"" sound and look like an idiot. - There were several points in the scenario that were just ridiculous! You need to be really stoned not to notice. - The acting was a bit theatrical in many cases. -The ""child"" in the movie was a farce. - What's with all the staring?!!!!!!!!! - Last but not least, they should have watched more Jerry Springer to get more material on the major horror in the movie. Straight men don't swing both ways. Regardless. And wearing your hair in two buns doesn't make you a child no matter how hard you stare. Now finally, a question... Do you know any guy who runs like a ballerina, floating and stretching his feet to make his legs looks more slender on camera?",negative
"So, this is a movie that I would assume sends a visceral chill down the spines of most men. It was an intelligent film that finds it's horror at deep psychological levels. Antonito Banderas did a wonder job portraying the brilliantly dark doctor and his female counterpart matched his abilities. This only helped in creating the tense nature between the two. This is definitely creepy and sure to leave you saying WTF afterwards but I'm not sure that it would be to everyone's liking. Take a chance on it. If you are one of the folks who would like it then you are in for a treat.",positive
"The Skin I Live In is one of the oddest films I've ever seen. This is definitely suited more towards those who love Art House Cinema and could care less for big explosions and car chases. This is not a fun movie to watch, however it is very intriguing and has one of the more original stories I've seen in a movie. The cast is splendid and nobody overshadows anyone. The script isn't anything special but the director and cinematographer get top marks for this gorgeous looking film. It will disturb you, it'll make you wince and it'll most likely get under your skin as the music doesn't help much with calming your nerves. If you've got guts and want to be shocked by an incredible piece of art, then see it. I'll probably never watch this again but it is worth seeing once.",negative
"So far, I'm an Almodóvar sceptic, having found the much acclaimed All About My Mother an embarrassing watch. Yet,this film is a fantastic piece of cinema. Therefore, the two films of his I have seen sit on opposite ends of the spectrum. It tells the story of a 'semi-retired', incredibly successful plastic surgeon (played with a very subtle hint of madness throughout by the always watchable Antonio Banderas) and his research into cultivating perfect skin (ie. cannot burn and is ignored by mosquitoes). His test subject is a young girl, whose past we know nothing of, or at least for the first hour or so. They have a very strange relationship, and the film is a wonderful mystery from the start. I won't say anything else on the plot, which unravels with such ease, every twist, turn and shock bound to entrance you. It's flamboyant, disturbing and highly imaginative, as are many Almodovar films, I gather. While it does have many of the same deficiencies as All About My Mother (poor dramatic timing, weak script) they are not obvious or bad enough to detract your attention away from what is both an emotional and thought-provoking journey through the minds of a psychopath and the people who surround him.",positive
"I must confess this is the only Pedro Almodovar film I've seen so far; not because I don't like subtitled films (I have enjoyed many), just because the subject matter rarely interests me much. This, I thought, sounded intriguing.
Not sure I'll watch another. What I want to know is: what is Pedro Almodovar taking? If he's not on meds, he probably should be. He's one sick puppy.
This lurid body horror story revolves around a maverick plastic surgeon who runs his private clinic from his substantial countryside home. He is at odds with his colleagues over his suspicious ethics, but he somehow manages to keep a secret patient (against her will). It soon becomes apparent that her mental state is probably on the deranged side, and yet there is no suggestion that this doctor's expertise is in psychiatry. So who is she and how is it that she can be kept there without professional oversight? Why does the housekeeper help him to do this? Also, why does the patient have nothing to wear except a 'nude' body stocking?
The 'skin' of the title is the good doctor's crowning scientific achievement, which he claims to have developed using some kind of mouse model; he claims it is a revolution in skin grafting, which it appears he has mastered by experimenting on his patient, but it is never apparent why she might have needed total skin replacement. For me this was the second weakest element of the story, and I would consider it a massive red herring. It is not explained forensically enough to be satisfying in a sci-fi sense, but at the same time it detracts and distracts from the essential mood of the film.
The weakest aspect, which requires a huge suspension of disbelief not to yank you out of the prevailing atmosphere the film creates, is just too hard to swallow. To go into detail would be to whip the rug out from under the whole thing, to reveal the twist and spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but thinks they might want to. If it wasn't so unbelievable, it would have been jaw-dropping for all the right reasons. But I just couldn't buy it; my scientific mind couldn't accept it for the wondrous horror it was meant to be. Some of the characters' motivations for the things they did or the opinions they held didn't ring true for me either.
Having said that (and possibly unintentionally intrigued a few people into looking it up), the principal actors did a very solid job. Elena Anaya looks AMAZING for a woman of 36, and she was interestingly beguiling and inscrutable. The flashback structure of the film, while being essential to tell the story in the right way, is a little confusing and distracting at times.
So overall, I can understand why some people get lost in the ambitious and dark craziness of this film, but I couldn't see past its shortcomings to care all that much.",negative

Still, what an elegant proof it is.A meditation on profound themes such as memory, grief, violence, degradation, and survival !(Pedro Almodóvar worked on the screenplay for almost a decade, and what initially was an adaptation ended up being more of a story inspired by Thierry Jonquet's novel.)It's far away from usual Obsessions of #pedroalmodovar like betrayal, anxiety, loneliness, sexual identity, He mixed up with a science-fiction element that verges on horror.it all looks ravishing and production designer Antxon Gómez and cinematographer José Luis Alcaine.

La piel que habito es una película que te atrapa desde el minuto uno.

"While convoluted and, sometimes,tedious, ""The Skin I live in"" evokes the theme of obsession in a manner worthy of such classic films as ""Eyes Without a Face"" (1960), ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""The Night Porter"" (1974) and ""Obsession"" (1976), while managing to be even more perverse and disturbing than any of these.""Vera"" (Elena Anaya) whiles away her days in either provocative yoga positions, totally nude, applying sackcloth to sculpture, or receiving experimental skin grafts from her captor, Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas. When not totally nude, Vera is clothed in a body suit, which is skin tight right down to shaping her private parts. In addition to Robert applying illegal, genetically modified skin grafts, he gives Vera opium pipes to remove her memory. What connection does this have to the deaths of Robert's wife and daughter? Who is Vera? The answers will both fascinate and horrify you.As ""Vera,"" Spain's leading actress, Elena Anaya, gives the most sensuous performance since Meryl Streep in ""Sophie's Choice"". Her awards and nominations are well deserved. Sadly, for ""The Skin I Live In,"" Elena was overlooked for a Golden Globes or an Oscar. Oh well, maybe her performance in ""The Skin I Live in"" is just too kinky for these ""mainstream"" organizations. Banderas is also excellent, the perfect mix of victimized husband and monster.As for Pedro Almodovar, with ""The Skin I Live in,"" he is either spectacularly good or almost inept, depending upon the sequence in the film. Perhaps, I am not sophisticated enough to appreciate Almodovar's ""genius"". However, I felt Almodovar misses the mark too many times to either give him or ""The Skin I Live In"" the praise I would otherwise grant it. Nonetheless, I give a movie that could have been a ""10"" a solid ""7""...and as a writer/producer, I hope someday to have the honor of working with the almost irresistible Elena Anaya.",positive
"My thoughts after watching this movie: What the hell did I just see? The Skin I live In is a rare movie. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.First of all, the story is told in a non linear way and it doesn't really start to make sense to the viewer until the second act of the movie begins. To someone who has never seen this film, the first act may seem weird, out of context and just illogical. The movie does depend entirely on the second act, yes, but it's beautifully put together so the viewer can understand the story. A very dark and disturbing one that is. I am pleased to say this movie is very well directed, very well acted (especially Banderas and Anaya) and it's just a great piece of art cinema. The movie constantly makes us wonder what we actually feel about watching what is unfolding on screen and in the end, you'll love the way director Pedro Almodovar successfully manipulated your thoughts and feelings.The one actually very big flaw I found with the movie is that I really think Zeca's character, although it tries to bring in some humor into the story, wasn't really necessary to have, if you really think about it. If his character didn't exist in the movie, it would have unfolded the same way.Overall, The Skin I Live In is an excellent movie. Very disturbing and oddly structured, feels a lot like a Spanish Hitchcock movie because of all the suspense.",positive
"This movie is a try-hard with cheap soap-opera tactics to engage the viewer Going by other reviews here, I must be a genius because I saw the twist/reveal pretty much right at the start of when Vincente first appeared on screen.The director tries to camouflage degeneracy as 'art', but decent, intelligent people will see through it!",negative
"When I sat down to watch The Skin I Live In, I didn't know what to expect. It's a Spanish film, it's written and directed by someone called Pedro Almodóvar, who in my 20 years I had yet to come across, and the poster gives little away other than suggesting Antonio Banderas is in it and a lot of critics think it's very, very good. Call it my age or a lack of film knowledge, but I had no idea what I was in for and I'm glad this was the case.The Skin I Live In is a thriller that is all the more impressive because of its genuine ability to shock. Almodóvar's film is stylish and well wrought, yet deeply unsettling in the stealth and nuance of its plot. The prominence of the 'Torture Porn' style in the thriller and horror genre, with filmmakers having to go to more graphic and extreme lengths to coax a gasp out of the movie-going audience, suggests that we are increasingly difficult to disturb. But with a lighter touch, this film takes conventional, twisted themes and makes them unusual and shocking once more. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and this is the essence of its success.Dr Robert Ledgard (Banderas) is a pioneering plastic surgeon and researcher, who has created a type of skin which has the potential to 'better' mankind. In his home and laboratory, located in the hills of Toledo, he hides a terrible secret, a woman called Vera (Elena Anaya) who has been the subject of his ungodly experiments.Instantly, we seem to be in familiar Frankenstein territory. As a result, the film naturally raises questions about eugenics, perfection and science's battle with nature and mortality. Yet this is much more than a modern retelling of Shelley's classic tale. Following an attempted break-in by an old enemy of Ledgard's, Vera begins to ask questions about the doctor's past. The remainder of the film proceeds to fill in the gaps of the past six years, exploring how Vera came to be imprisoned and why Ledgard is the way he is. What proceeds from thereon is a dark, complex and utterly bizarre melodrama.Like a cheesy American soap opera, the plot moves in a knowingly ridiculous fashion. The film is a mixed bag of betrayal, family secrets and plastic surgery, yet its self-awareness and style save it from being too cartoonish. The sober acting of both Banderas and Anaya, creates a restrained tone which allows the film to remain somewhat real and affecting. However, its greatest asset is nonetheless its otherworldly feel.The central twist is in many ways a cheap shock, but it maintains its impact due to Almodóvar's masterful direction. The clinical style which he employs is the perfect match for the cold, calculated nature of its main character, yet it is also highly stylised and this makes the conventional twists of the storyline all the more unsettling and eerie. The film is shrouded in a dark strangeness, which puts the viewer very much on-edge, making the all-important twist both staggering and effective.The sense of being 'on the edge of one's seat' is a tired cinema cliché. When it comes to The Skin I Live In, however, this phrase is highly appropriate. While the film unashamedly relies on shock value, this is achieved in a masterful and creative fashion. Clearly aware of how difficult it is to surprise the modern audience, Almodóvar proceeds to play with our expectations and transplants us into a strange space in which we have no way of knowing what will happen next. The Skin I Live In is a testament to Almodóvar's ability to breathe new life into a tired formula and a reassurance that cinema can still surprise us.",positive
This movie undoubtedly remains my fav thriller movie. If I speak much I will end up with spoilers. Amazing storyline. Gracefully handled. Superb acting :),positive
"The Skin I Live In is definitely the sort of film that you don't want to go into knowing a lot about. In the same way that all you need to know about The Cabin in the Woods is that 5 friends get attacked whilst staying in a cabin and with The Ordeal a singer's car breaks down in the woods, all you need to know about The Skin I Live In is that a doctor is working on synthetic skin. Of course like with all the other synopis' the outcome is a lot more complex and shocking than that. I went in (well put the disc in) not knowing much about it either, just knowing that it was a sort of revenge story, I had no real clue what the film was about and I'm glad I didn't because it completely took me by surprise.The Skin I Live In may leave you bemused with its confusing opening which poses a lot of questions such as 'who's that woman?' and 'why is she there?' but rest assured because everything will be explained in one of the most gripping and visceral ways I've seen. What makes the Skin I Live In so great is its unpredictable screenplay which changes directions numerous times, leaving you dazzled as to who the characters actually are and how your feelings towards them change as the film progresses. Once the twist starts revealing itself I was in complete shock at its originality and innovation. The film perfectly draws you in to its characters and their stories and then hits you like a ton of bricks. I was left saying 'who the hell thought this up?' and the answer is someone utterly brilliant!The narrative unfolds through various flashbacks and flashforwards, but once you piece it all together it's surprisingly simple. I was gripped throughout its long-ish running time and was actually left wanting more out of its ending! The Skin I Live In creates fantastically complicated characters leading interesting lives, hopefully unlike yours and mine. I can honestly say that I've never seen anything quite like it and I've seen Conspirators of Pleasure for Christ's sake! However, whilst Conspirators of Pleasure aims to bemuse its audience through surrealist imagery, the Skin I live In uses intelligence and originality whilst not alienating its audience.The film also looked fantastic with rarely a frame being out of place. I've never seen a Pedro film before, but this has got me interested in the man. There's incredible cinematography and the whole look of the film is very stylish with its use of colour and set-design. The acting is also top-class too with Antonio on fine form, and the other actors (whom I've never heard of, but must be great in Spain) were equally as engaging. I also enjoyed ts use of location which all created the right impact whether it be a lavish party, a minimalist bedroom or cave-like basement. There's plenty of mise-en-scene at use which media students could have a ball at analysing.I don't really want to get too much into the film because I don't want to spoil it. It's a film you need to experience for yourself, but don't worry it's worth a buy because you're probably going to want to give it a few more looks again. The Skin I Live In is film-making at its best with wonderful acting and directing as well as a careful and utterly engaging screenplay. The film's originality, uniqueness and innovation has to be applauded and makes the film a near-perfect masterpiece that I hope to watch again in a very different light. Give it a go!",positive
"Almodóvar is a true artist. I think anyone who has seen this film has, to a lesser or greater degree, been perturbed. And that is exactly what he wanted. As a born provocateur, Almodóvar subverts the viewer's logic with an intriguing plot and strong characters.After all, there are many layers of discussion here: identity, sexuality, aggressiveness, animality and even sanity. It is conflicts that move the film. Of course, conservative audiences are not going to get the message positively ... but that's another story and it doesn't matter.Honorable mention to the actors Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya, who give life to the art of disturbing that comes out of Almodóvar's head. One of the director's great films.",positive
"It's very difficult to sum up The Skin I Live In without giving away the twists and turns of its mind-blowing plot. My advice is to go in without any knowledge of the story and prepare to be shocked, disturbed, appalled, spellbound and gob-smacked. If you thought Talk to Her was disturbing, wait until you see this. Pedro Almodovar has created another layered, meticulously crafted film full of complex themes, interesting characters and shocks. The film is beautifully directed, with many frames representing a beautifully composed painting. This movie represents an auteur at the height of his powers. This movie hasn't got much violence. It hasn't got a lot of screaming. It has no scares. It has no suspense set-pieces or jumpy moments. It isn't even particularly atmospheric in the horror movie sense. But it will leave you traumatized. This is, if considered a horror film despite this (Which I do since it makes 90% of other horror movies look like Thomas the Tank Engine and I am not joking), a truly horrifying experience you will never forget. While a very clever movie, it's not exactly enjoyable to watch and at times feels muddled and confused in the way it conveys its messages. Also, some of the time the characters feel a bit underdeveloped and it's not quite as cleverly constructed as Talk to Her. Still, this is a very impressive work, although it will be too much for some to stomach.8/10",positive

"Wow. I'd only heard this movie mentioned on occasion but when it is mentioned people regard it VERY, VERY highly. Now I know why. It's my first impression of Spanish filmmaker Pedro Aldomovar and it made a very impactful one. I definitely feel inspired to explore more of his acclaimed filmography after this.First of all, this movie starts with such out-there themes, characters, and scenarios, that you don't even think about the typical strengths that define most thrillers, then you get a little further into the movie and it all hits you at once like a bag of bricks - HOLY MOLY, this movie just did what so many movies try to do, but 10x better than they do it. It's pure chaos coated in sugar (or in this case, covered in artificial skin), puppeteered masterfully.If there's one word to summarize this movie, it's probably PROVOCATIVE. It's extremely provocative, because it encapsulates BOTH definitions of that word. It's at times very seductive and alluring, but once the truth begins unraveling itself, you realize you've been duped. It's anything but. Underneath that soft sensual FLESH, is everything but... deceit, addiction, possession, abuse of power, pain, etc... PURE CEREBRAL HORROR!Though it often feels somewhat far-fetched, it never goes far enough so as not to remain entirely emotive & terrifying in a relative manner. The bizarro elements simply give it just the right amount of surrealism instead - the cherry on top of this singular masterpiece. This is definitely my favorite Antonio Banderas movie now, by a long shot, actually. It's also my introduction to Elena Anaya, who is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful in this film, and puts in a powerhouse performance. Force of nature.To my knowledge, this movie is a vision entirely of its own. I've never seen anything quite like it. It is most certainly twisted, but not without purpose. There is a lot to take in with this movie - it's all heavy but it's all delicately woven with what feels like great viscera. I highly, highly recommend this movie.(WARNING: This movie does deal with RAPE. If you are sensitive to the subject of rape covered in films, you may want to avoid)",positive
"Whew boy,....where do I begin? I will not give away any surprises here because I want everyone to enjoy this as much as I did. It's a brilliant, original story with a surprise that I very briefly thought about, a flash really, but didn't think would actually be part of this story. The acting here is excellent by everyone. The sets, production, story, script are excellent. I really enjoyed the pace of the story as well. Some of Pedro's films have flashbacks and sometimes that works for me and sometimes it doesn't. The flashback worked very well here. Probably Pedro's bloodiest film. A new direction for him. There was one small element that I didn't care for and I see that on the boards but for the most part, this is really a stunning film. I think most people will find it very interesting.",positive
"I consider myself for realy open minded person when there is question about art and movies, but this movie is really disgusting from begining to the end. I can not imagine what whas the point of making this kind of movie. Beside that, all actors here are totaly wasted.What was the point of Zeka? So disgusting role that had absolutely no point in the movie. Cleaning lady/mother also didnt have point to be in the movie. What was her role anyway? Its so shallow movie that in the end of the movie as viewer you are not conected to anyone and everyone in movie are making you sick, so it becomes so not important for you how this movie is gonna end, who is gonna survive and who is gonna stay alive, because you dont actualy care for any of them. Maybe that everyone died in the end, it would be the best ending, but when I think about it it would be best that I didnt even watched this sick movie. Only emotion you are gonna have after this movie is sicknes and regrets that you wasted 2 hours of your life...",negative
"Almodovar has been consistently brilliant for nearly two and a half decades. his only movie to disappoint me so far has been Volver(return). Here, he weaves such a tight plot around an eccentric and brilliant plastic surgeon who is creating a new type of synthetic skin. The story, written by Almodovar himself, is refreshing and the events unpredictable. there are some scenes which are unique in their power, like the sequence wherein the camera focuses on a vacuum cleaner sucking up pieces of shredded cloth. The acting is pretty good. The director who is known widely for his dramatic movies, treads new ground in this thriller and masters it in the very first go. 4 out of 5 for this. Movies like this and others in his filmography are the reason why he is in my not to be missed at any cost list.",positive
"A woman in a skin-colored body suit, rags glued on busts like skin, a surgeon creating artificial skin, a naked woman on a large TV screen, later discovered to have cut her skin in an apparent suicide attempt: Pedro Almodóvar's new film opens with a parade of skins – real and artificial, apparent and torn, patched together and stifling. The surface we see when we see another person – or ourselves. A surface we often confuse with identity and one in which we might be trapped. As are the characters in The Skin I Live In: Covered in a tight second skin, suffocating in their clothes or held in captivity – in a shed, an empty room, a hospital. Identity is Almodóvar's persistent subject – and never has it been more dominating than in this film. When you change the surface, does the core it covers change, too? Undoubtedly a fascinating question but perhaps one too hard to answer in a mere 117 minutes. Almodóvar, this magical explorer of human identity wants to uncover it all – but this time the master story-teller fails in what he does best: story-telling.The tale he spins is highly complex, outrageously absurd, full of twists, turns and many surprises. This is hardly new for Almodóvar – what is new is that he forgets to create characters in the process, that he gets so enamoured by his plot ideas that he often gets carried away with the originality of yet another strange turn and loses sight of the big picture. His films often have a fragmented nature but in the end the pieces come together in a strange and colorful mosaic. Not this time: the perfectly lighted, often a touch artificial but always glamorously beautiful imagery, the highly polished look – they conceal nothing. Once the surface is peeled away, all remains empty. In this film, the surface is its identity because there is nothing underneath.At times, The Skin I Live In seems like a long and tenuous sexual fantasy, vulgar, brutal and unbearably kitschy. Yet the irony which usually defuses such all too common elements in Almodóvar's work remains absent. The dialogues are painfully simple and obvious, the plot lines way too grotesque and over the top, the twists and turns too absurd to keep the viewer captivated. Again, this is not new but in previous films all this tended to serve a purpose. Here it usually just stands for itself.Science fiction, thriller, horror movie, family drama: As often, Almodóvar mixes the genres, throws them at each other, entangles them in the strangest combination. Here they remain patchwork, pieces the viewer marvels at or shies away from, but they do not open eyes. Antonio Banderas is a non-entity, a soulless puppet, and so is everybody else. The acting is determinedly bland, yet this denial of emotion opens no doors, it shuts the last of them.So what was might have been a study in human identity, how we twist and violate it, how the human hubris wants to create identity at its will, dissolves into a parade of effects, a kind of visual shock and awe that does not touch, that does not force one into thinking, that just bounces off. Pedro Almodóvar has not created another masterpiece – if anything, The Skin I Live In in the film equivalent of teflon.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",negative
"Back in the seventies there was TV series, and for the life of me I can't remember the name, but it always started out with a picture of a carousel and associated music. the stories were always or usually by Roald Dahl. They were usually creepy or weird but done in a way that quickly and effectively got the story across.This movie felt like it had two or three of those stories stitched together. The photography was beautiful, the music exceptional and Elena is gorgeous (if somewhat mousy).The problem for me is that the movie itself added noting new. The story telling just didn't flow or jolt. After the first twenty minutes I felt detached and started checking how much longer it had to go (I watched a bluray recording).I can't claim to know the director or his work, although from other reviews it appears that he is 'famous'. I have some seen some very mediocre films by Hitchcock, and as a story telling this movie would fit that category.",negative
"I am not a great fan of Almodovar, especially so of his first period of films. But this film knocked me out!. It took him a long time to arrive at this stage (coming from ""Broken Embrace"" and ""Volver""), and rendering a great but unlike mix of sci-fi, melodrama, thriller and horror movie. His icon star Antonio Banderas is impeccable and with a very strong performance in this film. The script (loosely based on Thierry Jonquet's short novel ""Mygale"" (entitled ""Tarántula"" in Spanish), is brilliant, since it includes an also brilliant twist that is not in the novel. The music, though stereotyped, is very well written and played and is eventually very effective. Actress Elena Anaya is superb, and delivers a great emotional performance as required, including a lot of her body exposure. The overall cinematography is excellent and the use of on-screen notes on dates (due to several flashbacks and forward, as well as some characters in the film resembles 50s horror/amazing stories movies. This is a shocking film but, hopefully, to be enjoyed and remembered.",positive
"Based on the trashy pulp novel Tarantula, this Almodóvar production has a bit more depth and feels better on the big screen than as a junk novel by Thierry Jonquet. This is truly a bizarre tale of a surgeon who gets revenge on a man who assaulted his daughter, by surgically turning him into a beautiful woman and then begins to fall in love with her. This freakshow of a film is both a grotesque comedy and a unique relationship tale and Antonio Banderas gives his best performance in a long, long time. The Skin I Live In pushes bad taste into an A picture that actual resonates on an emotional level. It's basically a mad scientist and a captured woman in distress tale gone to lurid extremes, but with a director who steers this clear of camp and actually makes a film of substance.",positive
I can't tell that I liked Almodovar movies but this one really deserved my attention. This is not a typical Almodovar movie 'cause it's a thriller and you are expecting good twist to come. And really the twist is so good and outstanding but I think not unrealistic. The way how director described us a story is very interesting and unique 'cause I haven't seen something similar before. I'm writing this review in general because I don't want to spoil you a plot. Don't read any of those reviews with spoilers and your impression after watching this movie will be stronger. If Hitchcock was still alive he would make a similar movie. Hitchcock influence was crucial on Almodovar to direct this film and it is not a reason to skip it. The end is a little bit faint and defective and could've been better but the movie is very good in general and don't miss it.,positive
"I have loved Almodovar's films since the 1980s and have seen every one of them. I can say without reservation that this is my least favorite. As usual, he has sleek and beautiful interiors and fantastic performances. Antonio Banderas was creepily intense and intensely creepy. The performances of the younger leads, Elena Anaya and Jan Cornet were affecting, for sure. Always like the fact that his characters sway to the left of normality and the plots twist when one thinks it's going to turn. However, unlike Almodovar's other films, this one lacks any humor, any compassion for its characters. It's just plain dark in a suffocating way. Volver was his last film that affirmed life in any way. I would recommend skipping this film.",negative
"There's a scene in 1943's Old Acquaintance in which Bette Davis flies into a melodramatic rage (surprise surprise). This rage, however, is different from all the other Oscar-baiting ones. She doesn't act like Alexis Carrington or some other miserable cat who has a way with venomous words; she instead uses every ounce of her conserved up hatred to grab the villain of the film (Miriam Hopkins) by the shoulders and shake her like she's a ketchup bottle with just a few droplets left to spare. Hardly subtle; lip-smackingly entertaining. We absorb it.In an Almodóvar film, a moment like this is almost a given, in the most ironic subversion, that is. He enjoys Sirk, Hitchcock, and their cohorts, dramatizing their Technicolor guises and steroiding their hammy, soap operatic story lines. His movies sometimes go down dark paths, but they frequently drive 120 miles-per-hour through sickeningly funny ones too. No matter the brassy façade, though, they are always deliriously enjoyable, slightly bonkers but whip-smart, completely deliberate in their actions and definitely aware of how they're coming across. His best (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, All About My Mother) are masterpieces of gaudy style and sexual energy; his worst still contain gaudy style and sexual energy, but the results aren't quite so good at being, I don't know, enjoyable.The Skin I Live In is not his best nor his worst; undoubtedly, it is his most grotesque. Whereas his past projects have included differing shades of erotic obsession and a wandering eye for the human body, The Skin I Live In combines the two with turbulent malignancy. Camp is to be found, and so is dark humor, but new to Almodóvar is the sheer repulsiveness that regularly comes to visit, unwanted most of the time. It also has a story that pushes the boundaries of the absurd (and for Almodóvar that's saying something), and it doesn't work as well here as it has in the past. However many issues the film has, though, it is still an aberrant thriller of merciless style; it works, warts, sex changes, face transplants and all.At the center of The Skin I Live In is Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas), a brooding scientist obsessed with creating indestructible skin in the wake of his wife's fiery death. In an Eyes Without a Face twist, he is not testing on various young women but rather one, a beauty whom he calls Vera (Elena Anaya). Vera is kept locked in a wide-open room, wearing a flesh-colored body suit at all times, given food through a dumbwaiter. She is a guinea pig, albeit a well-treated one, to Robert's tests.Also dwelling in this house of horrors is Marilia (Marisa Parades), his faithful servant who may have a few secrets of her own. But right when we begin to think that we have a grip on the relationship between these people, Almodóvar backhands some sense into us. Before we know it, things start to get complicated, more complicated than we ever could have imagined.I wish I could complain to you about how ridiculous this movie gets — it truly gets ridiculous — but The Skin I Live In is much too visceral of an experience to spoil. The twists are not regular twists, rather drive- offs of 1,000 feet cliffs that land in the Mediterranean Sea. You have to see, hear, and feel them for yourself. Dramatic, yes, but cliffdroppers like this only exist in the season premieres of something like Dallas or the pop of a Korean soap. The music is static and technological (a surprise for an Almodóvar film), and the actors somehow manage to handle their director's just go with it attitude (in return, Banderas gives an underrated performance).A film as well assembled as The Skin I Live In does not get an average rating in the normal sense; it gets an average rating by comparison to Almodóvar's other movies. It might not be as lovable as Volver, let's say, but there is still plenty to appreciate. The work of an auteur always has something to behold, even if it's Topaz or Passion. Fans will be pleased to find Almodóvar trading his usual reds and oranges for a more blued palette; newcomers will be stunned by the jarring cinematography and the overripe plot. It's certainly grotesque — but at least it's masterfully so.",negative
"The Skin I Live In is a mix of horror, thriller and drama. The ride thru these genres is done masterfully. The movie starts strangely. Audience is presented to the main characters without any solid concerns to their connections. With that in mind, Almodóvar hides from the audience all the plot keys till the moment the audience can't hold it anymore, and then you're surprised when you discover the hole thing. Gets a great time till that happen. For several times I thought the movie was boring and I was almost giving up watching. But that is Almodóvar, he likes to create an entire atmosphere before take the best cards of his sleeves.I really don't think if this is one of his best movies, but surely one of his most bizarre and well directed, for the fact that, as he stated, the main idea was an horror movie, but without scares and screams. To create a horror movie without those elements the director needs to know how to deal with bizarre themes and our native fears. Almodóvar does that, but his concept of bizarre still being graceful and subtle instead of being gross and gory, and our native fears are moved by the fantasy he forces the audience to create thru things he haven't revealed yet. I think that, comparing to his last movies that drank a lot from thriller genres - and as I said before - he guides you masterfully thru it in this one, developing the plot entirely with no red herrings, only showing the necessary in the right dosed moments.For sure this is a psychotic, obsessive, perverse and ambitious movie, everything well explained by the Pygmalion Effect, explored extensively throughout the movie, which is amazing. As another one said: ""this sits beautifully on the line between Cronenberg at his best and a crazy soap opera"".",positive
"Nothing much to say about this movie the reviewers already reviewing nicely about which is the truth. One of a top movie not only I regard it with a good twist of plot but also the acting of the actors are really superb. The magical acting to all of the actors especially Banderas really making me enjoying this movie more and addicted to it, Banderas showing his charismatic appeal yet cruel and weak appearance at the same time while the main actress whom I never heard of before since I never watched any Spanish movie Elena Anaya is an intelligent actress whom showing perfect struggling emotion of what had become her, the other actors are acting nice too. The great brave sex scenes doesn't feel like morally wrong even though it's not suppose to be (I am talking about Banderas and Anaya almost-sex scenes not the rapist Zeca one) and both of them showing physically different passion of what suppose to be the rule of making love which can be comprehended very well by the audiences.Twist plot with good sequences, I seldom found a director that can bring this much sense into a movie but this director Pedro Almodóvar amazes me with his brilliant work. Keep doing this and I'll become his biggest fan. Still cannot give 10 out of 10 since I am a lover of happy-ending movies so this is the best 9 that I can give to value this movie.Appreciate this brilliant movie a lot.",positive
"Honestly, I dont understand how this movie is only a 7.6. The concept, the plot, the execution, the portrayal of the key players in this film is marvelous. The unfolding of the story and the unfolding of the truth are two very different things in this movie. If you are hesitant to watch the movie because of Antonio Banderas, rest assured, this is unlike any of his films you have ever seen before. The portrayal he has given in this movie is a far cry from any of his mainstream films.Pedro Almodovar has created twisted, shocking, manic, polished film from start to finish. When you think the story couldnt possibly shock you anymore, it takes another turn. Highly recommended.",positive
Love movies with a twist! it keeps you captivated and asking yourself whst happens next!,positive
"The Skin I Live in is a very disturbing movie about plastic surgery, and if you are easily disturbed I suggest you know what you're in for. This Spanish horror movie stars Antonio Banderas as an obsessed plastic surgeon called Robert Ledgard that looks for the way to make the perfect skin and who gives a subtly eerie performance that visualizes the insanity of obsession, breaking thick boundaries to get there. Unexpectedly, the film then entirely develops into a horrific nightmare that gets more frightening as it goes along, with Robert Ledgard going to extreme lengths to create the skin as perfect as possible. There have been a lot of shocking scenes in this film that have stuck in my memory for a few days now and have troubled my mind hauntingly, and that effect on a two hour event gets my dearest respect for the courage it has to not play it safe and keep away from disturbing it's audience. The soundtrack, editing and cinematography then top it all off, creating an extremely disturbing horror movie that is repulsing and at the same time frighteningly fascinating.",positive
"When we all expected Antonio Banderas'career to have reached a dead end, here comes Mr Pedro Almodovar and offers him a great role in his newest movie: La Piel que Habito.My advice to those who will watch this movie: do not read spoilers, just go with the basic info you need: Banderas is a surgeon working on some sort of synthetic skin while keeps a strange relationship with one of his patients who lives in his house. Then just let the movie take you to Almodovar's brains while keeping your mind open, which is a requirement to 99% of his movies.Elena Anaya portrays the ""muse"" beautifully, and Marisa Paredes delivers a believable role as always. But the best is really how Almodovar slowly reveals each piece of the puzzle until a crucial twist.To those who complain about this being a horror movie, I would say it is a fiction with some suspense, but no gore. Yes, there are scenes you don't see in your romantic comedy movies, but this is just Almodovar's style: colorful, intention to shock, unusual plots, but careful direction and a lot of focus on the actors'performance. And that brings me back to my first comment: Banderas is creepy as the troubled surgeon, and fights all the time between science, human feelings and his own madness. While this performance is not going to give him awards, it is 500% better than his last ones.Without giving much away, I should say that this is a movie you have to see it by yourself. As in most of movies of directors like Almodvar, Tarantino, etc, this tends to bring love or hate kind of reactions. But even the haters should give the credit to this man who defies the ""same old same old"" industry and brings us something to talk about!",positive
"The 1st half goes back and forth, explains the events to the present.

2nd half is more linear and the story develops in a way you feel sorry for both main characters, but they also deserve to be punished.Very interesting plot.",positive
"I do have all my respect to the Spanish Cinema,its truly an art cinema that produces yearly well made films,not necessarily high in budget yet it contains many elements that can make it an art film this film combines many of them, the acting of Antonio B. came very mature and versatile, Elena acted very well to extend she made me curious to pursue her other films she made, and today i just watched her other one year older-room in Rome- the story line and the plot is new and the climax is built up for this film is a clever way ,( to create and bring back the memory an old lover from an enemy is something that is worth thinking of after you watch the film) to fall in love with the person you most hate , having said that,Of course there are some goofs and the ending last minute is a bit expected but overall i enjoyed this film..if you have a chance to go see it please do i think its worth it.",positive
"First of all the movie is awfully paced,boring scenes draw out too long,then they rush the most important scenes without an explanation leaving massive plot holes and the movie just ends..
Movies description is nothing what you really get,there's no horror genre in this either,might aswell remove it.Makes you think why such people are even allowed to make movies like this and how many psycho's think like that own the movie businesses.The psychopathic obsession over gender and sex. I watched a lot of movies that touch such evil subjects but they have a moral lesson in it somewhere. This movie doesn't teach you anything,leaves a gross feeling in your stomach,realizing movies like these are based on real events that can only be talked about through movies,it is well known what showbiz does to your sexuality. I feel like Pedro is telling us something he can't tell on live tv. That this is common in the west especially among kids. Just look at famous actors and their trans kids who 'decided' at age 4 who they are,when we grown ups don't know who we are. How is this movie not a perfect description what is truly going on?",negative

"""The Skin I Live In"" is such a weird film that will make you feel uncomfortable the whole time and by the end, it'll make you say: ""WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH?!"".The film is shockingly great in so many different ways especially when it gets to the second half of it. The first half of the film might seem boring, slow, and typical. But, the second half fixes all of that.The cast was all brilliant and an excellent choice especially Antonio Banderas who played the role of that weird/mysterious surgeon perfectly. And of course, Elena Anaya, and Marisa Paredes were shockingly great and it was my first (perhaps only) time seeing them in any film or show.The screenplay is very well written. Loved how the film jumps back in time (sometimes back & forth quickly) to explain things without any confusion. It also answers every question the audience has. This is for sure the strongest element in the film.The directing, cinematography, and production design were not as great as many other films which is bad cause these are some of the strongest elements in any film and I do care about them a lot. This is why I gave the film a rating of 8.5/10 and not higher. I was trying so hard to find a few shots that are stunning to boost my rating. But, couldn't find any which made me a little sad cause I really enjoyed every second of the film and really wanted to give it a higher rating.If you're into an uncomfortable, weird, shocking film/story.

"The Skin I Live In is not a bad movie, but if you have seen at least 3 or more Almodovar's movies, then this one has no elements of surprise for the viewer. Because of that, I didn't like it that much. It is Almodovar all right, and everything in movie screams his name, but because of that, there wasn't any satisfaction at the end. The moment when Robert found Norma under the tree and she broke down I knew, from previously seen Almodovars's movies, how this one is going to end/ who represents whom. It's too predictable and at the end that predictability ruined the whole experience of this movie (for me). Soundtrack is compelling and a great addition to the movie.",negative
"While with some memorable scenes of punishment, and better than average (these neo-Blair-witch-hand-held days) Photography/scene effort certainly added stars, it has a limited or simplified range of dynamics and realisms between the main characters , and some silly or unexplained plot-devices , in order to bring the drama back to the main characters.Could've easily been a on-stage drama before going to film, and as a person who's comfy on the couch movies-first ... i think it should STAY there.too many unrealistic acceptances of others'-change , and personally, i find those in movies that sometimes quite IRRESPONSIBLE.toughened fashion and beauty industry artists / employees/ers ... could also recognize quite easily the absurdities for the sake of the drama. while that CAN be OK for the purposes of the portrayal of the dynamics of the relationships, it does not work well when one has not understood the plot BEFORE going and seeing it...which is WHEN ... many/most actually decides to go physically see, a drama, instead of only HEARING about it , in your city, going around your country, wherever.MOVIES... by comparison ... are things now view-able and downloadable, and whatnot , in a much more...

"La Piel que Habito is the new movie by the famous Spanish cult gone mainstream film director, Pedro Almodóvar. Pedro decided not only to experiment with psychotropic drugs this time but also with movie genres. This is the first thriller he directs and Ι can assure you that he did a great job. He manages to attach his soap dramatic cheesiness and awkwardness onto a seemed to be typical Hollywood thriller. The plot revolves around Antonio Banderas in Toledo, who's a grieving plastic surgeon, recently lost his wife, enclosed to himself in his mansion to do scientific research on humans. He is seen having captured a mysterious and hot woman in a room of his big house with CCTV support, watching her like a creep. The mystery unfolds throughout the movie and contains themes like sexual assaults, costumed rape sex, psychological trauma and sex, transgenesis, confusion over sexual orientation, opium smoking, obsession, frontal female nudity, yoga and murder. Someone might assume that this will feel like Human Centipede but it is much scarier than that when it comes to its tragedy. For those interested they can read my spoiler tagged text below. Almodovar probably based his whole movie screenplay on this scene idea/joke mentioned below in strikethroughLater on the film, the character of Vicente is introduced, who works at his mum's dress shop along with this cute girl that can be seen in the photo above. I'll type the next clause into a different font in order not to spoil it for you. Do not read if you haven't watched the film *SPOILER ALERT* So this girl is thinking of going to a party and Vicente shows her a dress he thinks it would look sexy on her and that she should wear it. The girl then responds '' You wear it! ''. Then later on the movie, 6 years have passed, and Vicente wakes up with vaginoplasty done on him. *SPOILER END* I couldn't help but notice the resemblance between Vicente and Alex Tzorvas (former Panathinaikos goalkeeper, Greece's National Team and Palermo's present gk)Male viewers will get goosebumps from the movie's material , as it bears the worst nightmare ever to happen to a straight man. Every young female character featured in the film is way hot and the film overall would score a high score in Mr.Skin. Summing up, this is a splendid and really enjoyable movie despite its extreme content that pervs and peeps with humor will adore. Two and half out of five is what this film deserves in the pointless meter.

"I love Almodovar, but this certainly didn't provide any of the immediate warmth, havoc, or diegesis that to me locate his overall style. It's a tightly wound, typically audacious medical thriller with horror elements (ugh! my least favourite) that still ends up being a triumph of humanity over morality in a way that seems distinctly Pedro.Enough people have discussed the plot, I'll just say that it felt more rewarding to me when comparing it to Greek mythology - while the pacing and characterisations are certainly fulfilling, at its core it is a ruthless analysis of the archetypal paradoxes of heterosexual male desire. It is in no way austere, but if read as an argument on the structure of heteronormativity it gains an added dimension.This is definitely not the feel-good Almodovar burying his philosophical gems under a beautifully soapy surface. It is a beautiful film, but seemingly attempting to sit in or disrupt a US Hitchcokian genre. A film that might be as challenging for the fan as the non-fan. One to leave you pondering the limits of humanity.",positive
"I have watched its trailer and it lead me to think of it as thriller. Those 2 minute footage encouraged me to give it a try without really knowing what to expect as Almodovar never directed a triller/suspense concept.Well,I don't really know how to rate this movie right now.I compared the first 50 minutes of it with ""Kill Bill"" from Tarantino with a mixture of raw humor.I felt like Almodovar had lost his mind this time and put together what the public would consider a very underrated movie.Well,at the minute 57 I was finally getting what direction he wanted us to follow.I believe Almodovar's ultimate goal was to play with the human mind maze in a very unexplored way and he most certainly achieves it. By the end of the movie, your own body is feeling all types of physic sensations and your brain is behaving in a way you won't recognize as yours.This movie is incredibly well directed and although you will find less of the Almodovar you are used to in it, it shows you the intelligence and directing skills you were waiting to see coming from him.I describe The skin I live in as very surreal and troubled dream - those that hunt us and let us play around with our deepest desires- The end: a very troublesome awakening for human morality and its acceptance of certain human behaviors and senses.In one word: superb.",positive
"Macabre and incredible.I loved the direction, and the story and development is most murky and disturbing, especially the final part.In the name of science very atrocious things have been done for the advancement of medicine, which are reflected in the story of this film. But all this is accompanied by a surgeon with a mind, in my opinion, disturbed by so many tragic events that have happened in his life.I'm still a little stunned, because it is a story that I did not expect at all, with this development and unexpected twists and turns that made it very strange to watch, but that has fascinated me.",positive
"The Skin I Live In""The things the love of a mad man can do."" Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro, Desperado) stars as the insanely committed Dr. Robert Ledgard in Pedro Almodóvar's 2011 The Skin I Live In. Taking place in Toledo, Spain, the story is about Dr. Ledgard's frightfully unlucky past pushing him to the extent of inventing a new synthetic skin that can withstand dangers such as fire and the bite of a mosquito, which could cause Malaria. In order to test his experiments, he uses a human being guinea pig, played by the strong, elegantly flawless Elena Anaya (Van Helsing, Talk to Her). Recently, Spanish cinema has acquired my interest due to movies such as Secuestrados and The Orphanage. The Skin I Live In is another Spanish film that keeps me wanting to watch more movies from this beautiful country. The reason why I enjoyed this film so much is because of the unfamiliar style of acting and the original yet accustomed narrative structure.When I hear of Antonio Banderas I think of the romantic, the man with a mask, the father, the puss in boots, but never in my right mind would I have seen him as the mad scientist who uses revenge in the most unhumanitarian way possible. Banderas takes an unorthodox acting style in this film, combining the emotion of revenge from Desperado with the deception of love from Original Sin. His character Dr. Ledgard, is the type of scientist who will stand up from breakfast to work on the project at hand; he plays the overly obsessive type of scientist. His insanity isn't one which is visible with ease, his subtle actions contemplate his madness. Banderas does a good job to show how affected he is by his past, not by his facial expressions but by the exceedingly amount of absurd activities that he brings about. In the film, Banderas' character has taken part of 3 out of 9 faceplant surgeries in the world, and this brief piece of information gives the audience a sense of how dedicated this character really is to his personal experiments. Without the fulfillment of Antonio Banderas, this film would be highly effected in loss without his striking acting abilities.The realistic yet merely formalistic narrative structure of The Skin I Live In lays out the basic genre pair of a drama and thriller. At first the film originality establishes the ground rules for the story, telling the audience who the weak imprisoned female victim is and what she can or can't do. Then Antonio Banderas' character is introduced immediately stating he is the doctor and has complete superiority. The story follows a well assembled path leading to the middle of the film settling the flashbacks which are necessary in order to understand how Elena Anaya's character becomes the highly valued captive. The flashbacks inform the audience of information that not even characters in the film know, this may seem like a disappointment but it only heightens the tension. The climax for the film touches on all the newly gathered information and combines it to create one of the most powerful endings I have ever watched.The Skin I Live In is a troubling controversial film that touches up on a lot of scientific knowledge mixed with the intensities that every drama should carry. Antonio Banderas as the antagonist was perplexing to watch but ended up being one of the best performances I have ever seen by him. Elena Anaya who plays the curious yet vigorous femme fatale set a very superb first impression on me and I would love to view another one of her performances. The dark, unsettling feeling that this film sends off, is definitely a film that everyone from the ages of 18 and up should witness. This is Spanish Cinema at its best. 4.5/5 - Marcel Urena",positive
"The less you know about this film before watching the more fun you'll have.This film is Almodovar homage to 1960s horror films. Personally I feel the film is actually more SciFi than horror with human-pig skin hybrids that are flame retardant (and also a total red-herring). There's a lot going on, it's almost as if Almodovar had all these great ideas but didn't know what to do with them and put it all in a blender. The nonlinearity plot is clever because it makes the viewer have feelings for Vera that perhaps they might not have if they knew everything from the start (or perhaps they still would?). Elena Anaya brings an incredible sense of delicateness and fragility but also toughness to the part of Vera. Almodovar is such an experience director that the film looks and feels both beautiful and effortless. Everything looks like it's straight out of Architectural Digest. There's eye-candy aplenty, mostly with Antonio Banderias playing the role of a rich, suave, egotistical, but also dangerously obsessive plastic surgeon. He's so handsome that I'm sure some of the audience will envy the object of his desires, Vera - perhaps that's Almodovar's idea.The final scene is great. I felt a bit sorry for Vicente though. But I don't feel that sorry because as Spanish horror master Paul Naschy once said ""Someone always has to suffer for our pleasures"".",negative
"I noticed what seems to set this one apart from the other ones of his I've seen was a much more muted color palette, although it seemed to fit the tone of this feature more than any of his others.
This one moves away from his usual dark humor and focus solely on the dark, but still delivers solidly.",positive
"I came across this movie on a ""Movies That Are So Clever They'll Have You Thinking For Days"" and this one is going to have me thinking for days. The only word I can fathom after seeing it is just...WOW.This is a mind eff of a movie if I've ever seen one. The beginning starts off decent, I found myself thinking 'ok this is decent so far but predictable. So he's created some test tube/petri dish woman. Just some scientist gone mad because he wife died from tragic inferno stress.' Then the story diverts to a young man in the woods with the daughter. Okay, still can we get back to the main plot? I don't care about this stupid kid.AND then the twist. WOW. Did I take a long, hot shower after? Yes. Do I feel mentally violated? Yes. Are there any words to describe the feeling once that twist hit? No. Jaw-dropping, gut-wrenching, just wow...Somehow you feel as though you're living in the walls of his house. Watching this crazy story unfold, helpless to do anything yet still watching. Mind = blown. This is definitely in my top five 'best movies of all time' list. I love movies that make me think, and this will definitely make the mind juices flow.",positive
What a brilliant concept. Nice movie to watch worth of time. Paybacking of Revenge heavy,negative
"Almodovar has lied to us when he made this movie. He took his big fat check directly home and he sighed with relief when he read those sycophantic reviews which made him look like a god of nowadays' cinematography. It wasn't enough to impale our eyes with obvious heavy product placement such as: almost the same car brand everywhere in the movie, home video technology provided by you know who, make up, furniture, clothes coming obviously from a direct sponsor... he had to put a woman to act as a transsexual!!!...I mean, come on, you want to hide it all behind the curtain of art, aesthetics, psychology and other noble intellectual and spiritual human concerns, but the whole point of your work is to glorify and deify plastic surgery because, maybe, some medical corporation has showered you with cash! And the trick is so cheap: you changed your pawn with the queen I have captured when I went out and you pretended to play high quality chess when I came back! Disappointed, I give this a 4/10 because of the great camera work and background music",negative
"A mix of dark thriller, surrealism, and the quirky absurdity which is a hallmark of Almodovar tales, this riveting film will please most viewers who love independent fare. The characters in this story were fascinating, yet there was something lacking in their development, and this could have been purposeful. The production design was finely rendered, with subdued, icy tones in certain scenes. The music was also a standout, and contained a lovely variance of genres.Why only 7 stars? This film did not pack the punch I wanted. The actors were consistently wonderful, but something in the core story did not sway me. Part of the plot seemed genuine, and other parts were futuristic. It was this jittery relationship between the two approaches which did not convince me to surrender.",positive
"I want to openly celebrate this film for how it is able to continually lure you into comfortably thinking you have a grasp of the situation and then completely upturning the entire context of what you've just witnessed, yet what unfolds is so sickening that I'm almost nauseous thinking about it. Pedro Almodóvar does not explore the darkest human behaviour to emphasis the light; he does not orchestrate a grand tragedy of abduction, enslavement, rape, grotesque scientific experiments, incestuous suggestions and sexual mania just to warmly reassure with optimistic triumph. He's not condemning anybody, even Antonio Banderas - who is so far removed from any image he ever cultivated as a suave Hispanic Clooney – a sociopathic scientist who evokes Doctor Génessier from 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960) more than anybody else, not just in his methods but his brutal persistence in willingly devastating anything around him to achieve his goals. He's losing constantly, losing the trust, admiration, love of those around him, losing control; his human experiment Elena Anaya who he observes in his living room through the one-way glass in her watching cell like a living artwork is losing constantly her identity as she is crafted by his will, losing the tether to her old self as she fails to escape her prison, his Mother a live-in maid is constantly losing her maternal grasp as she watches her family disassemble; it feels like everybody is by default losing until they can stop and win something. Even the ending doesn't promise anything. So what kind of burdensome descent into darkness is this? Well, it's not descent so much as it is a flaying. The film opens with Anaya exercising most dutifully in her small contained room, posing taut like a sculpture, and then as she receives her food from downstairs and talking to the Mother through an intercom. It's like a bustling hacienda as we see food being prepared, servants working, people communicating in all the ambiance of domesticity in what should be a normal household. But the film challenges our comfort with the scene with odd details that prevent this situation from being usual. Anaya receives her food via dumb-waiter, and downstairs she is being watched on multiple screens. And why does she wear that tight, flesh-toned one-piece, as if she is a human figure not yet finished in its creation? The film doesn't take long to reveal the circumstances of this living-arrangement, but then when we begin to think we understand what is happening and why the film peels back another layer. The film is strikingly composed like a Kubrikian pallet that burns intensely with certain colours, and if you thought red in the Shining was assaulting take a look at this. The film is so gorgeous in its art-exhibition style that there becomes a cognitive dissonance between the gawking that it elicits from you and the increasing repugnance of what is gradually being revealed, and even when the film is at its most clinical like Kubrick, there is so much abounding passion that it just leaves you dazed. Take the scene in which an assertive, perhaps unhinged man in a tiger costume appears at Banderas' home and tells the Mother that he's her son and he wants to come back into her life. She allows him in and he quickly devolves from assertive to perverted; and the whole thing appears like it's composed too rigidly for the sake of being lurid. But what's happening is important relationships are being tested at a level in which they shouldn't even exist, and the small details of the tiger costume are just realistic details of life; life doesn't stop in awareness of how peculiar it's being and modify itself so it appears normal. It's just f****d up. And this is Almodóvar, existing in the f****d up, in the most swollen- ready-to-burst Melodrama of life in which people exist in craziness and depravity way beyond ordinary boundaries, and it's as if he is gifting us this madness so we can delight in just how spectacular human behaviour is. Sometimes it feels like it doesn't know what to say or doesn't have anything to say and is doing what it's doing simply for the delight of the perverse, trying on different skins so to speak, but when it pulls back it's skins and reveals whole new truths that you hadn't even contemplated this film really does impact. And it's pulling back those skins that reveal how successful the film is. It wasn't a deception, an elaborate magic trick in which the skin peeling was nothing but provocation eventually to peel back and to nothing but air. Underneath the film is flesh, real substance, and you can look at it and marvel at the creation, and honestly say to yourself as every fortunate human has at some point: ""Has there been a better time to be alive?""",negative
"I would characterize the movie as a perverse one, but I didn't found it bad, nor brilliant. That's why I rated the movie with a 7, even though it is not one of my favorite subjects.
A different theme approached by Pedro Almodóvar.
If someone has power and can manipulate, it is more than sure he will do it because he can, especially if he is driven by revenge as in this doctor's case played by Antonio Banderas.
But thinking he can manipulate the soul, or someone's behavior and not only his appearance has turned out to be a mistake eventually.
Some scenes are monotonous in the middle of the film, but the beginning and the end are quite thrilling.",positive
What's so brilliant about this film is the true horror is what everyone does to each other and not the violence or gore itself. That being said the films twist is disgusting and as shocking as can be.The film is also a great exploration of grief and revenge and the extraordinary lengths it can push us to.All in all a horror but not as you know it.,positive
"The Skin I Live In, is masterfully directed master piece. Telling a story far to often forgotten about The Skin I Live In does not hesitate when it comes time to show what we need to see, in order to really feel the effects of the film. The Skin I Live in is not just a film but an experience!9/10",positive
"Death, sex, gender and relationships between mother and offspring: all Almodovar's perennial themes permeate this film. Death: The story revolves around a surgeon and his mother, brother, wife and daughter, all of whom are dead, by various unnatural means, by the end. Sex: None of these five has a straightforward sexual history, with their participation in and response to clandestine liaisons and/or attempted rape central to the unfolding narrative. Gender: The sixth main character, unrelated to the five, is both a man and a woman in different parts of the film and as one or the other is involved in problematic sexual liaisons with three of the five. Mother: This sixth character's relationship with his/her mother is a significant part of the story, as are three of the family members' relationships with their mothers. The plot is absurd, as are the characters, and the viewing often uncomfortable. Yet somehow, through original and powerful direction and acting, the film is gripping and memorable. Without trying to explain an inexplicable plot, the mixed and changing motives to the bizarre actions of the surgeon (Antonio Banderas) provide a compelling progression to the plot. Money, grief, guilt, jealousy, desire, revenge and scientific curiosity all feature at some point in explaining his behaviour. His fatal mistake is the one occasion when he's prepared to cede control by trusting someone. If you've been captivated by other Almodovar films, you need to see this to keep track of how he both continues with and diverges from his past. If you're seeing this as an Almodovar virgin, prepare to be fascinated by and admiring of his film-making, if unpersuaded by the sheer weirdness of it.",negative
"This is easily my favourite Spanish language thriller, with Abres Los Ojos coming second, and if wasn't for Alfred Hitchcock, I'd possibly claim this to be my favourite thriller of them all.This is a ""mad doctor"" thriller/horror with the style of Dead Ringers and the imagination of Frankenstein rather than the crudeness and schoolboy humour of Human Centipede. Antonio Banderas shows how to play a calm and calculating mad scientist without ever hamming it up, remaining believable and utterly terrifying. If you have friends on Facebook who enjoy spoiling movies, then praise the fact that they are probably not intelligent enough to watch a subtitled movie. In fact, watch this before the studio sells out and the inevitable American remake is made - I wonder if it would be better or worse for Antonio Banderas to reprise his role, à la Penelope Cruz in Vanilla Sky since I feel like coming back would be compromising the original's existence yet I can't imagine another actor playing that role as competently. Speaking of Vanilla Sky, I can understand (to a degree) the insistence on a remake due to some of the low budget make up effects, however, The Skin I Live In (La Piel Que Habito) has none of these shortcomings of the original, due to the low budget, but for this film I cannot actually think of a single thing which would improve it even though it had a few moments which felt slow (the reason for the pacing becomes apparent as the film progresses, much like Abres Los Ojos).",positive
"All i can say about this movie is that it made me sick in the end... in the beginning ,it made you believe that it was just a movie about a mad scientist desperately trying to find a cure for his hurt wife...but Almodovar showed his magic and changed the game of the rules to the end of the movie... i was quite shocked after learning who the woman was...When the director revealed this fact kept hidden from the audience until to the very end of the movie, he played one of the the biggest tricks on the audience similar to the one i last saw in the crying game...It felt like a punch in my stomach and i literally felt as if i ate spoiled chicken and had to force myself to keep the things in my stomach coming out....I hated what happened in the movie with all my cells and i am sorry i had to endure such a feeling which i least expected....so i must warn you, don't watch this movie if you only watch a movie to enjoy yourself and have a good time, believe me, you will thank me later Yet, i must congratulate the director for depicting his twisted,insane and inhumane thoughts to the big picture very successfully and creating such strong emotions inside me even though they are only hate, the urge to hurt someone and nausea so it is a great film for art's sake but takes a strong stomach to appreciate this kind of art",positive
"I saw a title of a previous IMDb review of this film with the summary, ""Twisted, Depraved and Good."" And basically, that could be all you had to know about this film going in to like it.Oscar-Winner Pedro Almodovar, who has made a career out of making strange films that tackle subject matter most other filmmakers would avoid, has really outdone himself this time, and he could be headed for another Academy Award for Best Foreign Film come next February.I am going to give as little information and as little spoilers as possible so as to allow any of you the same experience I had going in. The film works much better that way. Much like Citizen Kane, which has sections of the film that represent other genres, The Skin I Live In crosses many genres - horror, drama, suspense.Basically, Antonio Banderas plays Dr. Robert Ledgard, a sort of modern-day Frakenstein-type surgeon, who is experimenting on making his own kind of ""skin"" for cosmetic surgery to burn victims. He experiments on a young woman, Vera Cruz (played by the beautiful Elena Anaya, whom he unbelievably keeps locked in the basement. We know nothing of Elena's past.However, each of the main character's back stories and origins, so to speak, are revealed in Flashbacks and this really adds to the movie itself. No matter what the Dr. Ledgard does to Vera, he can't kill the beauty inside of her. This is all I wish to write, so as to keep the viewing experience for future film goers perfect.I will end on this note: When the film ended, I wanted more. What more can you say about a movie than that?",positive
"Almost every film I have seen from this director have seemed shockingly weird to me... you probably know what I mean.Well, I went to the cinema with certain skepticism... I didn't know exactly what I was going to see with this film.Whoa! Forget about all those topics from previous Almodóvar films... this is simply a good thriller. There's no boring plot about housewives in trouble, no loads of transvestites or eccentric characters, no PENÉLOPE CRUZ (again), no crude humor...Well, it is a disturbing film in fact, but in the good way. People who don't know anything about the plot will enjoy it the most. It has a really shocking plot twist. You don't know anything about the woman who is in that room, and you start to wonder...In my case, I thought it would leave me without answers or without getting the plot, but after the flashback, all the pieces start to fit and you are easily able to understand the whole thing, and that's pretty satisfying for me.Apart from this, I really like how homosexuality (or rather, transsexualism) is dealt here without ridiculous or humiliating stereotypes (I think this is the first time in a film from Almodóvar), and I love both Anaya and Cornet, who help to break the disgusting Spanish/Latino stereotype (aren't they white enough...?)Manuel Pérez.",negative
You will be blinded about what is happening during the first scenes of the movie but in the end it has full of surprises.,positive
"A long leap from his iconic role as feisty feline Puss in Boots, Banderas reunites with six-time collaborator Almodóvar in The Skin I Live In, a beautifully shot thriller with subtle horror overtones. Although the original premise already guarantees unusual viewing, director Almodóvar still manages to throw many twists and turns at the audience, including a climax that challenges all viewers not to be shocked. Banderas is on top form as the widowed scientist. Paredes is impressive in her supporting role as the deceitful maid, but it is Anaya as the secret test subject who shines in each scene.Complimented by its stunning cinematography and lavish design but let down by its uncomfortable graphic violence, The Skin I Live In delivers its promise: a dark, stylish, smart horror that will divide the opinions of viewers internationally.",positive
"I liked the movie. It is kind of dark but I loved the idea. It is new and no one has gone there before.My review will be short because I will only say what I want to say. To the people who didn't watch the movie don't read this or the movie will be spoiled to you by me. I will sum the story, then I am going to tell the alternate ending, and in the conclusion the glamorous of that ending and why the movie should has had it.The plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (played by Banderas) saves his wife from the fire which caused by his brother (Zeca) whom Robert didn't know that he is his brother. A guy, Vicente (played by Jan Cornet) rapes his daughter. His wife and daughter are dead. Absolute tragedy! But he managed to kidnap the Vicente and to transform him into the sex and shape of his wife. Robert sees his brother who caused his wife accident raping the guy (Vicente) who is wearing the shape of his wife (Vera Cruz), and he (Robert) kills him (Zeca). Somehow the doctor managed to love the shape of his wife whom inside his wife rapist. Then the take advantage of the moment and kills the doctor and his nanny (Marilia) and goes to his mother. The end.What I want to say that I have a good alternate ending. The mother of the guy should be the nanny of Robert. Imagine that the lady is mourning over her lost son (Vicente) then Robert does his work on her son. And after a while he summons her to take care of him as Vera. The son who is wearing the wife form can't see his mother watching him over the screen. Robert kills his brother (Zeca) then when the guy (Vicente) kills Robert. The nanny Marilia (the guy's mother) will break into the room and murder her son (Vicente) thinking that she has finally revenged her other son (Zeca).In that way, it would be rather hilarious and ironic. The brother rapes a brother thinking that it was the other brother's wife. A mother kills a son thinking that she is revenging her other son death. A father sleeps with a man wearing the flesh of his wife.In life I believe that every body should have his own and full chance in life and certainly not to die early before his or her time. But since the author has already killed the doctor who had a huge tragedy, I think he shouldn't let the guy who raped his daughter free. The doctor did nothing wrong, even his revenge was sweet, and his life is a mess. I think the alternate ending has more justice that the original.",positive
"Pedro Almodovar likes to uncover and expose sexuality. We are used to see homosexual and transsexual characters in his movies. This is no exception.A doctor (Robert) seems to have a relation with a patient (Vera). This doctor is a well- known plastic surgeon. We leave this plan, and go backwards in time, to the early beginnings of the story. Robert used to have a wife, who had an accident which left her body burned. This wife, committed suicide when she realised that the burnings had disfigured her.Robert's daughter (Norma), witnessed the suicide. We see Norma later in the film, as a very unbalanced woman. Norma spends time in a mental institution, until the doctor advises Robert that Norma needs to socialise. There is a party at Robert's, and Norma meets a boy (Vicente). She gets into a kind of rape situation, which leads to her suicide, some days later. Robert, who saw Vicente leaving the party, enraged by his daughter's death , wants to take action.He kidnaps Vicente, with some kind of vengeance in mind .He isolates Vicente in his house, and slowly transforms him in a woman, starting with a vaginoplasty. Vicente ends up being almost identical to Robert's deceased wife. My assumption is that Robert lives with a mix of emptiness and failure. He loved his wife, and failed at reconstructing his wife's skin, which lead to her death. After loosing his daughter, he kidnaps Vicente, and sees him as a way out; a way to continue his failed work; A way to save his wife; Shockingly, he reconstructs his wife, in Vicente's body, and even gets into a relation with him/her. This is a brilliant story, which appeals to the impact of our image. The skin where we live is more than just our skin; it's our identity. Having the power to change it , we may end in the the loss of ourselves; And we will never be the person we want to be. Never. Robert wanted Vera to become his wife. He ended up being killed by the person who looked like his wife, but wasn't really his wife. Can we really change what we are?",negative
"This is something I did not expect from Almodovar. Although the trailer did give me a hunch for what I was to expect regarding the atmosphere and the mere basics of the plot and the characters, nothing could have prepared me for the full story that developed on the screen - a fascinating tale of revenge, and revenge within a revenge; a movie in and out of every plausible category you could think of, masterfully and meticulously crafted just like all the previous movies by this director, a true genius of modern cinema.And yet something was missing, and I must confess this much to my displeasure. Comparing it with most other films by Almodovar, this one, unfortunately, did not play with the winning combination that is so much cherished by Almodovar fans. ""The Skin I Live In"" lacked the sensibility that has made his other films so appealing, loving, and unforgettable. Maybe even ""winning combination"" is not a good way to describe the pattern of his films - it is the themes he's best at embodying, the stories that are his own, when you can sense through the screen that he himself is saying what the characters are saying. To me, ""The Skin I Live In"" failed to achieve this. Almodovar put himself in a different skin to make this film and hence created something different - he created 'an attempt' as an attempt to make something perfect.But still, I do not want to be too critical. After all, his signature is present and very much evident. True admirers of Almodovar's work, such as myself, will still enjoy this inordinary extraordinary film as an attempt at something new, something different from him. Fans will always be wanting to see another ""Volver"", ""All About My Mother"" or ""Talk to Her"", but who is to say that he 'must' stick to his guns? Experiments are always welcome and Almodovar should be no exception. In the future, it will be this exact variety in his cinematic opus that will be cherished and considered worthy and inspiring.",negative

"The movie starts off a bit stagnantly, but later becomes immensely gripping. It is a masterpiece, both artistically and scenario-wise. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the flashbacks and how they play with our sense of reality, together they create a unique, unusual piece of art.

"I am a movie buff, and i do catch up with the best directorial works, in a way i wish to see all the works of one particular director. as for example the Korean films director Kim ki duk, just like that our very own Clint Eastwood, so there is a list of real great workers who leave your mind boggling, Pedro Almodóvar has given us talk to her, the man with out past, and i have seen this one the skin i live in as my latest adventure. this director makes you feel the revenge the grit, and the emotions to the core and will leave your mind boggling. thus i titled my review as bizarre, as such i am also a doctor so for me it was easy to understand this movie. Yes of course the movie is for a particular sect of society called the Intellects. Thanks Mr. Pedro Almodóvar",positive
"The Skin I live In, an enigmatic film created by one of the best filmmakers of today, Pedro Almodovar. This work shows many influences of the director and scriptwriter, as Hitchcock, reference in the suspense films until today. Despite its original story, epic score and powerful performances, the film does not come close to perfection, but balances itself on the string.Directed and written for the big screen by Pedro Almodovar, The Skin I Live In is a thriller, with traces of horror and drama. Almodovar manages to hit very well in his direction, creating a crazy (but good) environment for the story. He is one of the only directors who can turn such a dense story into pure art. Seeing it with your own eyes is beautiful.The point that caught my attention in the work was the magnificent score. What is that? Composed by the most excellent Alberto Iglesias, it accentuates the emotions and deepens the suspense. His thunderous sound is key to the plot, bringing a complete sound experience.
The main duo also shows their qualities. Highlight for Antonio Bandeira, playing a brilliant role of crazy. The rest of the cast leaves something to be desired. They all seem to be actors in Mexican novels, with no emotion or desire, just to plug holes.The photograph, although simple, manages to capture the beauty of the film, with cameras static and silent, with the merit of the direction, that knew very well to use this resource in their favor.I had my troubles with the film, especially with the script. It was poorly planned, there was not a balance between the information, it was all at once, without pity the viewer who received a stash of data in the head. The main character loses some of his credibility in the end, his motivations are confused, without head and tail.Apart from the discomfort with plot planning, editing was the other thing that messed up the film. It did not flow very well, some scenes were too long, unnecessary and unimportant. In the end, it was very perforated, a feeling of unnecessary rhythm and useless for the plot.In the end, The Skin I Live In, manages to bring a reasonable experience, with elements missing or going overboard. It could have been much better, had potential, but had an oversight, so a drop in quality.
Worth watching if you like an original story and suspense.",positive
"How was it? I dozed a bit in the middle of the film, but I was tired and that did not sit well with the afternoon projection and the middle part of movie is a bit stretched. It's true Almodovar, beautifully shot, strong colors, full of fools at edge of breaking. My wife was shocked by the sensless violence and commented that before Almodovar had loved his characters",positive
"This is my personal opinion only. This film is right in so many ways. It has the perfect amount of bizarre to satisfy my needs, and Almodovar's timing in unraveling the plot is bang on. The plot line and characters are so convincing that it is sometimes hard not to absolutely Believe what is happening in front of our own eyes. I love the director teasing us, with little hints hidden in the lines or decor that recall the different themes across the film. The performance is great (Elena Anaya and Antonio Banderas as a modern time Pygmalion) and the end has a subtle twist that make you see the film in a whole new perspective.",positive

"I've been meaning to watch this film for some time, but knowing that it might be confronting have put if off. Confronting it was... If you read through the reviews on IMDb you will find a lot of people telling you it's a horror film along the 'silence of the lambs' vein. Although it has that element, I found the film to be a complex look into the unhealthy way in which men relate to women. Whether it be the animalistic 'tiger' predator, the man who puts women up on a pedestal by objectifying the 'perfect woman', the young 'accidental' rapist, the son who treats his mother as a servant or the incestuous father, most women will identity with at least one of the creepy relationships in this film.If you consider yourself a feminist, it will test you. How far would you go to obtain revenge? What would it take to teach a man what we, as women, go through? Who is in charge of teaching that lesson? It opens up so many questions, which to me is the mark of a great film.",positive
"The main story of the movie is what Robert does to Vincent but we are distracted by some marginal stories that I believe they could be eliminated without much hurt to the plot and instead spend more time on Vera/Robert relations.
From the moment that Robert starts to trust Vera, a question rises that is Vera trustable or she will revenge from Robert. But this suspension lasts very small amount (i think like 15 min in the movie) while if the marginal stories of the plot (such as tiger relations with Robert wife) which takes a lot of time from story, was eliminated, there would be more time to build on the suspension of Vera/Robert relationship.",negative
"The skin i live in is from the films that you do not find every day and trust me this is good,the film starts and you don't know what is going to happen and can not guess the end and this combination make this film a perfect movie!this film play with your mind and human values,perfectly black horror that make to you to ask your self a lot of things,with very nice script, Antonio Banderas its at his best and of course the direction is by Pedro Almodóvar the key for the success!Is from the movies that you should see in your live because as i said doesn't happen every day to make such a good and clever movie like this,turn of the lights and enjoy!!",positive
It's my first Pedro Almodóvar's movie.i decided to watch other movies.İ have too much emotion while watching movie.That is power of movie.Most of users say acting is perfect especially Antonio Banderas(Robert).İ agree with them but beyond the acting the scenario is very well structured.,positive

"'The Skin I Live In' (2011) - Another triumphant film by Pedro Almodovar Thinking back, I think it was Almodovar's 'Tie me up, Tie me down' (1990) that was the first foreign film, certainly the first Spanish film, that truly excited me and made me realise that there were contemporary film-makers elsewhere in Europe that had a vision that was quite extraordinary and one-of-a-kind, a breath of fresh air from stodgy (but enjoyable) British cinema. It was during an A-Level Spanish lesson that this film was shown to me as a break from language and vocabulary-learning. Just as when 'The Mission' (1986) was shown to me during a Geography lesson (randomly part of plate tectonics), this moment turned into a cinematic occasion that I would never forget. Today, twenty-one years after 'Tie me up', Almodovar's films continue to bring me a huge amount of joy. They are always original and stylish, have a superbly crafted script and an inspired cast to mount these words onto the screen. I know it is not the politically-correct turn of phrase to describe Almodovar's characters and narrative as like that of a 'circus' as he often deals with important issues such as transgender identity, homosexuality and transvestite lifestyle but I do feel that it does summon up the correct sense of large, often theatrical, set pieces accompanied by extravagant characters with dramatic acts to perform. However, where circus life is often equated with the 'freak show', or meaningless but entertaining performance, or else old-fashioned ideas of what constitutes something foreign or exotic, where human characters are superficially rendered and posed for audience naïve enjoyment, in Almodovar's cinematic canvases the characters are far from skin-deep (sorry about this pun), far more than their sexuality or habits. His films show a new tolerant modernity emerging where being foreign to the norm is a characteristic we all inhabit and something we can all enjoy together.'The Skin I Live In' is a classic piece of Almodovar pie. It tells the story of a brilliant plastic surgeon, Robert, (played by Antonia Banderas) who due to the scarring of his wife in a car accident with her lover (and subsequent suicide due to her horror at her own visage) begins an unhealthy obsession with skin and muscle manipulation and transplantation. From a viewing of the trailer, immediately a 'Frankenstein' story springs to mind and one wonders whether this will be an Almodovar take on this classic story. However, this assumption would be wrong and the product of, frankly, an ineffective trailer. Robert's surgical obsession finds form in the victim of Vera (played beautifully by Elena Ananya), a test subject held captive upstairs in his mansion home and private surgery premises. We learn early in the film that Elena has been moulded (physically and mentally) to be who she is today though to what extent one only understands as the story unravels. We note from characters such as his faithful, though morally questionable, housekeeper and accomplice, Marilia, that Vera has an amazing resemblance to his late wife. Naturally I do not want to give away the story and spoil this delicious tale for you. My intention is only to describe the talent of Almodovar as he is able to take a seed idea like this and build multiple stories and implied meta-stories to complicate this basic line and show the varieties of motives always involved in one person's act and the spectrum of routes that we, the audience, can view that same act. For instance we hear of Robert's daughter many years back committing suicide, unable to deal with her mother's suicide at her feet and her erroneous belief that her father, Robert, raped her. We learn of the housekeeper, Marilia, being both the secret mother of Robert and the mother of the man who stole Robert's wife and left her burning in a crashed car as he fled. When she says that her womb gives birth to insanity, the words ring in our ears and we truly feel for her though, strangely, simultaneously distrust her. We can't help but feel the mother must be like her sons. We meet the runaway son, a conventional madman, juxtaposed with the elegance and poise that the plastic surgeon brings to the same psychosis. He is dressed in a tiger suit straight from the carnival (this is not a euphemism; he literally is coming from a Spanish carnival). Further afield in the local town we meet the actual rapist of his daughter, Vicente. Unlike what one would expect, he is a soft-natured, talented seamstress and tailor at a local fashion boutique who appears to, on the one hand, be in love with or at least admire his lesbian colleague in a shy, schoolboy manner and, on the other hand, drop pills, ride a motorcycle and roll around the party scene with his attractive male friends looking for girls. Even his lesbian colleague and his mother, both fleeting characters for the most part, have stories attached to them through the director's insinuation. One wonders whether a relationship is there between the two, even though they are years apart. We never know but we wonder due to subtle little moments of intimacy between the two women. This makes us wonder whether Vicente is attracted to his colleague because she is the sexual interest of his mother or because he feels usurped by her as the apple of his mother's eye. The mother is cunningly counter-posed against Marilia, the housekeeper. This is not made blatant. I don't think they are ever in a scene together. But they are the same age and where Vicente's mother comes across as a dutiful, loving woman, the other comes across as epitomising motherhood as a perversity; where a son's psychosis is allowed to run riot due to the enabling love of his mother.Continued in Part Two of this review...

"How do I begin to describe this movie? The Story was very original something that I haven't seen till this day. It had many elements but to my surprise they were all balanced,there was Love,grief,Vengeance,a bit of sci-fi,a pretty messed up family and of course the mad scientist. It was really unpredictable in fact at the middle of the movie I was pretty shocked and that rarely happens when I watch a movie. The superb acting of the well known actor Antonio Banderas adds another point to this thriller.As an Antonio Bandaras fan I have to say it was one of his greatest works. I usually don't watch thriller-mystery movies so this was my first a pretty good movie to start with for you guys who want to try this genre.",positive
"Like a plastic surgeon, Almodovar has treated this patient of a movie with meticulous care. And thus, the result.",positive
Watching the movie is very interesting. It was so beauteful.,positive
"This is the first film I saw from this Director..and it was a surprise, really good movie.",positive
This movie is just awesome. Please do watch this movie at least for once.,positive
I saw a review of Almodovars latest work on the web and thought I'd give it a try. I'm not what you would call a hardcore fan of his work but I am aware he is let's say disturbing at least.So the movie began sure enough and I was quite quickly taken in by the stunning visuals and also the storyline seemed clever enough so I began to enjoy the movie. But after a while I realized I was too familiar with the plot and then it seemed like I was having a deja-vu of sorts. And suddenly it hit me. This movie is a liberal adaptation of a novel I've read years ago by a french writer Thierry Jonquet. The novel is called Mygale or Tarantula as it was translated in English and although the film's narrative doesn't stick to the novel's faithfully and all the character's names have been changed the story is pretty much the same. The novel is an obscure one so not really easy to find but I would suggest reading it. It's much more disturbing than the movie.,positive
"it is the kind of move that keeps you at the end of it for few seconds with a strange and serious smile on the face. I suspect that Norma was actually treated in the same way on which Vincent was:there is an attraction between Norma and Vincente and Norma's reaction was strange when they were together. The madness she went into mast have a deeper reason than a failure sexual abuse. All this time she/he was trying to embrace, adapt, learn the new way of being. That explains the reaction she had when her father found her in that state of mind. -she couldn't support her girl cloths and the high hills. -she killed herself without being even raped. -her mother kill herself because she knew that her child was something else... than the way she looked with all her burned skin. Vincente keeps his state of mind focusing on other sort of things such as yoga and his passion for arts.Good movie.",positive
"This was Almodóvar's first movie for me. I watched the first half, and I have to say I almost gave up on it. The movie is quite fast in pace. It is dark and quite twisted in parts,telling the tale of an almost obsessive compulsive plastic surgeon (Antonio Banderas) and his quite warped way of dealing with issues stemming from his deceased wife and child.The film has some great scenes and quite enjoyable snippets of Spanish architecture and landscapes. It is a good snap shot of the life of the plastic surgeon, who is both wealthy and seemingly opium addicted. The movie is quite simply eccentric. Through its eccentricities it does become disturbing in parts. What I found difficult to view were the sex scenes, which at times border lined on rape. It was not until the second half of the film that the necessity of these scenes hit home.It is a dark film which covers a lot of subject matter. The acting is excellent by both Antonio and Elena Anaya (Vera). A bit hard to get into at the start, but definitely worth the watch.",positive
"What is it? A modern dark and melancholic tale. Something you have never seen before, and that will surprise you from start to finish. Disturbing at times, but not quite shocking in my honest opinion. I strongly suggest you to watch this in Spanish with English subs.The acting is very good too, putting this movie on the top of Antonio Banderas C.V. The soundtrack is also a blast from the opening credits to the generics. I'm just starting to watch more foreigners movies now and I must say I enjoy it very much. This is deserving a very high 9 out of 10 because of the authenticity and the originality. I can't believe what I just saw.",positive
"Such a great movie, kinda disturbing but I loved it. Great job.",positive
