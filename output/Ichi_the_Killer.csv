review,sentiment
"Ichi the Killer is the story of a Yakuza gang run by Anjo, whom his underlings find missing (possibly killed) with 100 million yen gone as well. The functional head of Anjo's gang while he's absent is an off-the-wall sadomasochist named Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano). There is a former affiliate gang, now somewhat rivals, run by Fujiwara (Toru Tezuka), and there are a number of gang outcasts who hang out at a bar/brothel, with Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) as their head. Jijii is manipulating/grooming a bizarre killer named Ichi (Nao Omori), who is gradually taking out Anjo and Fujiwara gang members for him.If you haven't seen infamous Japanese cult film director Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer yet and you're considering it, there is one ""test"" that might make the decision easy for you--do you like fairly regular over-the-top violence, torture and gore? If that's enough to turn you on to a film, do not pass Ichi the Killer up--you're sure to love it. This is one of the most brutal and gory films I've seen, and yes, I've seen Andreas Schnaas films. However, if those things are enough to turn your stomach instead, you shouldn't come near this film with a two-foot needle.For me, I don't mind over-the-top violence, torture and gore, but that in itself isn't sufficient for me to like a film. Despite some admirable stylistic flourishes, including some very unique cinematography and editing as well as an unusual but extremely effective soundtrack, there were a number of things in Ichi the Killer that didn't quite work for me. I ended up liking the film, but just moderately. A 7 is a ""C"" in my rating system.One problem I had with the film, which might be clear from the description in my first paragraph, is that the plot isn't exactly easy to follow. Writer Sakichi Satô, adapting the script from a manga (Japanese comic) by Hideo Yamamoto, introduces a large number of characters in each scene, and we do not always get their names or very clear dialogue explaining who they are. There were quite a few characters for whom I was never very sure about their identity. In conjunction with this, the film didn't always flow as well as it should have. It tends to feel like long scenes of establishing exposition alternated with violence/torture showcases.But by the final ""act"", there are some very interesting revelations about characters and their relationships to one another. So it's not that the kernel of a good story isn't there. It's just told a bit awkwardly. This might not have been helped by the fact that Miike has stated that he was shooting for a kind of open-ended vagueness that is characteristic of Asian genre films. The impact of the revelations is somewhat dissolved by the time we get to the dénouement due to the intentional ambiguity.The beginning of Ichi the Killer employs a lot of extended cinematographic techniques in rapid succession ala Oliver Stone--different film speeds, stocks, tinting and processing methods, and so on. While these are interesting, Miike forgets about them quickly as he works his way into the story. They pop up occasionally later in the film, as do a couple shots in the vein of Dario Argento, such as a tracking shot through someone's ear. Even when more conventional, the cinematography and production design remain admirable throughout--I particularly liked the shot of Kakihara sitting in front of a red background, with his purple coat and green scarf, but there is a lot of outstanding visual composition in the film.Whether intended or not, Ichi the Killer frequently reads as more of a black (morbid) comedy. This is because the violence is so over-the-top that it is frequently cartoonish and ridiculous. Those are positive qualities in my book, but anyone looking for realism should beware. On the other hand, the emotional reactions from ""victims"" are fairly realistic throughout the film, including the fact that people do not die immediately after they are injured.But Miike's concern, as with his other films, is more surrealist. The behavior of the principal characters is particularly wacky, especially Ichi, who often seems borderline mentally deficient--he cries and cowers before he brutally attacks his victims, and has a very odd sexual dysfunction associated with his violence. Ichi is also portrayed as something akin to a superhero, and Miike constantly bounces back and forth between showing him as an admirable vigilante and an anti-hero. Kakihara, who is giving something of a venerable ""bad boy"" rock star/punk persona, is also almost a hero through much of the film, and he also has some bizarre sexual dysfunctions, as do a number of other characters. This is one of the main subtexts of the film; it isn't entirely dissimilar to the later A Snake of June (2002). There is also another character who undergoes something of a superhero transformation, as he sheds his public appearance and becomes a muscle-bound avenger near the climax.",positive
"Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" is a masterpiece of insane cinema.This film is surely challenging-filled with enough sadistic violence and rape to satisfy fans of Japanese harrowing cinema.It's based on the popular manga by Hideo Yamamoto.The character of Ichi is truly amazing-he is a mysterious figure who slices various individuals into numerous bloody pieces with razor sharp blades strapped to his boots.The gore is pretty extreme as Ichi literally slices people in half with his razor-sharp boots.The acting is surprisingly good-Nao Omori and Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Ichi and Kakihara.Highly recommended,especially if you have strong stomach.9 out of 10.",positive
"Ichi the Killer is definitely not a film for people who have weak stomachs or who are easily offended. This film contains some of the most shocking images you'll ever see and includes some very disturbing characters that won't be forgotten in a hurry. It is always a very brave move for a film maker when they decide to adapt from a manga as manga often has aspects within it that can not be replicated in to a live picture. Takashi Miike makes the transition possible and blows away all walls of reality with an outstanding and totally unforgettable film.The plot involves Yakuza boss Anjo going missing with a huge stash of cash, his gang members investigate and a classic game of cat and mouse is involved. This seems simple enough but what is out of the ordinary is that the leader of the investigation, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), is a major masochist and Anjo's killer, Ichi (Nao Omori) is the ultimate sadist with a tormented soul. This is where Ichi the Killer's shocking and graphic imagery really come in to force. Miike is uncompromising in his approach with regards to what he delivers on screen. There are no subtleties, no off camera goings on; it is all there for the audience to see, in full detail! The torture scenes, and their results, are especially horrific. If this film had been made in America or Europe, it would have been banned within a second of being made, it's that graphic. What disturbed me more than the disgusting imagery however, were the characters. Ichi's character I found genuinely terrifying as whilst he often comes across as a cartoonish character, there is a disturbingly real quality to his character. Ichi's childlike naivety draws many parallels to past psychotic killers that have existed in real life and his sexual excitement at causing pain and death is incredibly unsettling. Also unsettling is the character of Kakihara. His badly scarred face and clips either side of his lips immediately make him appear a scary figure and the only thing more disturbing than his pleasure for torturing others and watching their pain is his unparalleled love for being beaten and tortured himself.What I like about many Asian films is that the acting is often very good and Ichi the Killer is no exception. Tadanobu Asano is brilliant as Kakihara. His performance is charismatic and terrifying, he does a great job of making the role his own. Nao Omori plays Ichi perfectly. The way that he can act tormented, childish and merciless all in one scene is incredible to watch and, as I said before, gives the film a genuinely disturbing edge rather than just immense gore. Alien Sun is very sexy as Karen and the way she speaks more than one language in an almost random fashion adds further mystery to this film. The fact that Karen is the only character who has Ichi's past explained to her from Jijii makes the audience able to empathise with her character more than anyone else. Shinya Tsukamoto is also very good as Jijii. His character is unravelled throughout the film and Tsukamoto is very convincing in his portrayal of what turns out to be a very complex character.The purpose of this film is to shock and it achieves its goal to the point where you almost can not watch. With extremely graphic gore and some intense surrealist imagery that Salvador Dali himself would have been proud of, Ichi the Killer will never be forgotten and deserves to be watched by a lot more people (even if they can only watch it once!). Miike is very clever with his direction. The way he blends Kaneko's flash back sequences with the present does wonders to keep the audience's attention. The ending is also done with great style and is very effective in ending the film so it is down to interpretation of the audience.Despite being very hard to palate, Ichi the Killer is a fantastic film. Directing, acting, writing and score are all spot on and the quality of the film is very good. Not a film I could handle watching too regularly but definitely a film I'll want to watch a few more times in the future.",positive
"Ichi the Killer, is hands down the number one hardest film for me to sit through.... so far. The acting is so good, characters so charismatic, that you are compelled to keep watching. The story is about 2 characters, one a member of the mafia, the other a man without direction. Kakihara is expelled from the Yazuka gang for his methods, which are altogether too brutal for them - and takes over the Anjo gang. He is a sado masochist, who lives his death with a sort of destined death wish.. looking for the one who will be worthy to kill him.In a way it's a film about two extremes... desensitization and over-sensitization by a broken society. Ichi is in love with a local prostitute, but she belongs to the Yazuka boss, who beats her, rapes her.. so Ichi kills the head Yazuka boss for the girl he loves, but he accidentally kills her too. He has never quite gotten over his childhood best friend who was raped in front of him, and he was too afraid to help her.The story is very graphic and very dark, but has a very interesting message, and the directing,music, and acting are all surprisingly so good, that they actually get the message across flawlessly even though you might have to turn the movie off every 20 minutes just to catch your breath!So, Kakihara teaches his new girlfriend on the humane treatment of masochists, and when he tells her to come at him as if to kill him - she although worn out after beating on him for so long, takes fist to his face one more time... and he simply says - ""That's enough, you're not the one,"" and walks away. Talk about a different first (and last) date.Kakihara is cold, calculating, fearless, and crazy. A sado masochist with delusions of grandeur and a love so misguided it's more of a deathwish then anything else. Ichi is emotionally stunted, psychotic, and sad, garbed in a black superhero costume, or uniform of some type, and out for revenge.. Together, they make one hell of a pair in ICHI THE KILLER. I have not seen a lot of Asian extreme films, they're honestly a bit much for me - Ichi had a very charismatic cast which compels you to watch through to the end.",positive
"You know those revenge stories that are so often used in various Asian cinema, the ones that involve, like, Jackie Chan killing the killers of his brother or whatever? This film is NOTHING like that. However, that's as close of a basic foundational structure I can give you to help explain this amazing psychological look into a world defined by violence and masochism.The storyline is much too deep to give a proper synopsis without either making it sound clichéd or giving away too much information, but basically it's a story about an ex-cop who brainwashes a tender, sensitive young man to kill all the ""bullies"" of the world in order to ignite gang violence. It involves a lot of gore and a crazy sadomasochist with a torn-up face who delights in feeling hunted by Ichi. Various characters all struggle to define their loyalties to violence which leads up to this absolutely stunning ending which frankly could never have originated in American cinema.It's also quite visually appealing, both artistically and with gore. It's an amazing film that anyone with a strong stomach should take the time to hunt down and see.--PolarisDiB",positive
"In 2001 Japanesse cult director Takashi Miike created one of the most unique and controversial movies ever to grace the screen. An adaptation of a manga with the same name, ""Ichi The Killer"" is a wild and crazy ride into the depths of human madness. As the movie creates its own parallel to our world where sexual violence and torture are common ways to express a character's emotional condition or thoughts.Plotwise ""Ichi The Killer"" deals with an yakuza Kakihara (played by the diverse Tadanobu Asano) who along with his underlings starts a search for his missing boss. At the same time he finds himself chased by a mysterious assassin known only as Ichi. Kakihara's methods of extracting information become a similar sight throughout the film, with him torturing anyone that could know something about his boss.The movie is presented as a dark comedy that feels more like a parody of humanity's most dark and hidden desires. With every character representing a sick and twisted version of a certain established type of behavior found in modern society. From the abused, passive and sexually inactive male being transformed into a crying psychopatic murderer whose's only excitement comes from seeing (or causing) massive displays of violence and rape (Ichi). To the violent gangster stereotype further villainized with the character of Kakihara whose never ending need to inflict pain to others or to himself has left him void to any other forms of arouse or emotion. Miike goes so far that he criticizes women in Japan for their often seen submissive behavior by introducing a more independent persona with the character of Karen, a notably western influenced person, her need to cause pain nearly borders Kakihara's.The violence itself is presented in such an obscenely over-exaggerated way that one can not help but laugh at some of the situations created by it. Make no mistake this movie is definitely no kiddie ride, and people who can't stand horror or alternative films have no place in watching this. Miike has gone so far in this that even the title introduction in the begging is going to shock you. He also succeeds in creating a very dreamlike feel to the movie. More nightmarish than dreamlike actually. The finale itself is shockingly absurd with the two main characters ""battling"" it out from a third person's perspective.A special note should be made concerning the movie's soundtrack. Whose unique use of completely different and diverse from each other sounds and styles fits with the film's own meddling in cinematic genres.There is really no second like ""Ichi The Killer"" Takashi Miike created an original work that could disgust many but could also amaze any of those people who are searching for something more untraditional.",positive
"Takashi Miike is a committed sadist; he doesn't just play around with gruesome imagery, he immerses himself in it. Depictions of mutilation, decapitation, and just about every other outrage human beings can perpetrate on other people's bodies (and some they can't, at least not in a universe where the laws of physics as we know them are observed) have become common-place in movies and on television - half the TV shows in prime-time feature corpses in various states of dismemberment, decomposition and God knows what - but these endeavors only employ sadism as a hook, drawing in adult audiences with the promise of seeing something freakish and mortifying. These works are not involved with sadism the way Miike's are, do not take the same insane relish in inventing new tortures, new forms of mortification. Looked at in this light, Miike's Ichi the Killer represents some kind of high-water mark; it strives for a level of sadistic glee above what even most Japanese shockers do (and there are some shockers out there), and achieves what amounts to masterpiece status. Of course the word ""masterpiece"" is employed in strictly relative terms here; Ichi the Killer is not my idea of a masterpiece in the true sense, is not even my idea of what makes for good viewing, but one must acknowledge what Miike has created - nothing more or less than a classic in the field of shock cinema.It's inevitable that such a film would be based on a manga (that's a Japanese comic book for those of you not up on dork-culture (anyone reading this review who feels the need to fill me in on the history of manga, by way of explaining to me how they are not simply ""comic books,"" need not bother, for I do not care)), which are apparently viewed as inspiration treasure-troves among those fascinated by nihilism, flesh-mortification, misogyny and the eternally mysterious, ritual-happy world of the Yakuza. Ichi the Killer gives us all of the above in spades. Its title character is a kind of demented anti-super-hero, a dopey, quivering, brainwashed wreck of a kid bent on ridding the world of all bullies, who dresses up in a nutty Darth-Vader-type outfit (sans mask) equipped with retractable blades that spring out when he performs his martial arts maneuvers, neatly slicing and dicing anyone who gets in the way (Ichi is rather indiscriminate about who he kills; we're led to believe that he has been programmed by his vengeful handler to murder only bad guys, but apparently the programming is a bit dodgy). A regular movie would show Ichi lopping people's heads off, severing the occasional jugular, but Miike is not content with such pedestrian amusements, and pushes things to such outrageous levels that our only sane reaction is to laugh. Miike fills whole rooms with dismembered bodies, spilled guts, blood, decapitated heads, achieving a level of carnage so over-the-top that it becomes surrealist comedy, Ichi a figure not of pity or menace but high sadistic hilarity, a murderous, brainwashed Jerry Lewis. As funny as Ichi is, however, he is not the funniest character in the movie; that distinction belongs to Kakihara, a Yakuza whose favorite pastimes are, in order, inflicting pain on other people, and inflicting pain on himself. Kakihara is a bod-mod freak; his face is covered with strategic scars, his body adorned with tattoos, but his most outrageous mods are the slashes in his cheeks, through which he exhales puffs of cigarette smoke, and which allow him to perform feats of mastication unheard of in human history. The acts of mutilation carried out by people on others in Ichi the Killer are scarcely more outrageous than those carried out by Kakihara upon himself; he feels compelled at one point to slice the end of his own tongue off (the ring through the end of it makes a nice handle to hold while doing the slicing; clever boy, that Kakihara).If this all sounds like too much - well, it is, and that's kind of the point. Miike, like many of his brethren in Asian film, is obsessed with shock-effects, with pushing outrage to a level heretofore unseen in cinema, and by virtue of films like Ichi the Killer has become the godfather of the form. Sure, there are moments of Ichi the Killer where Miike wants us to be touched - he shows Ichi being nice to a little kid, encouraging us to see Ichi as some poor fool with a kindly heart whose brain has been led astray by evil forces - but Miike is only really serious about visualizing torture, mutilation and extreme bod-mod activities as bloodily as possible. Ichi the Killer is a compendium of outrage, and it succeeds only as long as it's delivering on its promise of ever-more-brutal tortures, ever-more-insane forms of self-inflicted harm. It is, of course, a reprehensible movie filled with simulated acts of violence so sick as to make even battle-hardened extreme-cinema fans squirm in their seats, but it's done with so much humor, so much gleeful flair, that you can't help being taken in by it. Its attitude toward existence is purely nihilistic, but damned if it doesn't have fun exposing the essential cruelty of life, the animal nature of human beings. Miike is one sick puppy, but he seems aware of how sick he is, and doesn't try to dress up his outrages with a lot of pretty visual effects or Hollywood-style gloss. Miike is something of a minimalist when it comes to the camera; he tends just to point it and shoot, punctuating the action with stylistic flourishes rather than drowning his movies in style. It isn't even cinema itself that Miike seems primarily interested in, it's the chance to realize his twisted fantasies. He gets away with it because, unlike a lot of would-be sadists, he owns his fantasies, and seems to acknowledge his own twistedness.",negative
"Ichi (Nao Omori) is a disturbed and brainwashed killing machine who dresses up in a superhero costume and is controlled by his mentor named Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto).Kakihara (Asano Tadanobu) is a sadistic gangster who loves three things: giving and being given pain and looking for the killing machine named Ichi, the person who killed his boss and ran away with his three-hundred million yen. His quest with looking for the mysterious Ichi causes the streets to become a battleground with the gangs of Shinjuku. As the film goes by, the battle with the gangs of Shinjuku becomes more gory than ever.ICHI THE KILLER is a rare film that we get these days. It contains good cartoon like violence, humour so black yet it would make people laugh, an awesome soundtrack and great makeup effects. Sure, it may not be for everyone but for those that are open-minded or are Miike fans and want to watch something different, this film would be for them.",positive
"Be warned - as early as the film's titles - letters rising from fallen sperm - (The costumed killer ejaculated voyeuristically watching violence done by one of the other team of gangster killers).  You should either run screaming from the theater or stay for an over-the-top exercise in so much violence it becomes white noise and almost disappears.  Seen at the Cinematheque, here in Los Angeles, with an adult crowd - this unrated but surely X-cubed film was a delight to those who stayed  A few patrons fled in the middle of the screening but most got the point.  Bad guys pursuing bad guys - with genre formula being trashed at every point - the humor built and built.  Any good characters (children included) were decimated or tortured.  None were spared.  Yet the film is a romp - from the complaining co-workers who grumble about having to clean up blood-drenched murder scenes (they found intestines everywhere) to the sado-masochistic special effects.  The film has left turns into fantasy - then back again - it has intentional bad-acting scenes (from previously capable actors)- the camera work has a will of it sown - exposition that makes no sense.This film posits the questions: If you are going to be a bad-boy film director and take screen violence as far as it can go - no farther than that - NO REALLY FARTHER THAN THAT - to the point of blood almost every minute - what would the result be?  Apparently the director feels that on the far side of excess violence and blood letting in glorious technicolor and grotesque special effects, the cinema would revert to a twisted sense of innocence (beyond all that killing there is a comic sense of the universe).A film that should be seen - but you should be prepared for it.  Not a classic - but a definite statement - more a cinema-artist's statement than a traditional film.  Museums will find a place for it - families will abhor it.I got into it to my amazement.  It stretched my mind about what should be so.",positive
"What can one say about Ichi the Killer? I do have to say, without a doubt, it is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. I was afraid going in, after hearing all of the hype, that it would be gore just for the sake of gore. But the way it is portrayed and the characters are what really drive the movie and make it stand out from other gorefests. It may be my sick personality, but I found myself laughing a lot throughout the movie. There is a lot of black humor in the film, which I enjoy. I would not consider this a horror movie by any means though, as I was not scared at all while watching it and it had none of the tendencies of a traditional horror film. The only thing that kept me from giving it 10 stars is the ending, which is a bit abstract, but I'm sure it was intended that way. But I would recommend this film to anyone, cause it's something everyone should experience. The only movie I could compare this to would be Dead Alive, and that is a very loose comparison. Just do yourself a favor and watch it.",positive
"To be honest, I don't know what to think of this film. Personally, I couldn't think about it in a critical way like I do with most films purely because of the extreme levels of on screen violence. Essentially, the violence is the protagonist of this film and anyone who thinks otherwise is sorely mistaken. How can anyone know what the hell is going on when every five minutes or so there's another scene of extreme brutality? Being a hardened gore fan, I thought I'd seen the worst there can possibly be in terms of on screen violence (Hell even Saw pushed me) but this film dared to take it one step further. Mere minutes into the film, we are greeted with the grisly aftermath of an extremely brutal murder (blood covers literally every surface and innards are strewn around like confetti), and, for the first hour at least, the violence doesn't let up.What follows is the most brutal portrayal of on screen violence that I have ever seen. Tongues are severed off, boiling fat is poured over people (with close ups of skin melting and such) and even a child is decapitated. The boundaries of what can be shown on screen are pushed to the very limits and even die-hard gore fans will feel sick to the stomach as the violence continues scene after scene after scene.I believe that, in order to take a critical approach to this film, I will have to watch it again. The audience is so engrossed (or repulsed?) by the carnage that they see or take in very little else. On a second viewing, I may be able admire the film, as the violence is necessary to the story, but it is the carnage that will be remembered. A case of style over content maybe? What can I say? Personally, with repeated viewings, this film may turn out to be masterpiece in the guise of a Japanese gore fest but until those viewing (and they won't be anytime soon), a Japanese gore fest is what it'll remain to be.3/5",positive
"What My title for this comment says should be a warning to some. That is why the viewer should probably be strongly warned of what this film has in it. Extreme Comic Book Violence. Before I watched this film, I knew that it would have a lot of violence, but I wasn't expecting it to reach heights greater than what I thought. I didn't think it was going to be as extreme as it is before I watched it. The film did shock me a bit.If you think films like Dead Alive, Battle Royale, Audition, Salo', and Caligula are as depraved as movies can be, be prepared to be disarmed. With that said, I will now talk about the film. The story is this. Kakihara is a bisexual sadist who enjoys doing sadistic things such as hanging people by hooks and dumping hot grease on them or pulling the flesh off of people's face's with his arms and legs. He is looking for his Yakuza boss who disappeared. Kakihara is sad because his boss used to play crazy and weird sexual games with him. Kakahara is sort of unaware of a boy named Ichi who runs around in a superhero outfit the the number 1 on it and has blades in his boots that he uses to kill evil people with in gory unrealistic fashions. Ichi is being summoned by a supposedly retired cop. From there on, the story of madness, rape, murder, and mayhem gets a little more complicated. This film, when you look past all the gallons of blood and the sadomasochism, is brilliant. It is full of humor and entertainment but that is not what makes it good. I admired it's story and it's completely risky way to tell what the adventure of all these corrupt people. The film is unafraid of shocking it's viewers or going a little bit over the top to show who the characters are. The film's style is that of a MANGA. It is very fast paced and quick in going on with the scenes. there is one scene in particular where a woman's fingers are snapped. This scene is more shocking then it sounds due to the fact that you don't realize it until it is made obvious. once it becomes obvious enough it jumps away from that scene. Not everyone will agree with me that this film is as good as it is. There are many people that see it just as a gross shocker with no purpose other then grossing us out. There is a purpose in this film though. Even if the meaning is harder then ever to decipher. But I like films that have a hard message to figure out. It makes me want to watch them more. I find this film to be a true Japanese classic that should be remembered by the few people that see it. Words cannot describe how much I love this film. ICHI THE KILLER is a true masterpiece that has a good plot, a good meaning, and a good, yet shocking, ending twist that will haunt you for days. Watch out for the gratuitous adult content though.",negative
"Ichi the Killer is a landmark picture in Japanese Cinema. It is an audio and visual attack on the senses (and gag reflex) which adopts a unique style of movie/comic book- hybrid film making. A real Miike masterpiece! Kakihara is not your typical Yakuza gangster. He is sadistic, masochistic, depraved, has a hair trigger for violence, and is really really upset that someone has kidnapped his boss, Anjo and taken off with 100 million yen. So, torturing his way through the underworld, he manages to get kicked out of the Yakuza and finds out, too late, that it was a man called Ichi that killed his boss and is now after him. Kakihara then sets out for revenge and vindication in the name of Anjo.Ichi, on the other hand, seems to be a more simple kind of guy who works for an ex-cop who loves to wreak havoc on the Yakuza. Ichi's work is thought to be that of a brutally insane and blood thirsty maniac. But, upon meeting him, one can't help but notice his peculiar innocence and naiveté. However, it is this very feature that makes him so deadly.When these two forces collide, it's endless violence, torture, rape, murder, blood, gore, and underworld danger and depravity. Ichi the Killer is a movie that directors like Quentin Tarantino only dream of making. If films were people, his Kill Bills would only watch and drool at Ichi the Killer!",positive
"Ichi the Killer is an experience that makes more sense (in a sick and twisted way) after each viewing.  Upon first seeing this, my spine cringed during Suzuki's ""hanging out"" scene and was pretty much dumbfounded by how intense, powerfully violent, yet addictingly hard-to-turn-away-from story all about a vicious killer and tears of pain. See this in a movie theater and see how many groans, moans, and people heading to the exits you can find.  To those who stay till the end, you won't be disappointed.Miike's portrayal of the characters is awesome.  In the seedy yakuza underworld, there is no good or bad....just victims.  Despite the film's namesake, Tadanobu Asano is fascinatingly over the top as Kakihara.  He is the ultimate psycho who really REALLY enjoys his work.  After seeing this a couple of times, Asano really had me laughing sometimes by his acting, delivery, and that wicked cheeky grin!  I also loved his demeanor; whether happy, frightened, or enraged, Asano's constant mood really compliments the character of Kakihara...he just never loses his cool.  He EVEN smokes with cool style!!There are so many themes throughout the movie like manipulation, innocence lost, traumatic flashbacks, S&M, brutality, that Miike's pacing of the film gives you time to regain your sanity.  Tsukumato as the enigmatic Jijii gives an eerily creepy, yet captivating performance.  Ichi himself is a man so complex that it's really hard understand as you gain a glimpse into the terror of his troubled mind.  Or Karen's misleading smile and her unusual style of dialogue. One thing to focus on is what motivates each character and how this affects the actions they take throughout the film.Unlike any film, Ichi the Killer should be seen to be believed.  If not showing in theater, try to get the uncut Dutch version to experience Ichi in all its glory.  Plus, the cast and crew looked like they really had a blast doing this.  C'MON, who wouldn't want to work with Takashi Miike?",positive
"Japan's Takashi Miike is a fan-favorite of American filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I first came by Miike on the ""Masters of Horror"" TV show when he directed the segment called ""Imprint."" Last year, I came across Miike's infamous horror film ""Audition,"" which is now considered one of my favorite and most shocking flicks in the genre.Now I had the opportunity yesterday to watch 2001's ""Ichi the Killer"" with a friend.Needless to a say, our opinions on the film were very different. He hated it. I really, really liked it. I saw it as something different from most crime thrillers. It had elements of horror, the crime thriller, and even some black comedy. I thought it was really cool. He saw it as basically two hours of non-stop torture, violence, rape, murder, and just overall insanity. Based on the Japanese Manga (comic book) by Hideo Yamamoto and set in Tokyo, Japan's, Shinjuku district, the plot concerns the search for the kidnapped boss of the Anjo Gang (who also disappeared with 300 million yen), which is apparently the most feared yakuza (Japanese mafia) gang in all of Tokyo. The body count rises steadily when the boss's chief henchman, the disfigured, pain-loving sadist Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), assigns himself the task of locating the Anjo Gang's beloved leader at any and all costs.Kakihara is in no way a hero or anti-hero. This guy is a bad-a** gangster to the highest degree. He's also a pain junkie: He loves torturing people and actually gets off from watching other people in varying states of pain & suffering, from inflicting pain & suffering upon others, and also having pain & suffering inflicted upon himself by others. He's the true definition of a movie psychopath (he may even make Hannibal Lecter blush with envy). Upon being tipped off on the location of a possible culprit, Kakihara strings up the poor fellow by inserting hooks into his back and pouring hot grease all over his body; Kakihara loves every minute of this particularly nasty torture session.Kakihara's search for answers in the kidnapping of his boss is set against the backdrop of the psychopathic vigilante/serial killer known only as Ichi (Nao Omori), a mentally disturbed, sexually repressed young man who is the pawn of an equally disturbed third individual who is using Ichi to systematically wipe out the yakuza members. Needless to say that when Ichi goes into one of his murderous frenzies, you just better have a barf bag ready.Obviously, ""Ichi the Killer"" is not a movie for all tastes. I learned that when I watched this movie with my friend and our vastly different responses to it. ""Ichi the Killer"" is an even more sadistic film than Miike's previous ""Audition."" But while the violence and depravity in ""Audition"" was genuinely shocking and horrifying, the violence and depravity in ""Ichi the Killer"" ceases being shocking and horrifying after about the second bloodbath and slowly becomes hilarious - just think about how people walk around with gashes in their throats bleeding all over the place before finally succumbing to the blood loss or when Ichi is able to cut a man in half with the blades in his boots.I'm sure I'm probably wrong about this, but I think I got this film's ""message"" about the evil that human beings are capable of inflicting upon each other and the almost-sexual gratification that people can sometimes get from it. When Ichi rescues a prostitute from her physically abusive pimp, she confesses that she loves being beaten up and that he will gladly give her what she desires. Kakihara and his ""methods"" of getting information on the whereabouts of his missing boss are also worthy of exhibiting this pain-loving stuff.""Ichi the Killer"" is not a perfect film, though. The plot tends to drag along somewhere in the third act and can try the patience of some viewers. This was probably one of the few things me and my friend agreed on when we watched it, that there were some things that we felt were unnecessary, regardless of how chaotic the movie was aiming to be. The over-the-top violence and sadism has made ""Ichi the Killer"" a cult film amongst the aficionados in Japan and across the world. This is not a film for all tastes and I would definitely not recommend it to those who don't have strong stomachs for senseless violence and depravity. But for a movie with senseless violence and depravity and those who have stomachs for it, look no further than ""Ichi the Killer.""8/10",positive
"This has to be one of my greatest experiences in the Asian cinema. I have been watching Asian movies since the eighties where I saw my first martial arts movies and I have been an Asian fan ever since. They have a unique way of making movies and a boldness you don't see in western cinema. I have a few friends that share my sick fascination in the gory and shocking side of Asian movie making and Ichi the killer is the best in it's genre. I have seen a lot of Miike's movies which I won't mention here but Ichi is by far my favorite Miike movie.Takashi Miike spits out movies faster than speeding bullets and some of his works are not even worth watching. But once in a while he hits the spot and delivers a masterpiece and Ichi is by all means a masterpiece. A lot of people only see the blood, torture, gore and humiliation of the human body in Miike's movies but mostly he has a hidden or at least partly foggy agenda. Ichi is basically a film about a loyal yakusa henchman trying to find meaning in his life after his boss has been murdered and a murderer trying to find himself in a labyrinth of deception and lost memories. It is well played and very well made.Tadanobu Asano excels as Kakihara and Nao Omori is extremely good as the violent insane killer Ichi. The special effects has a realistic feel about them and you can almost feel the pain inflicted in this movie and there is plenty of pain to go around. Ichi is not a film for people with weak nerves or a dislike for blood. Miike likes to shock his audience and is a master in this field. He delivers the meat for the gore hounds and has a weird sense of humor....I give this little blood feast a 8.0",positive
"I wish somebody would clone Takashi Miike. This man churns out gory masterpieces with speed and consistency not seen since the 1970s giallo boom. Ichi The Killer is the movie that brought Miike to international attention and it still holds up as one of the filthiest exercises in film-making that I have had the pleasure to watch.Quentin Tarantino has earned millions ripping off Asian genre classics, so it makes a nice change to see an Asian director take some inspiration from him. Ichi The Killer has clearly been influenced by ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" in both content and construction. However, Miike takes things to a new level both stylistically and through his mind blowing use of violence. This is one of those films that has to be seen in its uncut form, preferably without the hideous cockney dubbing.The film follows Kakihara, a Yakuza assassin, on his mission to avenge his boss' murder. After a few false turns, Kakihara learns that Ichi was responsible for the killing and faced with the extent of Ichi's butchery, comes to believe that he may just have met his match in the sadism stakes. Miike expertly weaves several subplots into the film, all of which have the common element of being bloody. As captivating as the story is, it is the breathtaking violence that sets this film apart. Miike splashes blood like an artist uses paint. One of the most striking examples is Suzuki's torture, which sees him suspended on hooks, pierced with skewers and covered with boiling oil. Luckily for gorehounds, Miike is just warming up. This film contains enough blood and severed limbs for two horror movies.Miike directs the film with his usual sense of style and flair. His affinity for all things surreal is given expression in Kakihara's fist swallowing scene and Jijii's pre-murder bodybuilding poses. The film also has a healthy dose of black humour, largely thanks to Kakihara's masochism. The actors are uniformly excellent, with Tadanobu Asano particularly brilliant as Kakihara. The only significant fault with the movie is the character of Ichi himself, who seems under-developed in comparison to his more interesting Nemesis Kakihara. There is also a slight lull in the film when it explores the ex-policeman's relationship with his son. However, these are small complaints and do little to detract from the film's many great qualities.Ichi The Killer is subversive film-making at its best. Takashi Miike has carved himself a unique place in world cinema. The astonishing thing is that he keeps on coming up with the goods, time and time again.",negative
"Be warned, for this movie is as graphic as it gets. Murder, dismemberment, torture, rape, mutilation... and that's just the beginning. This tour-de-force of sadism as directed by Japanese auteur Takashi Miike is an unbelievable display of cruel and inhumane punishment, both to the characters inhabiting the film and anyone with a weak stomach. Anyone familiar with Miike's other films, especially ""Audition"" will find this to be familiar, yet still interesting ground. The violence is so over the top that it's hard not to laugh while watching it. How many times have you seen someone get their throat cut, only to have a literal torrent of blood spray out of the wound all over everything? How about a guy who cuts off the tip of his tongue as an apology to his bosses, rather than the traditional tip of the finger? How about a guy who gets cut in half lengthwise by a concealed boot blade, only to split in half and fall to the floor in two? One of the main reasons to watch this film is for Kakihara, the character played by Tadanobu Asano. A bleached blond sadomasochist, this guy easily ranks up there with any other anti-hero you can think of. Think of him as a garishly dressed metro sexual with a penchant for needles and you'll come close to what he looks and acts like.Describing the story isn't quite so simple but multiple viewings provide more insight each time into the labyrinthine plot. Kakihara is a Yakuza lieutenant on the hunt for his missing boss, who had disappeared with 300 million yen. His reasoning for finding him has nothing to do with the money but because of the fact that his boss was the one person who knew how to dish out pain the way he liked. Soon, Kakihara discovers that his boss has been murdered and begins the search for the man who butchered his boss. He discovers that the man responsible is an enigmatic figure named Ichi, a wild tornado of violence who holds the promise of giving Kakihara what he so desires: the ultimate experience in painful death.Sounds messed up? Well, let me assure you, that it is. And I haven't even begun to describe Kakihara's methods in finding Boss Anjo. If at this point, I've gotten your interests piqued, I'll leave it for you to experience.It's a yakuza movie of sorts but it really plays out as a kind of rhetoric on desire and our willingness to fulfill them or have them fulfilled. The film can also be viewed as just a straight up gore fest and it works on that level also. There is great use of physical and computer assisted effects. Also, the music by Karera Musication deserves mention as probably the most original film score I've ever heard in any movie, period.If you want to see something daring, disturbing and groundbreaking, I strongly recommend this film for those that can handle the intense scenes of violence. Just make sure you find the unrated director's cut for the film and avoid it on cable, which shows the R-rated version. See it the way it was meant to be seen, as with every other film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",positive
"I was originally a little leery about seeing this movie (even though I'm pretty Boss and can usually take stuff like this)...I heard it was actually pretty hard to watch. So like 10 minutes ago, I finally finished it and felt like a pansy for thinking I couldn't. Don't let people come up telling you ""OMG it's so horrible and blah blah blah."" Um, no, it's awesome. I'm a HUGE fan of cool splatter-gore, crazy, freak you out movies and this one has it all...including a whole load of torture by the COOLest bad guy everrrr Tadanobu Asano (Kakihara) and his 2 foot needles. He looks like a pierced up rockstar who you want to get to know, but stay away from at the same time.Best Lines: 1. Kakihara: ""There's no love in your violence."" 2. Kakihara: ""Damn... Nobody left to kill me."" 3. Kakihara: ""Put some feeling into it, already! If you're going to give someone pain, you've got to get into it!"" 4. Jiro: ""Is it possible to rip someone's arm off with your bare hands?""Other Super Cool Things: The acting by Tadanobu Asano (Kakihara) and Nao Ohmori (Ichi) is so right on point. There's never really a dull moment in the entire movie, which is kind of a mix of horror and comedy. But the real reason why this movie is so good, is because of how it makes you feel sad for these killers/heroes the whole time...especially Ichi who seems at one minute, completely mental, and the next, completely sweet and innocent. Not to mention the gore is pretty cool and the torture scenes are pretty cool also (especially what they do to the character Suzuki who really gets it) Some other stand out characters are the twins who will make you LOL toward the middle of the movie and Takeshi (Kaneko's son) who winds up having a big part.My Only Problem: They introduce most of the characters to you all at once so if you aren't realllly paying attention to the names, you might get a little lost toward the middle.Best Scenes (Without Spoilers): 1. The very beginning when Kakihara turns around and you get to see his face for the first time...he's smoking...it's awesome. 2. The Suzuki torture scene and the torture scene with the...arm (as quoted above)...haha 3. When Ichi goes to the hotel (we see his work for the first time) and he speaks to the beaten lady from the club. 4. When you find out why Ichi kills people. 5. The new Anjo gang with leader Kakihara is shown walking down the street in slo-mo. 6. The entire ending scene on the roof. 7. When Jijii takes his shirt off towards the end...you will never see it coming...Overall: It's not for everyone, but I will put it on my list of super cool foreign movies. This one has heart to it (and tons of gore) so if your up for it, do yourself a favor and sit through the 2 hours of great cinematography and splatter-gore/torture/love story/bullying story/horror/comedy. Then tell me what you made of the amazingly (left-open) ending.9/10 Stars. Check out all my reviews at http://dianalynn5287.blogspot.com/",positive
"This infamous film from Takashi Miike is set in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo and is centred on two very violent characters. There is the eponymous Ichi, a troubled individual who kills those he is told are like the people who bullied him at school. One of those he kills is yakuza boss Anjo; the crime scene is cleaned up and his superiors believe he fled with their money. His enforcer is Kakihara, our second protagonist, and he is determined to discover what happened to Anjo... to this end he brutally tortures anybody he suspects might know. This leads to considerably more violence before Ichi and Kakihara finally face each other.If violence on screen bothers you then this certainly isn't the film for you; even if you aren't usually bothered by it there will probably be material that shocks you here... to give a few examples: a man has boiling cooking oil poured on him while he is suspended from hooks; a man cuts off the tip of his tongue; wounds spray blood and a man is sliced in half... actually the last of these is the least offensive as it didn't look as real as some of the other events. Thankfully it isn't just disgusting violence; the main characters are interesting if a little strange. Kakihara is a masochist when he isn't torturing people and Ichi is a sadist even though he constantly says he doesn't like killing people. As well as these too there is an ex-cop yakuza whose son is bullied and a woman, who for no apparent reason, switches to speaking perfect English half of the time. The cast does a fine job making their extreme characters believable; this serves to make the film more disturbing. Given the material it is a bit of a surprise that it manages to be quite funny at times... sometimes it even manages to be funny and disturbing at the same time. This film certainly won't be for everybody; in fact I suspect it would offend the majority of people; but if you can take it then it is well worth watching; it is certainly a must for fans of Takashi Miike's work.These comments are based on watching the cut UK DVD of the film which omits about three minutes of sexual violence... to be honest there was enough disturbing material without needing that as well!",positive
"One of the most notorious films of recent years, this piece of Japanese insanity is from the man who brought us AUDITION, Takashi Miike. But while AUDITION was a slow-paced psychological thriller with an unforgettable climax, from the very start ICHI THE KILLER makes for disturbing viewing. This is violence at its nastiest and most sadistic; the characters have little or no redeeming qualities and only the strongest of stomachs are advised to watch. The BBFC cut out close to five minutes of sexual violence for this film's UK release and for once, I'm glad; violence against men is one thing, but this kind of stuff against women? No thanks.Anyway, the film is very well made indeed, that's undeniable. Miike's camera-work is kinetic and fluid, investing the whole film with a kind of jumpy drug-fuelled excitement. The acting is also of a high calibre, particularly Tadanobu Asano's torturer, Kakihara. It's his film more than it is Ichi's, and he really shines. That's not to say the other actors aren't also very good in all of their different roles, because they are.Of course, this film is slimly plotted and for the most part it's a series of violent scenes, ranging from torture (with hooks and boiling water) to people mutilating themselves, massacres, and much, much more. I enjoyed the way the various plot threads come together as the story progresses, and there's a weird climax that'll leave you scratching your head wondering what just happened. The black humour, spread liberally throughout, also makes things that bit easier to bear. ICHI THE KILLER is a unique and highly original film, a piece of violent art, and horror fans will no doubt enjoy the on-screen carnage. Me, I liked it, but it's not something I think I could sit through a second time.",negative
"Takashi Miike has taken an already gory and upsetting manga series of the same name by Hideo Yamamoto and turned it into one of the most notorious gory Japanese films ever made. The story goes that a mob boss has been literally torn apart by a mysterious killer. One of his enforcers, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), sets out to find his killer, but given that Kakihara is about as sane as a cuckoo clock factory, and a sadomasochist to boot, things inevitable don't work out nice and neatly.Ichi the Killer was banned in many countries upon its initial release, and I can definitely see why. It's absolutely brutal in a way that steps way outside the realm of good taste. There's guts flying every which way, not to mention blood being pumped around is if from a high-pressure water hose. There's also masturbation, prostitution, drugs, criminal acts of all varieties, et cetera, et cetera. Pretty much all the main characters are mentally ill, one way or another, and the film truly feels like a direct to film manga adaptation in a way few films do. There are multiple scenes, which I could see happening in a manga, but which really should have been cut from the film version.But then again, such honesty to one's source material is almost to be admired. As are the huge brass ones required to even direct a film such as this. Because it is a great experience if you're into gore. Not only for the imagery, but for the fact that the story itself works in the confines of the film. Which is a huge plus for a gorefest such as this one.Ichi the Killer is an acquired taste, but if it is to your liking, then it's definitely worth checking out.",positive
"If you've heard of ""Ichi the Killer"" then you've heard about it. Before watching it, I was told that it will be, `absolutely the most violent, grotesque film you have ever seen.' It was for this reason, sick I guess you could say, that I was compelled to know more.What few reviews I was able to find did nothing to give me more insight. Ok, it's gross.ok it's violent.ok, I watched the trailer.but how bad could it be? I looked all over to try and find it, but this won't be at your local video store, for obvious reasons. So, I broke down and purchased it online. I don't know if it's available stateside, but I found mine overseas, the `uncut version;' which is kind of strange to say considering the graphic nature of the movie.The movie has English subtitles, which are distracting and hard to keep up with at times. Too many lines too quickly, I found myself rewinding frequently to catch the dialog. This certainly has a plot, and you find yourself wanting to understand it. Some of the subtitles are misinterpreted and on occasion do not make sense, but that is typical and infrequent enough to deal with.I won't give you any spoilers on the plot, violence or gore.but I will say this, it is because of the plot that the violence, rape and gore are, to say the least, striking. Perhaps the rape and extreme violence to women is the hardest to view. To watch a `slasher' movie in the States is nothing, we find it mindless and many times comical. However this movie is certainly a big step above. The other person who reviewed this movie referred to it as a, `hysterical comedy' but for me it was a barrage on the senses. He may refer to it as such because he has seen others of comparison and hence desensitized; not unlike many Americans are to the aforementioned `slasher' movies. Although there are places where comedy is inserted, for me it was lost as I attempted to swallow the violence, gore or rape that had just preceded it.I would say this movie would be like seeing `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' if it had been viewed in the 1940's. Imagine seeing TCM in 1974 when it came out, it was messed up to most people who saw it THEN, much less how it would be perceived 20 or 30 years earlier.no matter how hokey it might seem now. Actually, to combine a couple of movies, I would say that if you took the violence and gore of TCM and mixed it with the violence and plot of `A Clockwork Orange' and put it out in the 40's or 50's, you would get the same reaction that I got, in present desensitized 2004, to Ichi. If you are sensitive to violence, rape or gore, stay far away.Takashi Miike is Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick, Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino wrapped into one. This movie would never be made in present day USA, but I could see the likes of it in the years to come as directors or Hollywood push the envelope in an effort to be ""trailblazing"" or cutting edge. It's scary to take a peek what will essentially be our slasher films in 20 years, if not sooner.Someone may say I am silly for such comparisons, but I would ask, could you have made TCM or Clockwork in the 1940's? Could you have made Natural Born Killers in the 1950's? Kill Bill in the 1960's? None of these movies, when I saw them, shocked me.Ichi did.",negative
"In recent years the genre of the horror movie (and especially the Japanese horror movies), has become more and more popular and ""Koroshiya 1"" or ""Ichi The Killer"" as it is called in English, is seen as a modern classic in this genre. Personally I can enjoy a good horror movie, but I'm not a fan of gore. I expected to see a good horror movie, but in the end I was very disappointed by it.The story is interesting and original. Ichi is a young, shy man controlled by a member of the Japanese Maffia, the Yakuza, who has suffered from a very traumatic experience in his youth. He has seen how his best friend got raped and he was too scared to help her. He never got over it and now he's psychotic and sad and becomes very violent when he sees something bad happening. His opponent is Kakihara. He's a member of the Yakuza, but is expelled because his methods are too violent, even for them. He's a cold and fearless man and he can stand the most horrible pains. He lives his life only to experience even more pain than he has ever experienced before. He's a sado-masochist who has only one wish left: to find the one who is worthy of killing him in the most horrible way possible.I guess there are many fans of gory flicks who will absolutely love this movie. They won't be disappointed by it: People being sliced in half, a man being hanged on flesh hooks that have been pierced through the skin of his back, a person's face sliding of the wall after it has been sliced of, a woman's nipples being cut off... you can find it all in this movie... However, personally I didn't like it. I guess you have to be a bit of a sadist yourself to enjoy what is portrayed in this movie and to sit through the 129 minutes in one time. I admit that the story was good and original and that the acting was OK, but the extremely graphic violence was just too much for me. I've always had an open mind towards movies, but too much is too much. That's why I give this movie only a 3/10.",negative
"Takashi Miike, currently the world's best, most innovative and prominent director is not one for shying away from taboos or controversy. With the amount of films he makes you may expect them to be little more than B-movie trash. But he continues to defy conventions, pushing the benchmark higher. Audition, Happiness of Katakuris, Visitor Q all prove his endless abilities, and Ichi is no different.Ichi is an awesome assassin. However, he has his own problems, haunted by a violent past which continually torments him. He does not want to kill, but it is all he can do. He tries to love, but it always seems to end in brutal, bloody death. When a Yakuza boss disappears with lots of money, his men search, creating havoc, killing many and unsettling other bosses. The sadistic and masochistic Kakihara leads them, looking for someone who can give him what he wants-extreme torture. he cuts off part of his tongue, and frequently chops at himself for amusement and to disgust others. Both characters are brilliant, and extremely well acted. They soon run into each other, and kakihara tries to make Ichi give him the pain he desires, while Ichi struggles to work out what is real and what has made fabricated in order to make him what he is. Many are killed in a very gory fashion, and eventually the two fight on top of a building.This is a breathtakingly violent film, sometimes hard to watch, particularly the rape scenes, and it is gritty enough that we twitch in our seats each time someone is hurt. However, it is also very funny, Miike transcending genres as always, and the plot is very complex at times, though strangely basic in the end. Good acting, cool sets and costumes, excellent effects all make it good to watch, but if you do not like blood or having to work when watching a film, it may be best to avoid this one. Everyone else partake of its bloody goodness, as it is not entirely shocking, but will definitely stay with us.8 out of 10",positive
"I really, really didn't know what to make of Ichi the Killer the first time I saw it, however late it was at night on cable (i.e. very after hours, almost up till dawn), and after seeing it a second time I'm still not sure. If it isn't one of the more overwhelmingly violent films ever made, it's at least that from Japan, where there's a whole film movement devoted to these ultra-violent (likely deliberately so based on the subject matter) tales of the dark side, like if David Lynch watched a boat-load of anime and was told to do a feature. In fact, this is what the very prolific filmmaker Takashi Miike has done here, and it took me a little while to figure that out. Obviously, through the use of different kinds of medium with the camera- there's never one set style, a lot of hand-held camera movements, digital, shaky, with editing going at a whiplash style or in longer takes- this is perhaps the point. Maybe what threw me heavily off-guard was that the film was based on an Magma anime-style comic book, which is possibly where the scenes and shots of extreme stylized over-the-top and often shocking violent acts had its footing in (which is kind of redundant to say as there isn't one non-shocking scene here).But that being said, it's more what is being dealt with in the story and specifically with the characters that had a friend I was watching with say at least a few times ""this is a ****ed up film man, damn"", and he wasn't without footing. We have here masochism deluxe in torture, sex, self-mutilation, etc, sex, rape, bizarre mind-control, and often done to a confusing pitch for those not ready for characters that sometimes seem to pop in and out or new ones out of nowhere (Japanese audiences wont be thrown off possibly, but others may be wary of this). The premise has Kakihara (Nadanobu Asano, with two faces as an actor that work perfectly), one of the more ruthless gangsters ever put to film, out for vengeance after a boss is killed. The one who's doing this and other killings is Ichi (Nao Omori), who has a traumatic memory of being helpless during a teenage rape that messes him to the point of doing these acts against his better judgment. Mind-control, of course, is at work here, leading the gangster and the screwed-up innocent (who happens to feel sexual masochism as Kakihara does in his own way) to a shattering, ambiguous climax.A holier-than-thou moralist might look at this film- if one could stand through the whole thing without either being utterly sickened or just getting perplexed at the un-conventional story- and wonder how this can even exist. One might even look at how morbid the underbelly culture of Japanese entertainment might be for this. Obviously it is a morbid, surreal, and for a cult-audience picture; this could never attract the masses who saw the Kill Bill films (then again, just the opening title wouldn't get past the censors!), and then again perhaps it shouldn't. In ways that really only became a little clearer on a second viewing, Miike is dealing with such depraved, unsympathetic characters (even Ichi, who despite being an innocent in a way by route of his 'master', is like the anti-hero of Oldboy) to not only push the boundaries of what he can do as a filmmaker with the mis en scene and music, but our own as well. And one should ask, would this film, with its rooms coated with blood and guts and moments of people getting split in half and, be as disturbing if it was just an anime adaptation of the comic book? By doing it in this over-the top way, I actually found myself laughing at times (perhaps inappropriately, who knows) when these scenes were shown on screen. There almost had to be this very, very dark comic tone to some of the scenes in the film, otherwise it would just be too much to take. Sometimes the gravity does outweigh the laughable moments, and this need in Miike to push the boundaries does become much even for me, who was prepared for anything after hearing the hype (not just too much in the content but in the style, perhaps making the surrealism of the environment into it not being interesting). But somehow Ichi the Killer is a film that works for its crowd and doesn't stop: depraved characters, crime without pity, and enough blood to make Tarantino's toes curl.",positive
"ICHI THE KILLER is Takashi Miike's version of mischievous fun on celluloid. What comes to mind is a scene where two delinquent boys are roasting a beetle with a magnifying glass. The two are giggling and snorting at the expense of the poor insect which is soon to go to insect heaven. Those two boys are Takashi Miike and Tadanobu Asano doing whatever they feel like with a flamboyant film they've entitled ICHI THE KILLER. The movie celebrates the sadistic little kid in all of us.From the first twenty minutes or so, you might think that ICHI THE KILLER is your run-of-the-mill gangster flick. Oh my, that would be awfully boring. It's so much more! Plain wacky would be a good word to describe it. Characters pop in and out with no apparent association to one another. People get tortured and mutilated before we know who they are. Did the lady have a relationship with the gang lord? Who cares, since she makes such a lovely stain on the carpet!Other words to describe the film are squeamish, bloody, and darkly humorous. Right when you think you've caught up with the story, it changes gear like a freak Tonka truck. One minute the lens may focus on a sophisticated crime scene, but the next minute it's catching a teardrop in a bowl of Ramen. While you may not find a single meaning for the whole story, you'll surely come away with a basket full of senseless images.Let's suspend some poor Japanese fool from the ceiling with fishing line and pour boiling hot oil on his head.The sneaky uncle figure takes off his coat to reveal a huge mass of muscles! He is Japan's champion body builder!Open the door, and the wall is covered with blood and guts. Nobody says a word. Oh, did I mention that the guy over there has a twin brother? Oh well, it doesn't matter, since that twin just got killed.And all through the audience you can hear the sound of people scratching their heads in confusion.In closing, I'd like to comment on Ichi himself, the new breed of Japanese superhero. He's a seemingly normal young man who moonlights as a vigilante in a black rubber suit. His special move is a spasmodic razor-blade kick that can chop a person in half. He has anxiety attacks when speaking with other people. He fantasizes about women in twisted fairy tale scenarios.Best of all, he plays Tekken under a blanket for a living. Now that is my kind of superhero! It's only a matter of time before the mushroom cloud breaks forth and Ichi wakes up in his perfectly tragic fantasy world.In this world, his asthmatic gasp spells victory for the human race! It makes no difference -- he dishes out his own cocktail of justice to the evil gang lord or the little kid on the tricycle -- indifferently.JYJimboduck-dot-com",positive
"Old Takashi Miike certainly clings to his garnered reputation as an extreme cinema master. Indeed it seems the only thing that keeps him afloat. Covering up barren characters and inane plot lines with explicit ultra violence seems to be staple procedure in Miike's portfolio.Ichi The Killer is no different, and perhaps enforces that point. Although it is based on a comic book, the film itself adopts a garbled approach to telling its story, using a mishmash montage of nonsensical imagery, bizarre dialog and bucket loads of sex and violence. Consider the following: Yakuza mob the Anjo clan have recently lost their leader. Right hand man Kakihara goes on a mission to find his boss, despite every suggestion that he might be dead, while fending off attacks from embittered ex-members of his clan who seek its total annihilation. He must also deal with the unwanted attention of gibbering, sexually frustrated retard Ichi The Killer who has a patent for slicing people into pieces with his deadly knife-boots and masturbating in public places. Clearly attempting to bring such a perplexing plot onto a level that a human being could understand was too unrealistic a task for Miike, so he didn't bother. Instead he resorted to filling the film with explicit scenes of torture and mutilation that include a man being methodically impaled with giant needles and burnt with boiling frying oil, a tongue being cut out, an arm being wrenched from its socket and an entire body literally being cleaved in half. Most of the victims of this violence seem more puzzled at being skewered and torn apart then afraid. Indeed the lead character Kakihara, after effortlessly cutting off his own tongue, manages to have a polite yet muffled telephone conversation while blood spits out of his mouth.Obviously the complete disregard for realism is meant to be funny, but the reaction it gets is more like the uncomfortable silence we hear when some idiot tells a stupid joke, and then laughs feebly to himself. This movie leaves you feeling almost as numb and empty as the characters themselves, with a slight residual sense of repulsion.",negative
"When Anjo, a yakuza boss is murdered, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) ,a sadomasochistic man is the only who thinks that his boss is still alive and with his partners he start to look out for the true about his boss. Kakihara believes that the true can come from Susuki (Susumu Terajima), a member of a rival gang that was accuse by Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) but soon he will find that was the wrong man and all was a plan by Jijii. After Kakihara is expel from the syndicate because of his extreme interrogation methods, he is trying to find Jijii with the help of two corrupts detectives twin brothers. Soon he will find that all was made by Ichi (Nao Omori), a mysterious and strange killer who is controlled by Jijii. That is the main plot of this unique and extreme film by Takashi Miike (Audition, One Missed Call). The storyline is nothing but great but my favourites things in this film are the characters and the bizarre situations that Miike creates.The characters: Kakihara is a sadomasochistic man who loves his boss Anjo just because he can make him feel true pain and when Anjo is murdered the only person who can make him feel excited is Ichi, who is going to kill him, so what Miike creates is truly bizarre and amazing: the man who is going to kill Kakihara is the only person that can make him fell excited so he is waiting for Ichi with happiness and he said: ""Ichi don't let me down"". Unique situation in a film. But the most amazing and strange character is Ichi that became the principal character when he supposed to be a secondary character. We just know that he kills his parents and then he was manipulated by Jijii and now have a false memory of be a witness in a rape in high school in which he feel guilty for not stop it. And when a man help him he felt completely different and he don't want to kill more; that man who help Ichi is Kaneko, and ex-cop that now work with Kakihara and that have a son who was saved by Ichi from some bullies. Kaneko is the more human and normal character in the film, he seems to be the only who really suffers for be partner of a man like Kakihara. The other characters like Karen (Alien Sun) or the two corrupt detectives twin brothers are just crazy like Kakihara.About Takashi Miike: He is a unique filmmaker who makes 3 or more films peer year. He seems to direct any kind of films (horror, crime, musicals, comedy) and he said: ""don't call me an artist because i'm not"". For me this is his best work and now and want to look out for more of his films.Violence in the film: when a film has an impact because of it violence like the one that has ""Ichi the Killer"" is because is really well done and there are truly lots of disturbing scenes (like the first torture made by Kakihara and later when he ask for forgiveness) that makes that a film like ""Hostel"" looks like crap, but later there are funny scenes (the blood coming out from the prostitute's neck) that has an influence in films like ""Kill Bill"", so is really unique.Conclusion: this is one of my personal favourites films of this decade because is really original and i can call it as Takashi Miike's masterpiece. The cast is perfect, specially Tadanobu Asano and the characters are amazing and truly memorable just as the storyline. 10 out of 10Collector's Blood Bag DVD: is the best presentation of this film until now. Contains two discs with the uncut version and more than 2 hours of bonus material in which appears a feature with Eli Roth where he express his love to ""Ichi the Killer"". The idea of the Blood Bag is amazing but is not a very good protection for the discs, anyway is an excellent presentation for this film.",positive
"Koroshiya Ichi is DEFINITELY not for the faint of heart. Maybe not even for the strong-willed. However, it is for movie buffs.Ichi can gross out very easily in some scenes, and like some of the best Japanese films, the concepts for these gross-outs are original and horrible. But the storyline easily makes up for all the horror, and anyone who can stomach the film will most likely find themselves laughing at some of the more outrageous gory scenes, in the tradition (but not, in my opinion, the stupidity) of Dead/Alive.I recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in any of the following: Japanese film: Required. Gross-out/gory humor: Required. Mob films: RecommendedAnd generally, anyone who can sympathize with a character who finds life so mundane that he wishes to die in the most interesting way he can.I make it a point to mention that no one is killed by gunfire, but a lot of people die. Just to heighten your interest.8/10.",positive
"This is the second of his films that I've seen, after Audition, and, while I wouldn't call him a genius after seeing these two films, he's clearly got a lot of talent. He's an original artist, that's for sure. Ichi is rather undescribable. It's actually a bit difficult to get into; the plot is difficult to understand for a while. It's more or less a yakuza film, perhaps mixed with a bit of superhero story. A gang boss has been murdered, and his men, lead by the sado-masochistic Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), are out for revenge. They know only the name of the killer, Ichi, and that he's a very messy murderer (the room where the first murder has blood spattered everywhere; even the ceiling is covered, and there's nothing on the ground by guts). Ichi himself takes a while to show up, but when he does he is a snivelling mess (played by Nao Omori). Working as a waiter in a restaurant, he cries when his boss yells at him. It seems that his super killing ability comes from outside, from a man who is controlling him, Jijii (film director Shinya Tsukamoto, whose films appeal much more to me more than Miike's). Having developed a suit with special powers, he gives it to Ichi and convinces him to kill `bullies,' because the same kind of bullies beat him up in high school and even raped his girlfriend. Ichi's memories are sketchy at best; in reality, Jijii invented them, but Ichi is a very impressionable person. I really liked the inventive villain and hero in the film. Kakihara is one of the all-time great bad guys. His character design (which appears on the DVD cover) is wholly original. Even though Ichi is also a very original character, most viewers, I think, will go away with the memory of Kakihara's open maw. I don't know, though. There are so many moments of utter brilliance here, but I really can't get into Miike's sense of pacing. It's certainly unique. People have gone so far as to compare Audition with Ozu. That's simplistic. Miike's films are probably slower to develop than Ozu's! I can appreciate it, but, man, when I'm in the mood to watch something culty and violent, I really would rather watch a faster film, like the ones made by Shinya Tsukamoto. I did have a level of fascination with Ichi the Killer and certainly plan to watch other Miike films in the future (I know at least one more that my video store has so I'll have to pick that up soon).",positive
"Ichi The Killer's storyline is absolutely brilliant and Takeshi Miike has turned the Anime comic into a masterpiece, combining ""love"", comedy and horror. You have to look passed the violence (which is quite humorous at times, ie; the prostitute trying to smile with a bruised face). If you watch this movie with an open mind, you will notice there is not one single dull moment and this is not an exaggeration. The ending is very mind boggling and leaves you to come up with your own conclusion, the soundtrack is awesome and the cinematography is very original; the camera angles displayed in the scene just after the Anjo group is kicked out of the syndicate amaze me, displaying a shot over Kakihara's right hand mans shoulder leaves me astounded, literally. Please, if you come across this movie, i beg you to see it; you certainly will not regret it.Ichi The Killer rocks. 10/10",positive
"Having only seen one Takashi Miike film (FUDOH - THE NEW GENERATION) before this, I was a little apprehensive when reading the back of this DVD. Though I enjoyed FUDOH, it wasn't what I would call a great movie. After reading the synopsis, I expected ICHI to be little more than a PULP FICTION-style thriller. Never a fan of John Woo or filmmakers of that type, I settled in to watch ICHI with slightly lower expectations than FUDOH (which, again, I enjoyed, but did not find great). Boy, was I ever in for a shock. The violence of FUDOH does not even begin to compare with that of ICHI... and FUDOH was one hell of a violent movie! More importantly than that, however, was the fact that beyond its often astounding violence was a great story filled with fascinating characters. Filmed in a super-fast-paced style, ICHI tells the story of ruthless yakuza assassin Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano is absolutely terrifying!), a maniac with a sadistic streak a mile wide and a masochistic streak just as wide, who goes on a rampage to find his boss, who has disappeared with a large sum of money. In his search for the missing ganglord, he quite literally leaves a trail of blood and guts behind him. His outrageously violent methods anger the other members of Japan's organized crime world, to a point that they enlist the help of the mysterious titular character in disposing of the maniac. Ichi remains unseen (or so we think) till well into the film (and his appearance is one of the biggest shocks of all), with only his gruesome handiwork on display till then. It all sounds very ordinary (or at least it did to me), but the beauty of this film (as well, I am led to believe, as Miike's others) is the director's ability to completely pervert the conventions of the crime thriller in order to deliver something that more closely resembles David Cronenberg than John Woo or Quentin Tarantino: this is no hip, tongue-in-cheek gangster comedy. Miike plays for keeps, as evidenced by the frequently disturbing imagery and subject matter. The acting in the film is worthy of mention as well. As stated before, Asano is very effective in the principal role; Shinya Tsukamoto (director of the wonderful TETSUO films) appears as a seemingly cowardly retired yakuza boss with a few schemes of his own; and almost everyone else leaves a very distinct impression (there is one actor in particular, who sounds as though he has some kind of breathing problem, who I will never forget, and I can't remember the character's name). Though often painful to watch (and I mean that in the most literal sense), there is a real and palpable beauty to the proceedings, which is due no doubt in part to the cinematography as well as the great editing. I read a review of this movie somewhere that said it was like one of the ultraviolent movies that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as part of his brainwashing. I find that an amusing comparison, and it should let the viewer know what he or she is in for. I agree with the prevailing opinion among the true fans of this movie that calling ICHI THE KILLER a ""splatter"" movie is almost an insult; I think this is probably one of the best movies of the past decade, and deserves recognition as more than just a gorefest or crime thriller. Plus I love the ending. Since watching this movie I've become a huge fan of this guy's movies. Watch this if you can stomach the violence, and see for yourself what a huge talent the amazingly prolific Takashi Miike really is!!!",positive
"This is a rather silly and childish film that only anyone with fantasies of stumbling upon a ""snuff film"" in their daddy's attic will enjoy. There is no redeeming quality to the movie, no inherent entertainment value (that is, unless you like to see people get tortured for no other reason save that the director thought it would be ""cool"" to have people get unrelentlessly tortured every other scene). This is the kind of film director Miike is notorious for doing. Let's just say that from now on I'll be avoiding that name like the plague. Unfortunately a lot of my American brethrens have deemed the man's name worth something, which doesn't say much about my fellow Americans, does it?",negative
"I've only watched a couple of Takashi Miike's films and I'm not sure what to make of them. They are technically well made but rather haphazard in most other areas. I tend to walk out wondering what it was all about.Ichi is about a missing crime boss and the money that went with him. The story centers on the search for him by a man who will do anything to find him. While I can admire what I was watching on a technical level, I can't really say that I really cared about anything that was going on. I think my attitude is best explained by my admiring all of the pieces, but not caring about the whole. I liked the look of things, say the unique way they have for questioning a rival gang boss, but I can't really say that the sequence really served any purpose, well not in the way it seemed to degenerate into an exercise in, some what funny, cruelty.The film is nasty and graphic and funny, often in the ""should I be laughing at this?"" sort of way. Its far from for all tastes, but I would hope that people are not coming upon this unaware.5 out of 10.",negative
"When the Yakuza boss Anjo disappears with e fortune of his gang, his sadomasochist number one and lover Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) and his men search for him. The mysterious Jiji (Shinya Tsukamoto) arrives in their office and accuses the rival Yakuza Suzuki (Sabu) of abducting Anjo, and Kakihara tortures him trying to locate the boss. When Kakihara realizes that he has committed a mistake, he pays with his tongue to the Yakuza and sooner he finds that the responsible is the psychopath and mentally deficient Ichi, who was abused in his childhood and is sexually repressed, and is controlled by Jiji using his skills in martial arts and blades to eliminate the gangsters.""Koroshiya 1"" is another gore and twisted movie of Takashi Miike, where most of the characters are bizarre and practically all the stylish scenes disclose tortures, perversion and explicit violence. I know his style, therefore there is no surprise for me in what I have just seen; however, unfortunately this movie has a messy screenplay. I did not find the motives for the procedure of Jiji and I did not understand the last scene. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ichi, O Assassino"" (""Ichi, The Killer"")",negative
"Takashi is truly A Master and A Father Of The Extreme Genre. He has the guts to do anything that is the most violent, messed up, sickest things, that will make you squirm like a worm. As for me, I do not find it disturbing at all. I love watching movies like this and I live for this stuff, cause we all know : it's only a movie. The reason I love watching extreme stuff is because it's something new that you don't usually see in an ordinary movie and if you look at it in the positive way like I do, it's actually kind of amazing that all of these visions are brought into a film. My favorite character in this movie, who I believe is one of the most talked-about characters in the extreme genre world till this very day, is Kakihara, played by the Incredible Tadanobu Asano, who is simply perfect and powerful in his performance. He plays a sadistic, cruel, yakuza gangster with a sick twisted slit-mouthed smile, searching for his missing boss. If you are an extreme movie lover and you have never seen this remarkable feature, get ready to be blown away by this ultra violent masterpiece from one of my favorite controversial directors of all time!!!",positive
"OK I love everything horror from the bad 'b' movie to the high budget Blade type flicks...this was so much fun! It had gore that was used just enough to flip you out but not enough to GROSS you out. Loved the dual lead characters as well. BUT I would NOT watch it in dubbed American, be real and select the DVD and read the subtitles like a REAL movie fan, if not you miss a LOT. If you're in the mood for something that can take you for a ride and not leave you behind twisting your head saying ""What did we just watch?"", this is it.A lot of Japanese flicks leave too much dead time in between action/movement this one was timed just right.",positive
"It's easy to see why some people would hold Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" in high regard. It's an ultra violent comic book come to life, with plenty of hip, high style filmmaking from the director and his crew. It's a powerful experience, but a minimalist one: some viewers are likely to be completely turned off, especially considering the fact that the women here don't fare too well. Still, this is effective audacious entertainment from Miike, a man who clearly believes in the adage of ""anything goes"". The story is anything but predictable, and dwells on such themes as sadism and masochism. There are tons of deliciously over the top gore gags, of both the practical and digital variety.Tadanobu Asano stars as Kakihara, a mobster who's coldly determined to find out who is responsible for the disappearance of his crime boss, Anjo. You see, Kakihara loves inflicting pain, and having it inflicted upon himself, and nobody could abuse him like his boss did. While this is going on, a young man named Ichi (Nao Omori) is going around ridding the world of bullies; Ichi has a particular hatred for this kind of person. At least, that would seem to be the case.This would have to rate as must viewing for any fan of hardcore action *and* horror, and for anybody who likes to watch movies for the violence. This is a very insane and very brutal film. Miike takes a couple of minutes to ease us into the story, in the meantime dazzling us with a plethora of quick imagery. He gets deeply committed performances out of his well chosen cast. Asano and Omori are both excellent, as are Shin'ya Tsukamoto and the lovely Paulyn Sun. It isn't long until characters in this tale begin to be tortured, and some of this torture is hard to watch indeed.By the time this is over, the overall effect is rather wearying.Seven out of 10.",positive
"I had read nothing about the movie going into it and didn't know what to expect save that it was about Yakuza. What was presented to me was certainly one of the most violent and disturbing movies I have ever seen. This movie seemed to try to pack in about every depraved and deplorable act human beings are capable of (and a few that defy the abilities of humanity) into one movie.You have Rape, torture, hanging from hooks, burned by hot oil, rape, mass slaughter, disemboweling, dismemberment...did I mention rape? Oh...and lets not forget a guy eating another guys hand, being cut in half, and lots of semen and blood. The blood letting puts Kill Bill to shame.Sprinkled in is a storyline that would have certainly worked well, even without the over the top gore and violence. There were a few scenes I simply could not sit through and had to fast forward. Not that I couldn't handle seeing a woman being raped and beaten for an extended period of time or watching a woman have her breasts sliced off before being beaten to death...It just became a bit to much, violence overload.If they were going for pure shock value they achieved it. If they were going for a great movie, it didn't come together. The almost constant violence and deplorable acts of depravity over powered any story that there was and there was nobody I ended up caring about thus it was impossible to invest anything in the characters save to guess whose next.Ichi was an interesting but, in the end, annoying character who did most of the killing in the film while the sadist Yakuza boss and his men were the main prey although they perpetrated their own violence and torture on their way to their inevitable deaths. Ironically, probably the most disturbing scene was when Ichi's handler removed his clothes to reveal a body builders body.If you like over the top violence and gore, a movie that leaves nothing to the imagination, you will love this movie. I found myself trying to find any other reason why a person would want to watch this movie and had a hard time.",negative
"Kano: Older Brother Kakihara, you were in love with Boss Anjo, weren't you? But it wasn't because you were queer or admired him or something. It was because you loved the pain you felt when he beat you up. That's why you're looking for him so hard, isn't it? Director Takashi Miike has given us a film that is like nothing I have ever seen. I thought I had seen some horror, but this is the ultimate that I have experienced.Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) is a sado-masochist of the highest form. He has brought torture to an art. He works for an equally sadistic boss who loves to beat up women.As to the title character Ichi (Nao Omori), I am still trying to figure him out.I know he is a tool of a hypnotist, used to fight the Yakuza in horrible fashion. Do not watch after eating if you have a weak stomach. The funniest comment I have heard is comparing him to Adam Sandler in The Waterboy. I haven't seen that film, but I don't think Sandler has made any movies like this.I would call this torture-porn and only for those who have seen Saw and Hostel. O, yes, I have seen Takashi Miike's Audition, and there is no comparison.",positive
"Ichi the Killer is either one of the best or worst films you will ever see. If you are fond of rape, torture, and senseless brutality, then this is the film for you. If you are at all bothered by any of the above, this is not the film for you, as its scenes of graphic violence make the Saw series look like Sesame Street.Ichi the Killer takes its name from an emotionally unstable young man who is brainwashed into linking sexual desire with homicidal rage. Woe be unto the unfortunate young woman who attempts to seduce the childlike Ichi. Never fully in control of his own mind, Ichi (Nao Omori) is actually the pawn of a man named Jijii who seems hell bent on revenging himself upon the yakuza boss Anjo's gang. The title is something of a misnomer however, as the film's protagonist is actually one of Anjo's lieutenants with a penchant for S&M named Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano). After Ichi eviscerates Anjo, Kakihara investigates the disappearance. He is elated to discover that Anjo was murdered by what appears to be a total sadist; one with no thoughts whatsoever of his victims' pain. The remainder of the film is dedicated to Kakihara's pursuit of the killer he hopes can grant him the joy of extreme suffering and death.One of the telltale signs of any exploitation film is a complete lack of character development. Within the first few minutes of Ichi the Killer it becomes evident that the women of this film in particular exist as nothing more than objects to be beaten and raped. In one of the more cringe inducing scenes, a prostitute has her nipples sliced off with a razor blade before being stomped to death for the crime of weeping too loudly. I would call the film misogynistic but the men don't make out much better. Ignoring the standard brainwashing, mutilation, and disemboweling that both sexes endure, notable scenes of senseless violence towards men include a man being hung by meat hooks as he has hot tempura poured over his body, Kakihara slicing off his own tongue without anesthetic, and last but never least, a kidnapped man having his arm ripped off by his captor's bare hands just for laughs.There really isn't much of a story to be found in this gore fest. For 123 minutes we are introduced to characters who have no purpose other then to suffer and die in scenes of pornographic violence. There are no moments of growth or discovery. No insight is given into the psyche of Jijii. We aren't even given a back story for how Ichi fell under his control.I see myself as the farthest thing from a social conservative, yet I am appalled by the cult following this film enjoys online. Of the 247 reviews currently hosted on IMDb, the overwhelming majority of them are positively glowing. I imagine these are some of the same types who sent Richard Ramirez fan mail in prison.",negative
"Overflowing with stylised but extremely graphic violence & featuring enough flinch-inducing moments of bloodshed over the course of its runtime, Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer remains one of the most controversial films ever made & is still banned in many nations but despite the gruesome cruelty depicted here, it was nothing but a hilarious ride for me.Based on the manga series of the same name, Ichi the Killer follows the feud between two rival gangs which erupts when the crime boss of one of the gangs disappears & is believed to be kidnapped by the other mob, thus prompting the sadomasochistic yakuza enforcer of the former to carry out his sadistic investigation which leads him to Ichi, a psychologically damaged killer who's the real culprit.Directed by Takashi Miike (best known for Audition & 13 Assassins), Ichi the Killer presents the prolific filmmaker parodying the depiction of violence in media by taking this particular element way over the line and into a realm that turns the picture into a mishmash of playful & painful brutality. Miike's direction takes a no-holds-barred approach and while it carries an unsettling vibe, the poor effects also make it look funny, whether intentional or not.Although the gore content isn't held back and is going to upset & disturb its audience, the tension is still absent from the movie but it succeeds in putting on screen two of the most deranged characters you can probably think of. One of them is Kakihara, the chief enforcer for the yakuza gang with the missing boss & his love for sadism is explicitly displayed here. And if you think the level of violence Kakihara inflicts is as far as it can get, then there's Ichi to prove you wrong.On an overall scale, Ichi the Killer is as excessive, absurd & insane as films can go but the bizarre humour of it all nonetheless lowers the tone a little. There are sequences that'll have you turning away from the screen but within those scenes are also moments that you may find absolutely hilarious. For me, early into the story, Ichi the Killer became a long wait for two of its violence-friendly characters to face-off against each other and was disappointing on account of its notoriety, it's still an experience that won't fizzle out from memory soon enough.",negative
"When the first line of the plot from Wikipedia states: ""Ichi masturbates on an apartment balcony whilst watching a pimp assault a prostitute."", you just know what you are getting yourself involved in. It's Takashi Miike after all, the controversial Japanese filmmaker that embellishes in squeamish violence. Whilst there is no doubt that the onscreen torture and explicit gore warrants the extremities that Miike addresses, it's tonally inconsistent and occasionally dull. A psychologically damaged individual, who has been manipulated into killing, is being pursued by a sadomasochist. The media frenzy when video games became mainstream was inescapable. Miike took that absurdity and conveyed it through visceral killings that have found their own notoriety. Ichi plays 'Tekken 3' every night, and starts to assume the fighting stances of the characters (I do love me some Yoshimitsu). The neck slicing and body chopping from the blade attached to his shoe made for some hilarious death sequences. Although plagued with unnecessary poor visual effects, it created some enjoyment. Conversely, we then have Kakihara who utilises unethical torture methods to get the answers he requires. Suspending Yakuza members with chains hooked to their fleshy backs and piercing them with giant needles. Excellent use of prosthetics and a superbly fun performance from Asano. These darker scenes of torture juxtapose the humorous slicing from Ichi, further emphasising the exaggerative perspective of the media. The problem is the narrative then becomes tonally inconsistent. Once you see one kill from Ichi, your mind becomes numb to the torturing that follows. Ichi is also arguably the less interesting character, succumbing to insufferably childish behaviour. Shifting the narrative focus on him instead of Kakihara coincidentally slowed the plot's pacing as you don't particularly care for him. I'd rather watch ""Kakihara The Torturer"". The ending was underwhelming as well, considering the build up that preceded it. However Ichi remains brutal yet enjoyable.",negative

It is based off a Japanese manga so the violence is also funny at times the film however has very graphic scenes off rape and torture but don't let that throw you off . This is one of the greatest films that belongs in cinema history sadly due to it's content it will always be a cult film .",positive
"This sickeningly violent cartoon-like film is just not for someone like me.... I can imagine that the film is only popular with sadists and masochists who derive pleasure from seeing violence of this type on screen. There is basically nothing supporting the film's use of gore and violence -- the violence itself is so far from realistic that it is more likely to elicit laughs than any other reaction. This seems to be part of the director's style: the movie delivers its gore with a ""knowing wink"" which in itself I find somehow offensive, as if the very existence of this type of depravity makes it so that we the audience have to accept it. That's like going to a restaurant and being served a big pile of dog ***** and someone telling you that it's art because it's ""real"". The hilarious thing is that I had heard about how ""hardcore"" the violence in this movie was but I found it was so extreme that it didn't even work as violence.I find it disturbing that a movie like this with no interesting or developed characters, no substantial story, and no ideas or commentary about any aspect of society or human life other than voyeurism and sado-masochism, is so popular. The movie itself is about as realistic as ""Commando"" or ""Rambo II"" or something like that, but it doesn't even have good action scenes, just an endless succession of torture sequences. I don't object per se to the film's violence, I just yearn for some kind of substantial idea or characters to justify it in some way.",negative
"To be honest I expected to really love this movie, since it seemed to feature all of the ingredients needed to please me; Gore, violence and this all done in a typical Japanese manga style. However ""Koroshiya 1"" is a mess of a movie and more than halve of the time I really didn't knew what I was watching. It's confusing, odd and just not entertaining enough in all, to watch.Takashi Miike is a real cult-director but I guess his work is just not my kind of thing. I doubt if I'm even willing to watching more movies by him now. The movie is good looking and yes also well directed, as weird as it might sound for a movie that I didn't liked watching at all. However some good story telling is a whole different thing and Miike doesn't seem to really handle this directing discipline well. The movie has a true unique style of its own and it mixes bold action with humor. It's filled with some real gruesome sequences and the movie literally features gallons of blood (as well as sperm). It will please the gore fans as well as the fans of Japanese manga. The movie is also based on a comic by Japanese artist Hideo Yamamoto. For me the movie was just almost completely unwatchable for the mess that it was. However I know that there are people who can appreciate this movie and it's style, so simply go judge for yourself whether you like it or not. It's really a matter of taste. If the movie still feels 'right' for you after 10 minutes in, keep watching since it will definitely be your thing.

"Lots of hype about this movie led me to watch it and boy was I disappointed.. Takahara is a great character no doubt but he really lacks any serious depth. The main problem for me with this movie is that it never really goes into the background of Ichi himself and how he came to live with the ""teacher"", muchless how he obtained all his great fighting skills and that ridiculous suit of armor with the 1 on the back. One other thing, for Miike this movie doesn't have much imagination. Ichi kills 2 women exactly the same way. The only reason to really watch this film is that Takahara is a pretty sick dude. I wish they would have went into has background with the ""boss"" more as well and explain where he got his facial scar from..",negative
"Director Takashi Miike is a director who breaks the mold and creates movies that don't hold back. Having already made a name for himself in his home country of Japan it wouldn't be until 2001 that he was noticed by a larger audience here in the US. One could say that happened 2 years earlier with the release of his film AUDITION which stunned audiences with its depiction of torture. But it was ICHI that drew more attention and got him noticed around the world.Let me start by saying that the modern day Yakuza films that were popular in Japan were being made before ICHI was released and Miike had his hand in a number of them. His BLACK TRIAD SOCIETY films are sought after now as well as well as DEAD OR ALIVE. But it was ICHI that cemented his name among fans of the unusual and cinema lovers worldwide.Based on the Manga of the same name, ICHI is the story of a yakuza gang in turmoil. When sadistic mob boss Anjo is brutally killed after beating a prostitute nearly to death by Ichi, a cleanup crew is sneaks in to take care of the scene. The gore strewn room is covered in blood and viscera but the team led by Jijii handles it with ease. When they leave the room is spotless and Anjo's crew has no idea what has happened.With Anjo gone his mob believes he has been kidnapped. The hunt is on for the killer and is led by underboss Kakihara. Kakihara is an unforgettable character, a man seemingly obsessed with sadism and masochism at the same time. It is the image of Kakihara that is most associated with the film, his smile increased by 2-3 inch slits on either side of where it should stop and held together with pins.Finding that Jijii and his crew are in town, Kakihara approached the older man and tells him if he learns of anything to contact him. Jijii passes along information to Kakihara that it might be possible rival boss Suzuki was behind it all. Capturing and torturing Suzuki it isn't until after that this lead proves to be false. To pay penance Kakihara cuts off the end of his tongue and presents it to Suzuki's boss.Realizing the lead was false, Kakihara and his men begin searching for Jijii and his crew. As they begin to follow leads, capturing each man, their standing with their boss comes into jeopardy and the Anjo crew is banished. This leaves Kakihara and his men open to trying to take over the mob they once worked for.As all of this is transpiring Jijii continues to use Ichi to stir things up, killing various people along the way. Ichi is tormented by memories of the past when he was bullied as a child. Now he seeks to right the wrongs of his past by killing these men that Jijii points out are the same as those bullies of the past. It is Jijii who is controlling what is going on. Before the film ends just who is responsible for what as well as who will remain standing is revealed.The movie is visually arresting with a huge color palette used by Miike. The garish clothing worn by Kakihara makes him stand out from the rest of his crew, was if the facial scarification weren't enough. The bright lights of the city explode on screen and the dark alleys offer hidden shadows. It is a city most would not associate with Japan but it puts on display the fact that they too have their locations that run rampant with crime.The two central characters of the film are polar opposites. Kakihara in his bright clothing delights in his sadomasochistic tendencies. Ichi on the other hand is dressed in black and fears the outburst of anger that push him into a psychotic stage. Kakihara is playing a game in his attempt to increase his power, Ichi is just subdued and quiet, sitting alone until instructed to do otherwise by Jijii. Kakihara controls people while Ichi is controlled. A final confrontation between the two is only natural and does happen near the end of the film, saved for the final moments.The film is bold in its depiction of brutality among the different gang members. If AUDITION showed that Miike was unafraid to turn an eye towards torture in his films ICHI shows he would embrace it. He embraces the violence on display and forces the viewer to look as well, depicting it as something that happens, that takes place, even if we aren't aware. While showing someone hanging from hooks located throughout their bodies, the cutting of Kakihara's tongue and the murder of Anjo are brutal for me they didn't compare to the beatings on prostitutes that left them bloodied, black eyed and with swollen faces. Those scenes felt more real and thus more gut wrenching.But for all of that there is a certain beauty to the film. The story telling aspects make it one that you don't want to turn away from, that you want to watch until the end credits roll. On top of that as the film moves forward you begin to realize that the character of Ichi is perhaps one of the saddest characters to ever appear onscreen. I won't say why as it would be too large of a spoiler but trust me, among a vast number of characters who are either gangsters or killers it is Ichi, a killer himself, you feel for by the end of the film.The first time I saw this movie I was only able to see if on a bootleg edition picked up at some convention. Since then it has been released over the years in this country but never like the current format that Well Go is offering now. To begin with the film was originally released in the US at only 117 minutes long to get an R rating from the MPAA. This is the full-length, original 128 minutes cut of the film. A full digital restoration of the film which was done by Emperor Motion Pictures in 2017. The new transfer was done in 4k resolution from a 35mm inter-negative found at L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy. Since then it has been digitally restored and colour graded in 4k resolution. What this means is that this will be the most definitive version of the film with the entire film in the most brilliant picture it's ever been offered in. Extras are sparse but that shouldn't matter. It is the film that is important. With Miike just releasing his 100th film (BLADE OF THE IMMORTAL reviewed her a few weeks ago) and with a number of his films finding their way here via Arrow Video, those who appreciate the films he has to offer will want to make certain that this one ends up in their collection. If you've purchased the film in the past, sell off that old copy and invest in this one. It's the only way to have the complete film in the best format possible. Congratulations to the folks at Well Go for insuring that this film finds a renewed life.",positive
"Nao Omori plays the titular character of Ichi in this off-the-wall splatter comedy. Kakihari is the ultra-sadistic yakuza leader who's after Ichi. Personally, I felt that Kakihari was the more fleshed out of the two. But the film was quite well-acted all around. Tahashi Miike is a rather polarizing director. Either one likes his movies or hates them. I, for one, far in the former. Ichi the killer is a violent film, but for the most part it's an over-the-top cartoon like violence that is hard to be offended by. There's nary a likable character in the bunch. And the ending is a tad hard to wrap your mind around without multiple viewings, however if you simply go with it & submit to the logic of the film you'll find yourself fulfilled & I can't wait to see the prequal (even if it's by a different director)My Grade: B+DVD Extras: Miike & Manga writer Hideo Yamamoto provide commentary;  Photo Gallery; Trailers for ""Samurai Fiction"", ""Pistol Opera"", ""Versus"", and ""Visitor Q""",positive
"I have only a passing acquaintance of ""manga"", and strips like ""Appleseed"", ""Where's Michael"" and ""Gon"" are more my speed than over-the-top gorefests like ""Ichi"". But I can respect a creator's commitment and devotion to utter lunacy if it is done well. And if you are going to adapt ""Ichi The Killer"" from manga to cinema, this seems like a well crafted attempt to take the conventions of the form from one medium to another. Miike doesn't spare the gore, the violence, the misogyny, the black humor, the sexual fetishes or the tricky framing and camera-work, and the results are pretty faithful to what I can recall of the manga version. Especially interesting for me was that the titular hero of the film was actually more of a supporting plot device for the far more compelling character of ""Kakihara"". As the good folks at I-mockery pointed out, the actor who plays Kakihara is like the Japanese version of Johnny Depp. He is the most interesting foreign actor I have seen on screen in many years - he just oozes cool and handsomeness, and I suspect he would even without the piercings, scars, costume and blond wig. And the sadomasochistic character he plays gets almost all the best lines. He pretty much carries the film, but fortunately the rest of the cast (including the guy who plays ""Ichi"") are fine, and integrate nicely into the decadent, violent, nihilistic world that Miike brings to life here. A couple of problems keep me from rating the film higher than a ""7"". First of all, the genre itself is, basically, sensationalistic trash, an exercise in style and posing and shock value. As entertaining as it is, the movie exists for no reason other than to push the barrier and see how much the censors will let it get away with. This wasn't a story that needed to be told. 2nd, I thought that even for sensationalist trash, a couple of the scenes were more violent than they needed to be...the rapes and nipple tortures didn't need to be quite so explicit. (Just my personal taste, not advocating censorship or anything)...Miike was already where he needed to be in creating a world of extreme violence, and he didn't 'need' to throw that crap in. And my biggest problem was that I found the ending frustrating and unsatisfying. I don't insist on a 'happy' ending for my stories, but I do like closure if I can get it. And I still am unclear what Jijii, the man who was manipulating the downfall of the Anjo gang (and the human guided missile Ichi) was supposed to get out of all this...since that does appear to be him hanging from a noose in the last shot of the film. Miike can make the movie he wants, and end it the way he wants (supposedly he is following an Asian cinematic tradition of unclear and unsatisfying endings to stories), but I don't have to like it.Still that won't keep me from seeking out other films by this director. As I said above, I can admire a devotion to lunacy and nihilism if it is well executed and doesn't hedge its bets.",positive
"Ichi is a Japanese guy with Dennis Rodman like, dyed platinum blonde hair, but instead of rebounding a basketball, he kills people in a rather nasty manner; over and over in this overlong and violent crime drama; do not expect the Godfather. The Yakuza make the Italian Mafia seem like choir boys in comparison. Anjo, a mob boss, is brutally killed, along with a prostitute, and his body disappeared, causing speculation that he has taken of with $3 million yen of Yakuza money. Ichi is used as an assassin by Jijii, who is looking to instigate a mob war. The killings escalate, as Ichi kills a pimp, and his prostitute. The guy is seriously disturbed, as gets off by both inflicting and receiving pain. We get a man cutting his own tongue out, another guy having skewers jammed into his ears, and other assorted tortures and rapes to increase the cringe factor to 10; unfortunately, Ichi the Killer is too long, and the brutality grows tiresome at two plus hours.",negative
"ICHI THE KILLER has the distinction of being the only film I've ever given a grade of ""0"" to at my website. (I would give it a ""0"" here, but alas that's not one of the options.) It is, as the subject line states, a snuff film for little boys too afraid, or are unable to, buy actual snuff films.There's no inherent value in ICHI except to suck out your soul and spit it back in your face. There's not even anything remotely entertaining here. No gore for mindless enjoyment.I'm not surprised at all that so many people have rated this film a perfect ""10"". Kids who don't know better believes making a movie without a purpose except to show gruesome and realistic murders is ""groovy and cool"". I'm only in my '20s myself, but I still have my soul intact, thus I am unable to ""appreciate"" this film.Needless to say, I've never been more proud of my inability to ""get"" a film in my life.0 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)",negative
"(contains minor plot spoilers) Ichi is a mentally retarded adolescent, hypnotised into believing he must take revenge on bad people remembered' from his childhood. Not only is he a martial arts expert but he has a large blade that can flick out from one shoe to neatly slice people in half (or at least into several bits, depending how the mood takes him). Rival gangs seek to outdo each other by inventively torturing opposing henchmen and also avoiding the heavily manipulated Ichi. Blood, gore, torture, sexual abuse and masochistic desire for extreme pain fill most scenes, together with what appears to be the contents of several butchers' shops splattered about walls and stairwells as victims are hacked to bits. There is not the careful suspense and structured plot of the director's brilliant earlier work, Audition, nor the humour of the equally gore-filled Troma movies, nor the careful digitalisation that gives shock horror by apparent authenticity as in Irreversible, or even the genuine king-fu fighting of Bruce Lee movies. The cartoon, manga-like quality of the almost continuous gore, torture and mutilation is perhaps the film's chief saving grace.",negative
Ichi The Killer is the infamous 2001 live action adaptation of the Manga by Hideo Yamamoto. And is easily the best live action adaption ever it is also one of the more disturbing movies out there and Takashi Miike delivered on bringing the Grusome Yakuza story to film it easily has the best live action Charcter Design in Kakihara one of the coolest looking charcters ever this film can also be funny at times if you have a dark sense of humor if you like gore films give this film is a must watch it's a 10/10 all the way in acting filmmaking and gore.,positive
"Ichi The Killer is a bloated manga turned film. Takashi Miike is a gore and violence fan to put it mildly. The two meet somewhere in the middle and the combination is unlike any other film you'll see. The downside is you'll very probably be tempted not to see it at all in the first place. A tragic mistake that would be since Takashi Miike is Japan's most hyperactive modern director and this is his craziest project yet outside the horror genre (thus excluding Audition and Visitor Q).Through unprecedented vignettes of gore and cruelty we are accompanied by unsympathetic yet surreal and compelling characters (a psychotic Asano and a hysterical Omori) running in circles after each other and on their R&R time just relishing their own sadism and evil. The film would be downright unbearable if it were'nt so obviously a pitch-black comedy and satire of the yakuza culture. It is a technical achievement for all involved and a groundbreaking work of visual flair and bad taste from Miike himself. The actors are flawless in their comic book roles sure enough but the set-pieces are pure Miike: a man is slashed in half by a razor-tipped kick, a night-club massacre is seen from without with impossible splashes of gore continuously irrupting from the entrance, Asano's Kakihira spouts warrior wisdom (and a fair dose of masochistic none-sense) while his SM girlfriend beats him to a pulp...If none of this makes a naughty part of you laugh or at least grin, stay clear of Ichi, otherwise, see it by any means necessary.",positive
"I know many people think that the violent and gore movies coming from Japan are the best thing since sliced bread, but frankly...I don't share that opinion. At least not when it comes to Ichi The Killer ( popular American release title ) This film is way overrated and can easily be skipped. Not like Battle Royale (just to give one example) wich is a whole lot better. It looks like a magna-story and I'm not quite sure if it was meant to be like that. The hero is a funny looking young man with blond hair. At least he's separable from all the other, resembling, characters. This sir is very special to say the least! There are two long cuts on each side of his mouth. When he smoke a cigarette, the smoke comes out through these cuts!! That was pretty funny in a very stupid way.Not cool or anything. He does very weird stuff like cutting off his own tongue. Talking about motivation ! It's meant to be some sort of apology towards a gang-leader whom he almost tortured to death. Anyway, that's what the whole story is about. A gang-leader got kidnapped and his closest and most violent assassin does everything to find him back. He's the only one who's still convinced the leader is alive...I agree that Ichi, the Killer contains lots of violence. But I don't think it's artistic or breaking new grounds or anything. I don't even think it's disturbing...Disgusting is a more appropriate word. I love a good amount of gore in my movies but there was something wrong with this. It left me ice cold and I don't recommend this movie to anyone. There are a lot better Japanese horror/action-Thrillers to check out, or better yet...the nowadays Spanish film beat them all. My humble opinion on Ichi, The Killer ... 3/10",negative
"After being a fan of Asian horror for so long it definitely took me way too long to get to this film. Based on the manga of the same name, this cult masterpiece from renowned director Takashi Miike (One Missed Call), this follows Kakihara on his search for the man who killed his mob boss.Now this movie is probably well known for the fact is it gory. It is shameless in its cult tropes, including sexual assault, beatings, torture and gory deaths. In fact, when it was first debuted at a film festival, the audience received barf bags with the movie's logo on it as a gimmick. I have no doubts some of those bags were actually used.Ichi the Killer is dark and twisted. The torture scenes do not leave anything to the imagination in its full graphic imagery. Miike truly outdid himself in this bloody twisted plunge into the yakuza.But strangely enough, it actually bored me a little bit. When coming into this, if you've seen the trailer for the film, you've pretty much seen all the most horrifying contents of this film - and if you're a gore horror fan this is probably the only reason why you're watching this film. It was disappointing, to a small degree, that the parts of the film that either intrigued audiences to watching or horrified them were already broadcast throughout this film leaving only two or three scenes to truly shock the audience if they've seen the trailer.
That being said, however, the story is intriguing. Although it seems mundane especially at first, the plot line is twisting and surprising at times. I found it enjoyable to go through the story as things began to twist out of proportion, as they didn't make sense before they linked up in unbelievable ways.Everything about it really keeps the audience captive throughout the movie and I find that's something hard to do in a movie like this. Gore films are usually splatter-horror, disgusting images on the screen to shock the viewer and keep their stomachs twisting with little thought to plot or the plot suffering as an afterthought. Many plot-driven horror films also end up story driven, without much gore or shock-horror within them to make the audience's stomach churn, but Miike truly got the best of both of these aspects into one film.
However, I feel like the storyline became rushed at the end of the movie coming up to the final fight scene and I feel like perhaps they cut some of the script out for timing issues which were a shame. There could have been more to it and things didn't feel quite right when it finally ended. There were also a few loopholes that didn't get closed in the final scenes before the credits which made me hope for a sequel, yet I don't think any plans have been thought up or ever will be.The acting in this was something special, in my opinion. It must have been hard for the actors to go through these gory scenes without flinching, cringing and such, even with it not being its full content within filming. I can't think how many takes some of the scenes must have taken. Each character is well developed, is completely three dimensional.
Asano Tadanobu and Omori Nao in their respective roles were truly amazing. Each of their characters felt completely real - like these were people who could be living down the street to you or you might pass when walking down to the shops. They truly brought the characters to life in all their sick ways and it was stunning to see.Overall, I think this is a movie you only really watch once. This movie is a lot for most people and I don't think many people could stomach the thought of watching it again. However, I think this does have a certain rewatch value to it for the gore/slasher horror fans that come across it. It has a certain charm of disgust that chills the soul and sends goosebumps down the spine. It's deliciously wicked in disgusting ways and Miike definitely made a mark in the slasher-horror genre with this. I don't think another movie could ever stand up to the legend this classic has created.",positive
"Definitely a cult classic with all the elements: Drama, action, a basic storyline, and lots of violence and some sex. If you are troubled with the idea of torture, even though on screen, IMO, it's not as terrible as some people have claimed (for example Tarantino's Kill Bill series), then stay away from this movie. We have a basic premise that within a small area are 2 major yakuza, or organized crime gangs, along with fringe gangs. Those that were kicked out of one of the gangs or never made it into one. The big boss, or father (I'll get back to this theme) goes missing and his loyal henchman, Kakihara, is out to find out where he has gone, since also missing is a lot of money. That part of the story was never that clear. Why would this man have with him so much money when all he was doing was getting with his favorite prostitute to have some sick sex? Kakihara is your extreme sado-masochist who puts his heart and soul into what he does. Literally. He takes his job seriously and likes to make sure it's done right, so we get a lot of scenes full of violence. So while he is out torturing and killing members from the other gang and the fringe gangs he suspects had something to do with the disappearance of his boss (who he loves like a father) , as well as using some police to help in his hunt and torture tactics, we also have a young man, Ichi, being told what to do by Jijii, which is to kill even more gang members. This is a typical master and puppet scenario and it was not until I read through all the posts and thought back over specific scenes that this movie began to make sense. This is not just a violent movie with a lot of mentally sick people (as everyone was) thrashing about, but a story about fathers and sons. Literal and figure fathers. We have the crime boss who is Kakihara's ""father,"" but somewhere in the beginning of the movie, with all the flashbacks and quick lines about how he liked being tortured as well as torturing people, I got a sense that Kakihara's father was behind all of what was going on and that this person was Jijii. But Jijii cannot be the person who performs these deeds, so needs a puppet to control in order to do this as there are so many people that must be dealt with first to get to the real target. Enter Ichi, a mentally disturbed young man who is easily manipulated. So Jijii sends Ichi out to wipe out everyone on his way to the final person who Jijii really wants to kill: Kakihara. This would explain the final scenes, especially the one where Jijii is moving aside the hair on Kakihara's face. It's not to see if Ichi sliced him, but a loving and caring gesture that a parent would do for one's child (let's say if the child is sick or dead). That was the 1st and only thing that came to mind when I saw this scene and for me confirmed my 1st thought that there was a link between Jijii and Kakihara. In that scene we see the happiness on Jijii's face that he got his revenge, but also the sadness because this was his son and now his only son is dead. Ichi did not kill Kakihara because Ichi could not follow through, as he was too emotionally depleted to do much more than lie on the ground and cry (after killing who he thought was his brother). It is what Kakihara wanted and he envisioned this scene to give himself closure. Plus, shoving needles into one's brain through your ears (think lobotomy) could cause some mental lapses to occur. So Kakihara kills himself and Jijii has closure and now can kill himself. This frees Ichi from the puppet master and being manipulated and sets it up for a sequel.",positive
"This is one of those that (if you love it) you will only feel comfortable recommending to a select few people. Yes, there are a certain breed of us that revel in the depraved and obscene, but if you thumb your nose at the current wave of what many consider to be ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"", then ""Ichi"" is right up your alley and probably what you consider a part of your comfort zone. Yessir, this one has it all. Gore? Well, you get that in spades. Engaging characters? Look no further. For me, it's not so much that, but then again it IS the characters and the effect that they have on each other. Relationships are a big part of what drives this movie and through the plot twists and emotional punches that Miike throws, it's the characters that draw you back...for repeated viewings, that is. The blood and guts are secondary. Takashi Miike works more than most any director today. Yeah, some of his stuff is hit and miss, but this ranks right up with his best work.",positive
"Not being from the school of 'manga' or 'anime,' (I don't even know what those words mean) I went into this film as purely a horror fan. I heard it was gory and rather insane, so I had to check it out. What I got was a nice rude introduction to the world of Takashi Miike.The plot is simple, a Yakuza boss is whacked, his gang is looking for the killer. The killer, as it turns out, ends up being someone who is unlike any killer in any film I've ever seen, and it's just perfect. There are enough twists and turns to keep you glued to the screen. There is enough blood and guts to satisfy the hungriest of gorehounds. And there is enough shock to shock pretty much anyone out there. Miike really has a knack for capturing violence; violence between humans as an ugly but real truth.Since seeing ""Ichi the Killer,"" I have really gotten into Takashi Miike, I own like ten of his films. He's that kind of director, you just want to see all of his stuff if you like one film.I'd say this film is a must see for horror fans. As for those of you who dress up like foxes and sailor girls, I don't really know. Yea, check it out.8 out of 10, kids.",positive
"Lets get this out in the open, Ichi the Killer is a very disturbing piece of work. Anyone who claims that ""everyone should watch this"" is misinformed, as this would be rather a bad idea.I've seen worse it terms of gore, I found the psychological torture of the viewer to be more unsettling. I do not hate the film, but I do see it as a firework, it bangs, it flashes, I went ""ooh"" and ""aah"" and walked away to watch something slightly more intelligent.I may be giving the director too much credit here, but maybe he's giving us a sick, twisted film to show us just what the human mind is actually capable of; extreme horror, pain and evil. if you enjoyed it, ask yourself why you thought OTT stylized violence is cool, if you didn't enjoy it, ask yourself why. If a human is capable of creating this much hatred, what is wrong with the world? We watch but we don't think, we take what we see in, but don't evaluate.The editing is slick, the special effects are not really realistic, they're just there to impress you, and if you can see through them, they are rather silly. Which leaves the question; why show us this kind of violence if it's not in the slightest realistic? Style. Remember, sexual violence isn't cool, so if you do sit down to watch this film, have a serious think about what you want from a movie, there have been several good reviews here, and they all touch on the same point; whatever you're expecting, you'll be wrong.",negative
"OK, let's get it out in the open. Koroshiya 1 is the most misogynist, violent, sadomasochistic, sexist film ever made. Yet I found myself loving this film. In some ways, this film could be considered deplorable: people are slowly tortured in the most original way, women are beat and killed in horrid ways, and the film is openly sexual. But where it catches you is in identifying with the characters. Kakihara, really the main character, is probably the best bad-a** villain you'll love since Scarface. He is quiet, yet when he exacts his vengeance, his violent inner self is let out one sickening misdeed at a time. On the other hand, you have Ichi, the main character, who is the kid from high school who bullied all the time, but when pushed to the limit, wreaks a quick and terrifying vengeance. Kakihara gives pain because he doesn't get enough; Ichi gives pain and death as a sign of affection and vengeance. So in turn, this turns from a violent action film to a bloody S and M romance. If you have the stomach to stand all the violence (which is comic-book-like, but still horrendously graphic), put this at the top of your list to see. If you can't get into the story, you'll at least like a lot of the photography and action scenes.8/10",positive
"I had no idea what was going on here. The Director, Mike Takeshi (An American of Japanese descent) is obviously a man filled with hate and dirty thoughts. Most of his films are filled with the most disgusting scenes this side of witnessing an insane man jogging at dusk near a duck pond with a couple of chocolate fingers protruding from his ears and his slippers made from potato skins. Itchy was filmed not with a traditional camera, but one made from blood. The story if you can even call it a story involves a cry baby who likes to dress up in kinky leathers. He goes around killing people with his shoes he covers their mouths and nostrils with them until the smell overwhelms them) and crying while he does it. I think there was a ghost inside him which was controlling his body, and all the real person could do was cry while the ghost killed everyone. Meanwhile another mental in a different part of the city is looking for someone equally psychotic to fight. He likes causing and feeling pain- we see several gruesome acts he partakes in including giving birth to a cow, cutting holes in his face so he can smoke out of them, attaching a man named Frank to a pile of fishhooks and pulling his flesh off, and juggling the sawn off legs of various prostitutes. Later he goes as far as tucking his trousers into his socks and pretending to be Woody Allen in need of a toilet. This is most disturbing. Eventaully the twain shall meet and have a fight to the death for no reason on the top of a roller-coaster while men with rocket launchers in their coats watch on.I don't know what Mike was trying to say with this display of butchery and vulgarity. Perhaps that because we live in such a violent society we should all grab a lump of flaming coal and begin stoning everyone we see in the greengrocers. I usually like his films, but I hated this one and so far I haven't liked any of his others. I love violence in my films, people being blown up and shot etc, but this goes too far. I don't know anyone who wants to see an 8 minute scene of someone having their eyelids pulled open by a clothes peg and their eyes 'soothed' with a cheese grater. Nor do I wish to be part of the not tasteful flashbacks of crying boy's youth where his PE teacher made him eat fireworks before the fuse finished burning and they went off in his mouth. Such things are the product of a truly sick mind; the mind of a man who has no place in this world or the next. It is the sight of a mind collapsing; a mistake. Worse than realising that you have run out of nappies after a night of curry and Guiness followed by a vicious mid morning stomach spillage.Best Scene: The 2 guys fighting on the roller-coaster at the end, the camera swings to a wide view where they fight while jumping over the roller-coaster carts and avoiding rockets being fired at them. This was clearly inspired by Super Smack Brothers on the Nintendy.",positive
"Unless you have the IQ necessary to appreciate an utterly nonsensical film because it's, like, really ""disturbing"" and ""gory,"" skip this waste of time. Save for crying-killer-bops-off-bad-guys there is zero plot to it. Possibly the most absurd point was when a character, shortly before making short work of some guy, decides to kick off his shoes and take off all his clothes to reveal a bodybuilder's physique, complete with G-string underwear and the obligatory flexing.Idiotic and nonsensical. Stay away if you'd like an actual plot, or even a justification for this film's existence.By the way, the ""gore"" isn't even that impressive, save for its occasionally pointless violence, but even the blood and guts is done in a manner that is often cartoonish and, like the rest of the film, plain silly - when it's not testing your patience, of course.",negative
"""Ichi The Killer""'s violence makes ""Reservoir Dogs"" look like ""Snow White"". Its visual ""style"" makes MTV video directors look like cutting-edge, brilliant artists. And its plot makes most Steven Seagal story lines seem intelligent. Writing a long review about something so meaningless is meaningless in itself, so I'll sum up the movie in four words: revolting, incomprehensible, numbing, overlong. For anyone who liked, say, ""Nekromantik"", it's a sure bet; for all others...0 out of 4 stars.P.S. I watched the uncut version on a DVD that included an interview with director Takashi. The guy is a pretty boring talker, too.",negative
"I really don't see how someone can not love this movie. Sure, there are those who might be offended by the hyper violence, the gore, the perversion, the bizarre body piercing and mutilation, the rubber suits or whatever...but I haven't met any of those people. This movie just rocks! The bottom line is that this is something that no American studio would ever produce which is what makes is so engaging to watch as an American viewer. It's just so far from the average Hollywood sameness. Take the ending for example. The first time I saw this movie every instinct about plot predictability that Hollywood has conditioned into my head over the years made me believe that Ichi would save and protect the young boy and they would ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after. Ichi is the tormented one who sees himself in the little boy and sees the opportunity to right all the wrongs that were done to him by saving him, so what does he do? Well....watch the movie and you'll see but obviously it's the opposite of saving the kid. But then again, in Ichi's mind I'm sure he was saving the kid by preventing a possible life of suffering like he has had to deal with.If you have a weak stomache, there might be some uncomfortable moments in this film but I liken it to Peter Jackson's Dead Alive in that the gore in this movie is so over the top and unrealistic that you can't take it too seriously. I mean, look at the seen after Ichi first puts on his rubber super hero suit and takes out a few victims and we see the aftermath of the room completely covered on every wall in blood and bits of flesh with so much blood dripping off the ceiling that you would think that a there was a flood on the floor above.And what's up with Ichi's rubber suit? It just adds to the comic bookness of the whole movie. I really need to go out and pick up some of the anime that the movie was based on.Obviously not for everyone, but anyone that can deal with comic book style hyper violence and gore will love this and it will certainly help to expand the mind of any viewers that are used to Hollywood predictability",positive
"As a big fan of the horror genre, I must say that Takashi Miike is one of my favorite contemporary directors. True horror films combine many different cinematic genre: comedy, action, drama, etc. Miike creates a brilliant fusion of melodrama, tragic comedy and horror in Audition, for example. Ichi is more of an action flick. I'm not a fan of the so-called ""torture porn"" - I find it rather boring. Therefore, what I find fascinating about Ichi is that, no matter how graphic it gets, I somehow never get the feeling of it being over the top. Most of the violence is so grotesque that it lacks realism and there are many comic-relief moments throughout, which seems very suitable for a film that's based on a graphic novel. Of course, this film isn't for everyone, and it's absolutely hilarious to me when people write how disgusted they are - this isn't a Disney film, nor has it ever been advertised as one. But for those who can appreciate extreme horror without prejudice, this film is definitely worth watching.",positive
"If you're a teenager looking for cheap thrills, or a way to test how much (fake) violence you can stand to watch, 'Ichi the killer' may do the trick. But if you're just a little bit older and have gathered some deeper real life experience, this film will not be able to shock or scare you, simply because it has no true emotion and absolutely no connection with reality. The one feeling you're most likely to get from it is plain and simple disgust. So, since you only live once, there are some questions you can ask yourself before you decide to give precious time away to director Takashi Miike and his crew: * 1) Do I want to watch several lengthy scenes of ridiculously exaggerated sadistic torture that is produced only with the intention to shock or disgust me? * 2) Do I want to see repeated scenes where men with the apparent intelligence of a rabid caveman brutally beat, rape and mutilate women? * 3) Do I want to spend 2 hours watching a bunch of grown-ups behave like one dimensional cartoon characters performing random acts of fantasy violence, barely held together by a story that has roughly the same depth and meaning as the testimonials on some TV shopping network? If your answer to the above is yes, then 'Ichi' will provide for your desire. But if your answer is no, then trust me, you're better off watching a few minutes of world news for shock value and then you can spend the rest of your evening doing something more rewarding.I rate 'Ichi' 3/10 because hollow as it is, there are quite a few other creations that easily manage to go one or two steps further down the spiral. Sad but true.",negative
"I really didn't expect this movie to be so disturbing and raw. Ichi the killer as the title already gave a hint for the gorefest and violence. I have seen a lot of different movies and consider myself having a strong stomach with violent, blood ridden films. But by far this is the hardest movie to watch for me. I even stopped it a few times just to think about continuing or not. But I did, the characters were engaging at the same time viciously scary to watch.The way violence, sexual sadism and torture portrayed was sickening as it is so raw. The difference with this movie from others is that a lot of the content are actually possible and have a sense of reality. Thats the scary part, unlike horror films just imagining these horrific acts is torture itself to a weak perception of a viewer.There are some dark humour within, very few, unlike Versus which I prefer, because the mix of humour eased the tension of all the violence. In any case, this isn't for everyone, but the film was actually well acted on and well made. Ichi and kakihara, of course stand out.FInally just to give you an insight before you see it, there is a lot of sadistic violence sexually and torture. The one that really stuck with me is, an insane kakihara cutting of his own tongue(yes i stopped it at this part), the violent rapes, you get the picture. I only recommend it to those who has a wide perception and a strong, matured concept of reality. As they say not for the faint of hearts.",negative
"I had heard from a number of people that Ichi The Killer was one of the most violent and disturbing films they had ever seen. In this respect the film emphatically lived up to its expectations and delivered what is truly a very graphic and intense display of ultra violence, torture and misogyny unlike any other film I have seen. Ichi The Killer also boasts some decent acting, a well thought out soundtrack and some excellent cinematography peppered with colourful scenes magnificent in terms of composition, set design and costume. These visual aspects of the film I found rewarding and they attest to the skill of the cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto and the director Takashi Miike.Despite these aspects of the film, my enjoyment of Ichi The Killer was marred by its visceral and intense display of violence that for me went far beyond the call of duty. Ichi The Killer is an adaptation from a comic and consequently the violence in it is displayed in a comic book style à la Kill Bill Volume 1. Unlike in the aforementioned Tarantino film where the violence combines with the plot, enhancing the overall comic-cum-pastiche style of the film, the violence in Ichi is relentless and prolonged to an extent that I thought undermined the effect of the film as a complete work. Any appreciation or enjoyment of the film was secondary to my reactions of disgust or frustration towards the autonomous violence that seems to infest the film, somewhat suppressing its finer qualities.The comic itself can only illustrate the brutality and violence in single dimensions, and consequently much is left up to the imagination, allowing the reader to feed their own vision into the frame. However when these scenes are committed to film the ultra violence becomes stated, trivialised and more lucid than when in a comic. This perverts what originally relied on imagination, and turns it into something ugly and over the top.",negative
"Nothing else to say - Because that honestly says it all! I originally thought Kill Bill was novel - no longer If you haven't seen it, I would suggest that it is a combo of Kill Bill 1 and Hellraisers on steroids.I could NOT take my eyes off the screen long enough to take a single bite out of my dinner. That statement is true! For 2 hours I did not move my eyes from the screen. In hunger, I eventually moved the plate up to my mouth in an attempt to shovel the food straight in No use  it was cold.What sick twisted brilliant mind could think of such a thing? The characters are simple minded. And the vulgarity is stirring. But that is what makes it sublime.",positive
"Ichi the Killer sounded like one of those cool, adventurous Japanese action films filled with violence galore. It seemed,however, the violence in this motion picture were more than what I expected. They were so macabre and so well done. And my God, Ichi the killer, was something else, he was more than a killer. The killing scenes in this film were so stomach churning, they would make you want to vomit. They looked so real!! And the music will get your heart pounding in a split second as you watch each scene in Ichi The Killer.This film is very well recommended to those who are fans of macabre Japanese films. This one was da bomb!",positive
"Miike takashi is a film maker you have to admire and to me is one of the best filmmakers today working in cinema, and proves that Japanese cinema at the moment is producing films that are far better than most American films. ICHI THE KILLER proves this. Its both a funny, almost absurdist, nightmarish ride and at the same time an intelligent, serious, and disturbing examination of the futility of violence. The central character of Ichi, a shy and redundant young man at day, but under hypnosis becomes a violent and deadly killer, is the central ""superhero"" yet unlike, and a lot like most of your average superheroes Ichi has some serious flaws, including a disturbing fascination with rape, provoked by an incident in his childhood of seeing a schoolgirl getting raped by fellow classmates(again another made up story to provoke him to kill the bad guys), and unlike a superhero Ichi is being forced to kill the ""bad guys"", under hypnosis by Jiji, a former yakuza member played by TETSUO director Shinya Tsukamato. The cast play the roles superbly, especially the actor (sorry but can't remember his name) who plays Kakihara, the masochistic gang leader of the anjo clan. Kakihara is both charasmatic and disturbing, willing to hurt himself just as much as other people, and he develops a fascination with Ichi almost seeing him as a partner in pain, who can replace his other pain partner and mentor, Boss Anjo, a recent target of Ichi. Many have labelled the film msogynistic, and i would disagree, as even though women are treated badly in the film the men are also treated violently, even worse, just witness the scene where Kakihara tortures a man by hanging him from the ceiling with hooks. The violence towards the female characters is disturbing, especially the opening scenes of the rape and beating of the prostitute who Ichi develops a fascination with. Yet also the violence overall can be seen to be sticking to the original anime comicbook source, as we see blood gush out in fountains, from victims throats and a man getting cut in half, down the middle of his body. Theres a lot more that i could talk about this film, though i highly recommend it as it is both wildly original and frankly brilliant filmmaking.",positive
"Ultra-violent, and good. The main reason most people will remember this is for the violence and gore. It's pretty weird and extreme, bordering on gratuitous. However, despite all this, it all feels quite realistic and gritty.Plot is reasonably interesting, filled with a multitude of characters whose story you care about. Maybe too many characters - it dilutes your engagement with any one person.Decent performances all round. Tadanobu Asano steals the show as the over-the-top insane and sadistic, yet ice-cool, Kakihara. Nao Omori is maybe too shy and retiring as Ichi - it wore thin after a while. Not a big problem though.",positive
"I think a lot of people have simply missed the point of this film. People either love it or hate it based upon the amount of gore and violence in it. But what if Miike pulled a trick on all of you? The majority of the violence takes place off screen, and most of what you do see is completely outrageous and not meant to be taken seriously.Make no mistake about it, this movie is about love. Sick and twisted love, but it's love none the less. Kakihara's search for a new lover and Karen's desire to win Kakihara's heart are the prime examples. It's something we all want, but these characters go to extreme ends to acquire it. The characters are all amazingly defined and well written. But the one that everyone seems to have no clue about is Jijii played by Shinya Tsukamoto. We all know he wants to destroy the Anjo group but why? Well it doesn't matter. Jijii is Takashi Miike, the director personified within the film. Think about it. His sole purpose is to set the characters on their paths to the final confrontation. He even exhibits god-like powers. This is evident when he tells a lesser character ""Ichi has more important matters to take care of"" and disrobes to reveal a bodybuilder's physique. This is a prime example of the intricacies that Miike has layered about the film that nobody seems to pick up on. When you combine all that Miike has slipped below the radar with the brilliantly written character's, Miike's amazing style and some of the most unnerving music I've ever heard you have an instant classic. I recommend everyone take a second look at this movie and analyze what you've seen, because I can garuantee that you didn't even begin to pick up on all of it.Some viewers will witness the rape and murders and dismiss it as exploitive dribble, but that's simply not the case here. It's an excellent well crafted picture I believe everyone should experience.",negative
"Based on a Manga series by Hideo Yamamoto Ichi the Killer is a well renounced cult hit and controversial because of its bloody violence. It is a very required taste of a film.In the Japanese underworld a major boss disappears and his loyal sadomasochistic lieutenant Kakinada (Tadanobu Asano) sets out to find out what happened to him, torturing his way to the truth. On the way Kakinada clashes with his Yakuza bosses as a gang conflict starts to happen. Unknown to the Yakuza their bane is a traumatised man called Ichi (Nao Omori) who is lead by Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) to get rid of the bullies who picked on Ichi.Takashi Miike is a director known for challenging Uwe Boll for prolificacy, but unlike Dr. Boll, Miike is considered talented. Miike does have a very distinctive style, using a lot freeze frames during the beginning and using hand-held cameras. There is one delicious scene when Kakinada and Karen (Alien Sun) go into run down apartment building to a drug dealer's apartment where the camera follows the pair to Kakinada torturing the dealer. Some of the violence is a very brutal and inventive, particularly when Kakinada is torturing a Yakuza boss and results in a funny dark joke. Ichi the Killer is a visually striking film with it uses of colours and camera styles.But Ichi the Killer is an a very disjointed and confusing film, not know quite what it wanted to be, who to focus on and does the cardinal sin of not giving us any a likable character. Of course some films can get away with it but that is the exception rather then the rule. You did not know who the follow, who was who or even what type of film Ichi the Killer was trying to be; was it a crime film, a psychological thriller, a violence horror or a really dark comedy. It was a mix-match. Even the violence ranged from really grim, unconformable and sadistic torture scene involving hooks and boiling oil being poured over a man's back and head, a scene which need a really strong stomach, to the juxtaposition of other violence being very cartoonry looking and makes similar scenes in Kill Bill look restrained.Asano's character is basically The Joker: he dresses in purple suits, has bright blonde hair, is a sadistic torturer who is creative with his techniques and has a dark scene of humour. He is a major crime figure, rules his gang with an iron fist, has a massive Chelsea grin and uses sewing needles as a weapon. It was more of a distraction then anything else.The score at times can be over bearing as well. Considering the type of film it is I would not expect a traditional orchestral score and a techno score is more fitting. But at times it overshadowed the action on the screen and did not fit with what was happening, particularly an early scene with a very heavy percussion base to it.Ichi the Killer is just an ultra-violence slog which is not as fun as it should have been and set in a moral vacuum. It was a confusing mess of film and there are better films from the Far East in this genre, Battle Royale and Oldboy come quickly to.",negative
"I'm definitely a fan of Takashi Miike by any standard. I am yet to see a film by him I dislike, but much like ""Izo"" there are a few of his titles that I don't think live up to par with the rest of his work. This is one of those movies.Ichi the Killer is a movie that, on the surface, appears to be all for fans of gore, senseless violence, and madness. And while it does have all these things and will likely appeal to those kinds of fans, it (much like his other works) is much more than that. I won't try to express the film's meaning (or at least how I took it's meaning) because all of Miike's films are something you just have to experience for yourself, if I tried to summarize it I would confuse or bore you.The reason I think this film isn't as good as his others is because even though it was, as far as the plot, acting, and general concept, a great movie, most people who are not familiar with this sort of work won't see it as that. This movie doesn't do as good of a job at SHOWING its symbolic nature and (again, much like Izo) comes off as a movie that is bizarre for the sake of being bizarre.Oddly enough, this happens to be one of his most linear films, and if you've seen it but not many of his others, you will wonder how it can be considered linear. Any fan of Miike's films will know what I mean, though. Anyhow, moving on.To those of you who are familiar and/or fans of Takashi Miike, I won't even try to explain this film to you for two reasons. -1. You've probably seen this all ready. -2. You know it's just something you have to watch yourself.To those of you who are NOT familiar with his work, and/or aren't into having to think when watching a film, this movie has a few things you might want to know before watching it.-The film, for the first (I'd say) 30 minutes seems like your typical Japanese crime drama, granted a bit more sadistic than usual, and after that point you run into Ichi... this is where the bizarre, animesque qualities come in. Ichi sports a full-body suit that extends a blade from the foot. While this appears to be his only weapon, it is, indeed, quite effective. -If you really want to get a general idea of what this movie is... picture a Yakuza Crime-Drama combined with ""the Guyver"". It isn't quite as sci-fi as the ladder mentioned, but you'll get the idea once you see it.Either way, if you are a fan of Takashi Miike, bizarre yet symbolic films, Yakuza films, gore, and/or sadism... you might as well watch it, because there's a good chance you'll like it. But do NOT watch this film expecting it to be one of Miike's better movies, or if you've heard it's AMAZING. It's really not as good as a lot of his other movies. It's very good, though.",positive
"The first film of Miike's that I watched had been the disquieting AUDITION (2000); then, during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, I attended a screening of his incomprehensible IZO (at which the director himself was present).The third effort from this new Asian infant terrible, then, is closer in tone and effect to the second: a gore-drenched gangland drama which one is supposed to find shocking (and many actually seem to think of as a black comedy!)  but, to me, it felt merely gratuitously repulsive. Besides, the narrative is inordinately confusing: given all the obnoxious characters on display, I eventually gave up trying to make head or tail of it (the ending is particularly head-scratching).Miike so clearly intended this film to be the sickest yet made (thankfully, the version I caught was snipped by a little over 3 minutes) that he also inadvertently made it one of the all-time silliest! Incidentally, I had mistaken the masochistic villainous gang leader for Ichi since it's he who appears on the poster and in all the stills I've seen from the film; actually, the titular character is a neurotic wimp who turns messily murderous when crossed! In the end, while I adore the classic Japanese cinema  the more stylized the better (I'm lukewarm on Ozu and similar family-oriented contemporary dramas)  I have to say that the extremist approach of today's exponents leaves me cold for the most part...P.S. Film-maker Shinya Tsukamoto appears in the film as Ichi's 'master'; I had intended to follow ICHI THE KILLER with a viewing of that director's BULLET BALLET (1998)  but my negative reaction to the former, not to mention Tsukamoto's own TETSUO films (1988 and 1991; the only ones I've watched so far), quickly changed my mind!!",negative
"You can sit in on Ichi the Killer and enjoy a spiralling violent ride into nihilism.  You can dissect it for all the hidden meanings, find the thematic closure to another Miike film, Audition, in Kakihara.  Either way you can enjoy the film, provided movie violence doesn't bother you (and then it still probably will).Every other review will say this movie is stylish.  There we go.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I must say that this film, especially coupled with Audition, would make for a fascinating psychological study of sadism, masochism, and Takeshi Miike.  The most striking part of this movie, I thought, was the deeply sexual connection it made between love and violence. Sure, other films have talked about the darkness of man, but few, if any, have made it so Freudian or tied it in so tighly with sexuality.  Killing for pleasure and sex for pleasure are decidedly unique among humans.  This movie is courageous in that it is unafraid to throw both of these at us.This movie is highly recommended.  Wear your thinking cap or don't.  You can marvel about the implications of Kakihara cutting his own tongue out or your can gaze in awe at the incredible outfits he wears.  The choice is yours and, if you can view it with an open mind, you will enjoy.",negative
"After reading all of the positive comments about this film, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy. Last night, I did, and all I can say is Thank Goodness I didn't shell out for the DVD. This film is silly in the extreme. How could anyone take this seriously? It fails as drama, it fails as comedy, and as for the so called gore, YAWN. I've seen better special effects in student films. Red paint and pig intestines abound, and a crybaby killer slices one victim completely in half with a 3 inch blade that pops out of the heel of his boot. This is particularly effective in dismembering 2 1/2 inch thick opponents! By the way, that isn't Ichi on the cover of the DVD. That's the costar doing a bad impression of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. If you enjoy bad films, skip this and watch ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" instead. At least that film has a somewhat coherent plot line.",negative
After hearing about this from a lot of people as being a gruesome and disturbing movie I finally decided to watch it and was actually disappointed in it. I was expecting way more violence and things that would make me turn my head but instead got what seemed to be like an early version of Tokyo Gore Police. I do enjoy the gore and what not but not when it is so fake and obvious. I really was expecting something that would faze me in the slightest. Maybe I am just desensitized or extremely messed up. I would not buy this but I guess it was okay in general.~Joe,negative
"I'm not going to write a long essay and bore you when there's plenty of other readers comments posted.  I will say this though; there is nothing beautiful or artsy or thoughtful about this movie.  I will never understand why people try to make such crap out to be so pretty and creative.  I just don't understand.Now I've seen plenty of gory, violent movies, but this is tasteless.  I am so desensitized to violent films and even still I was offended.  My friend and I were anxious to see this film because of a little preview we saw on Japanorama, but it was very misleading.  A girl was watching the movie with us but she walked out deeply offended and I don't blame her.  There's tasteless violence and rape and sexual abuse in this movie and a very thin plot and totally detestable characters.  While I did laugh once, mostly it was just sick and wrong.  I wasn't shocked but I was offended.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.  Also, between the offensive scenes, this movie is painfully long and boring, so you'll be doing yourself a favor in more than one way if you avoid it like the plague.",negative
"**SPOILER** For many months now, I have been avidly searching for a copy of what is said to be the most extreme film by Takashi Miike, the anarchic film genius that has quickly become my favorite director. This morning, the copy I ordered finally arrived, and, when the 128 minutes of beauteous lunacy had passed, I was left feeling extremely saddened and disturbed, contrary to my expectations based on all of the reviews I read, which tauted the film as cartoonish and filled with comic violence that elicited disgusted chuckles rather than startled tears. Watching this movie, I knew that the violence was not real (obviously) so I did not judge the film based on the realistic nature of its violence or its ability to shock me (if I want to be shocked I will venture out into my ghetto neighborhood and witness an actual killing). I looked at the film from an artistic/philosophical standpoint, and viewed the representations of violence as tools to communicate the director's ideas. Here I what I found.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) Ichi the killer was, for me, a treatise on the cyclical nature of violence, the pointlessness (and subsequent anarchic devastation) of vengeance, the inevitability and consequences of human egoism and the complete lack of morality and ethics in a completely deterministic world. The protagonist, Kakihara, is a man on a mission to find his one true ""love,"" the only person able to satisfy him on a sexual/emotional/psychological (for Kakihara, one and the same)level. This kidnapped mob boss, he soon finds, has been murdered by the equivalent of a human robot, a very disturbed young man named Ichi who is manipulated and brainwashed by the director of what appears to be a halfway house for troubled youth (played with appropriate iciness by the director of the two ""Tetsuo"" films and ""Tokyo Fist"") into killing whoever the said director wants dead. Within this simple plot framework, ethics conflict with desires, the nature of abuse is explored, love and sexuality are perverted and questioned and everyone, it seems, fails in their simple quest to find happiness. Though there is no such thing as a happy ending for any involved (not even for Shinya Tsukamoto's subtle criminal mastermind), none are left as emotionally destroyed as Ichi, who's perspective of reality has been so intentionally skewed that this adolescent killing machine will never know peace. The majority of viewers will not look deeply enough into the film to appreciate its originality, audacity and style, and will probably write it off as just another ""Sick"" crime film, based on a comic book, made just to offend and entertain (how anyone can be purely entertained by this is beyond me). But to those with artistic minds who would not write the film off as just a live action manga (as so many have done to the brilliant ""Tetsuo""), to those who can look beneath the surface of a piece of art, please, please, please, BUY THIS FILM!!! You will learn from it.",negative
"""Ichi the Killer"" was an experience. I've never seen a movie like it. It's brutally gory, extremely suspenseful and filled with sociopathic characters who are impossible to sympathize with. Thats both why I liked the film and why I didn't like the film. This movie is like a rollercoaster ride through hell, but with its over 2 hour running time, there was only so much I could take before wanting to get off. Still, the performances from everyone were fantastic and the story itself becomes very interesting, especially at the end. If you think you can handle the huge amounts of gore and torture the movie throws at you, I think it's worth one watch.",positive
"The Yakuza, the Japanese crime syndicate, control crime on virtually every level of Japanese society. They bully the press and filmmakers to portray them as society's ""noble outlaws, when in reality they'll torture and/ or kill anyone who gets in their way. Japanese filmmaker Juzo Itami had a price on his head after he portrayed the Yakuza as money grubbing, ill mannered miscreants in the movie Minbo no oona. He was attacked by five members of the Yakuza in a parking lot outside his house and sustained serious injuries. (He allegedly committed suicide years later by jumping off a tall building.) With Koroshiya 1 (Ichi the Killer) Takashi Miike takes on the Yakuza in his own unique way.After the kidnapping, and possible brutal murder, of syndicate boss Anjo and the theft of 300 million yen Kakihara, Anjo's protégé and chief of his syndicate, seeks to find the party responsible. A masochist who will stop at nothing to prove a point, not even stopping short of cutting off part of his own tongue, Kakihara gets word that Suzuki, another crime boss, was involved due to Kakihara cutting him out of Anjo's porn video business. Anjo's syndicate is kicked out of the Yakuza, though, after Kakihara brutally tortures and disfigures Suzuki without proper proof that Suzuki was behind Anjo's disappearance. With Kakihara as their new leader, the clan finds out from a former member that Anjo is dead, murdered by a mysterious man known as Ichi who brutally hacks his victims to pieces. Missing the sadist to his masochist, Kakihara seeks Ichi out, the one person who may be able to give him the pain that he needs.Based on the manga of the same name by Hideo Yamamoto, Ichi the Killer is possibly one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. Miike shoots this very brutal movie with unmatched style using jump cuts, slick camera moves, and interesting angles to tell a story that otherwise would have just been near torture porn. The characters are also colorful, if also severely disturbing, especially Kakihara who sports a harlequin smile and purple jacket similar to Batman's Joker, but is scarier and far more unpredictable.Miike decides not to delve into the rights or wrongs of the Yakuza, and probably for the best after hearing the story of Juzo Itami, but instead takes a look at the brutality of the sadist/ masochist's relationship. But within this study of sadomasochism we still see the brutality of the Yakuza, even if its just amongst themselves and the different clans.The one problem I have with this is that at times the gore and ""action"" is a tad bit over the top. Of course, this could also be because the film was adapted from a manga, meaning that it's closer to the film form of anime than a live action feature. At times the over the top action, takes you out of the film, and causes the film to loose some sense of reality. These times pass by shortly after as you see the aftermath of what just happened which once again drops you back you into the devastating reality of the flick.All in all a great film, if gory and disturbing. If you have a weak stomach, or are adverse to gore I highly recommend that you stay away, and definitely don't allow the kids to watch. But this is a movie that will highly appeal to gore hounds, fans of torture porn, Asian film enthusiasts, and most people who enjoy a good organized crime movie. If you fall into those categories I highly recommend this flick.",positive
"You here it everywhere treat others how you want to be treated, David Lynch follows this philosophy and made a video recently spouting that same idealist utopian @#$%% proving he isn't intelligent one bit. My favorite writer and yes I have read the entire Manga series that inspired this film and was surprised how much Miike packed into a 2hr film what is a 20+ issue series, Hideo understands sick people do just that. He shows us the truth of our stupid pitiful sayings and definitions based on surface glance overs at the local scoff and go. Watch this film and the whole time think of every a hole who has ever spoken those nonsensical words, now every time some one says treat others how blah blah blah...I say unless they are a sadomasochist right? and puzzled looks is all I get from the western ideal peanut gallery that calls it self an intelligent species.",positive
"Ichi the Killer is a brutal yakuza movie by renowned director Takashi Miike. If you haven't watched any of his movies yet, let me tell you that this film isn't for lighthearted audiences. In the first five minutes alone, we see illegal gambling in a shady bar, a yakuza boss beating up and raping a prostitute and a voyeur masturbating to this instead of helping the poor woman. You will see prolonged torture sessions, people taking drugs and blood-red rooms filled with guts after intense massacres. Anyone who criticizes this movie for these elements or calls the viewers of it sick clearly didn't inform himself what kind of movie he was about to watch. Japanese yakuza movies are usually over-the-top, graphic and for mature audiences only. This is what makes them stand out.Ichi the Killer tells the story of a mentally unstable killer who seems to be manipulated via hypnosis and psychological torture by a lowly yakuza named Jijii who orders him to take out two rival yakuza gangs. Sadomasochistic hitman Kakihara wants to avenge his deceased boss but also desires meeting the killer in order to be domineered and tortured by him.If you think that this movie is only filled with perverted brutality, you've got it all wrong. The film features a lot of cultural elements related to yakuza traditions such as yubitsume, a ritual to atone for offenses by performing self-mutilation. The filming techniques are very experimental, working with unusual camera angles and stop-and-go technology. The authentic settings in form of dirty back alleys, small apartments and shady bars clash with flashy costumes as the sadomasochistic hitman walks around in colorful suits while the unstable killer wears a costume with special hidden weapons. The film works a lot with colors and their symbolism with white standing for the loss of childish innocence, black for darkness and red for violence. The experimental and vivid soundtrack blends in perfectly.The greatest element about this movie might be its stunning finale that actually offers some food for thought. It isn't immediately obvious what actually happens, how it occurs and what the consequences are. Personally, I believe Ichi the Killer, lowly yakuza Jijii and prostitute Karen are one and the same person with multiple-personality disorder since they share the same memories at times but there are many possible theories. No matter how you think about the film's outcome, it's something you will still be thinking about long after you have actually watched the movie.In the end, I can recommend the movie if you are equally interested in Japanese culture, brutal gangster films and intellectual film-making. Ichi the Killer stimulates your brain, your guts and your heart. It's an unforgettable experience based upon a unique manga and directed by one of the best directors of all times.",positive
"Wow- this film has it all- great acting, great story, tons of over-the-top violence...what more can you ask for? Takashi Miike is a brilliant director capable of handling many different styles of movies, and this is yet another of his masterpieces. The character of Kakihara is such a bad-ass, he ranks right up there with all the classic tough-guys of all time. There are definitely some brutal scenes, so ICHI may not appeal to mainstream movie goers, but if you like extreme action (think KILL BILL on crack, which this film obviously influenced), then I'm confident you will love ICHI. If this one does it for you- also check out FUDOH - another Miike extreme action masterpiece. Highly recommended - one of the best 9 1/2 out of 10",positive
"I'm a big fan of Korean, Japanese and Chinese movies. Their movies show content that you don't see in American movies or when they try to remake an Asian movie they change things up(they're not brave enough). This is a cool, disturbing and gory thriller. If your a fan of the genre watch this. If you want to watch something different watch this.",positive
Re-watched 'Ichi The Killer' and don't see why it shows up on so many lists of most disturbing films of all time. It's a beautiful art film that happens to have a lot of gore and violence.,positive
"Ichi the Killer (2001) ** 1/2 (out of 4) After hearing so much about this Takashi Miike film I must admit that I was really letdown. The biggest problem is the story, which I found very weak and the movie just kept going and going and going. The biggest ""hype"" surrounding the film was all the gore and violence. The film certainly delivered on that part but I didn't find any of it hard to watch because it was so fake looking. The man being split down the middle was probably the worst scene. Perhaps this is part of the charm but after hearing people say this was the hardest film they had to sit through, it didn't strike me as that. Both of the main characters are certainly among the most memorable from any film I've seen but in the end the movie didn't do too much for me.",negative
"This has got to be one of the best action (with some horror) movies ever. It has everything, brilliant acting, the incredible direction of Takashi Miike, and style. Plus, it has violence, sex, violent sex, sexual violence, and violent scenes of excess violence. Yes, lots of violence. With all the violence, it still manages to set itself apart from the mainstream slasher movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween (the crappiest serieses ever). If you haven't seen this movie yet, get it. It's available on eBay for about $12-$20 Buy it Now including shipping. To reiterate: this movie has excellent style. It's got extreme violence, but delivered in somewhat of a humorous fashion (not comedy, but still some comedic relief). For example, when someone is plunging to their death, rather than scream like a wuss, they yell ""WOW! This is great!"" Watch this movie now.",positive
"ITCHI The Killer was the title this film was shown at Toronto Film Festival, was preceded by a lot comments like `The most violent film of the festival'. I believe that honor was deserved by VERSUS, but this movie is something else.The story is amazing.  A mobster is seeking revenge on the dead of his boss, on the hands of a sadistic killer called ITCHIE (ONE). The problem is that the mobster is a sado-masochist in love with all the torture his dead boss infringed him and he is idealizing ITCHI as his new PAIN PARTNER (or probably lover).  So, for him this is not so a search for vengeance but for lost love.  On the other hand, ITCHI is mentally ill boy, being deceived and used by a couple of guys just making some money out of the killing for rent.Please, do not take this seriously, the movie is a BIG JOKE from the beginning to the end.  It is probably a little difficult to laugh when blood and organs are splattered everywhere, people are cut in half, necks are open with knifes and people are hanged by their backs skin (something like in THE CELL but less realistic).The movie is so ELECTRIC, that when it tones down for a few minutes it feels like boring, but is not. Unbelievably, I do not even realize, it also finds time to make you care for the characters (even with all their disturbing minds).CONFORT BAGS where delivered before the movie as part of the joke. Many people feel nervous about (I particularly had a heavy meal), but were absolutely unnecessary.  There is a line MIIKE (the director) never crosses. This is not `hardcore gore/pornography', this is an extreme (and very funny ) joke.",positive
"Somewhere in Tokyo, a sinister yakuza boss named ""Kakihara"" is searching for the one person who murdered his boss, he has a fetish to torture people with needles and anything else. An ex-cop named ""Jiji"" has a plan to take down the mafia, he is friends with an avenger named ""Ichi"" whom is an anti-hero with sharp blades that he can grow out in the back of his heels of his boots to literally slice people into pieces as he slaughters criminals, rapists, and has a job to destroy Kakihara.A jaw dropping, ultra-violent, action-packed and sleazy Japanese/Hong Kong/South Korean horror action thrill ride from top notch Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike ( of ""Audition"" fame). There is some good acting, decent special effects but the gore effects are quite realistic even in CGI and some scenes are hard to watch like Kakikhara's daily self mutilation and torturing his victims. This isn't a movie for everyone, but it's totally for those who want something different it is recommended but only if you can stomach it.Also recommended: ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"",""The New York Ripper"", ""Caligula"", ""House on The Edge of the Park"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Versus"", "" Cannibal Ferox"", "" Dead Alive ( a.k.a.

"I knew of the actor who plays the part of Ichi The Killer from another film called Fallen Angels where he also plays a killer connected to organized crime in Asia. Aside from that actors performance, the film is pretty much a dud and is also probably the grossest and bloodiest film I've ever seen in my entire life and that is really saying something. Typically bad acting is here aplenty-a thing that often mars Asian cinema in films like Old Boy and a number of other pseudo martial arts epics that have come out of Asia in the past decade or so. There isn't much special or even good about this movie-in many ways it is the personification of 'hack cinematography.' Nobody survives in the film or learns anything at all making it a real black journey in the true sense of the concept. Don't waste your time with this crap. In case you are interested the guy on the poster isn't 'Ichi The Killer'-he's is a crime lord of some type in the film who is being targeted by Ichi's rival organization.",negative
"i think it was the great author Hubert Selby Jr who said: ""only when we are consumed in darkness do we see the light"" Ichi the killer is a dark, strange and fascinating film especially if you are as entranced by cartoon violence as i, or Takashi Miike, the films twisted director are.what we have here, is a simplistic story about a mob boss who runs off with 300 million dollars and a broad, both of which are killed by a man named Ichi.meanwhile, the Coyote to Ichi's Roadrunner, a sadistic albino gangster named Kakihara goes on a hunt for his boss, the gangster who Ichi killed.thats all there really is too it, most of the films story is for the sake of progressing its black, horrid sense of humor, the point is to sicken the audience, and entrance it all at once.Ichi you see, is a superhero. a deadly killer who goes after the meanest of bullies, traumatized by a bad experience as a kid, he developed a penchant for killing those he was told deserved it, did i mention he has a rape fetish? yeah. he has a rape fetish.Kakihara is a total villain, he revels in blood and violence, he has what the guys at the Red Versus Blue cartoon would refer to as ""A Boner For Murder."" he gets off on not only the pain of others, but his own pain, he is fascinated by pain in all its forms, especially the pain his master gave him- the gangster who ichi kills. this drives him passionately to find ichi and take out vengeance.the remainder of the characters are really only important in the context of helping a Ichi and Kakihara move closer to their inevitable showdown, and thats fine, because the only two characters we are ever interested in are ichi and kakihara.if you are in any way squeamish, stay away. Ichi is not shy about its depraved violence. Miike has some issues, his twisted vision of ultra-violence makes for some gross stuff even in its most delicate moments. this film would never make it to American theaters, even with an NC 17 rating. however, its severed, bloody tongue is firmly in its cheek, treating its disgusting gore the same way we would treat an anvil falling on the Coyote's head. perhaps thats a broad social statement, perhaps Miike is just too messed up in the head to know the difference between goofy getting hit on the head with a mallet, and a mans penis being severed with a pair of safety scissors, either way, this is a great film if you have the stomach for it. but if you don't, well then you're roger ebert and there is a Disney movie somewhere you could be watching right now.",positive
"If you wanna know where Tarantino took his inspiration from, you must watch movies like these. Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the killer"" is the kind of movie that is a kick against the heads from all those who think movies must have some moral stories to make this world any better as this movie is disgusting. The whole movie they are in search of Ichi, a serial killer who got pestered at his schooldays and now he seek his time for vengeance. Everything goes wrong when he kills some yakuza-boss and got haunted by the butcher of the gang he was president of. Every scene contains some extremely violence that will put off some of the viewers (what about a tongue that's been cut in two?, it's just an example as every scene has its own sick imagination) and you can't help thinking of ""Kill Bill"". Beyond all human taste perhaps, but I enjoyed it a lot nontheless.",positive
"Overall, Ichi The Killer is a long and tedious film, the movie would have received a lower score if it was not for its extremely unique plot, which I loved. Though it is a bit grotesque and unusual, it was something that seemed right up my alley (I enjoy high concept horror movies). The main character is as bizarre as they come, which is great, if it weren't for Kakihara, the movie would have been flat out terrible. His growing excitement towards Ichi is great, the more he gets anxious and excited, the more we are pulled in as a viewer. But a film with so much potential is squandered by the disappointing character known as Ichi, he is so over the top that it completely ruins the character. I hated everything about his character, from the actor who plays him, to his excessive jitteriness, and to his convoluted past. This is where the movie lost me as a viewer, so much relied on this character and I couldn't buy into it. Before the two characters meet, we are given glimpses of Ichi and for me, they were nothing but disappointing. And as the for the climax where they finally meet, I should have known the movie would throw a curveball (it is Miike after all). But what you can say about the movie is that Miike has a very unique style, which is bittersweet, I can appreciate and admire it, but I don't always enjoy it (like the case with Ichi the Killer).",negative
"OK, I really cant understand how this film is voted a 7. I give it a 3. The ending is utter crap and ridiculous and incomprehensible. I've heard the director's commentary and read an article about it, and NO ONE knows what the ending means, not Takashii Miike, no one. Its stupid.Its necessary for me to say I saw the cut R-Rated US version, I couldn't find it uncut. I wish I did, because was this supposed to be filled with gore and blood? Was I supposed to be disturbed? Better try harder, or get more uncut copies. I was not impressed with the R cut at all, but the movie was such crap I don't think I'd watch the uncut. Maybe i'd jump right to the kills or something.Ichi himself is a whining baby and a letdown. Kakatari or whatever was kinda cool at the beginning, but by the end this movie was yawntastic. I really need someone to show me some uncut stuff or otherwise this movie has nothing going for it. I'd like to see what the fuss is about, but the storyline is weak and not the easiest to follow. They try to sow meaning and a lesson of some sort into the fabric of the story, but fail. I did not enjoy this film and I watch a lot of movies and love gore and crazy stuff.Not impressed. Maybe I'll post again if I see the uncut stuff, but i doubt my feelings on the story and plot will change.",negative
"I'll admit that I walked into Ichi the Killer with high expectations. I had heard nothing but praise for the movie from day one, and in fact, though I hadn't seen it, it's what turned me on to Takashi Miike in the first place. Before Ichi, I had seen Gozu, Happiness of the Katakuris, all three Dead or Alives and Visitor Q. Ichi is a bit of a letdown.First off, if you've heard about the intense amount of gore and violence in the movie, you've heard right. The violence is almost nonstop, and the scenes oftorture and rape are really hard to stomach. I personally am OK with violence for the most part, but Ichi just pushes the limit for me.I guess every great director has one movie that I find to be totally overrated... Fellini had La Dolce Vita, Scorsese has Raging Bull, heck even Kurosawa hadthe way-overrated Rashomon, and I guess Miike's got Ichi the Killer.The plot rolls in very, very, verrrrrrrry slowly, letting the action take the driver's seat for most of the movie. However, once the plot does enter, it's prettyinteresting. Ichi is a very well developed character, as is Kakihara. I also can't say that I didn't enjoy the fight scenes, but I would have enjoyed them more if I didn't have to keep from puking.The score is probably the only score I've heard with a drum solo (besides Taxi Driver, I guess), and it's not bad at all. It's nothing like Koji Endo's stuff (he's the guy that usually collaborates with Miike), but it's kind of exhilarating. And just like all of Miike's movies, you are bound to find something that you will feel bad laughing about.The Final Cut:Direction: BNot in any way up to Miike's usual technique. The sped-up sequences felt out of place.Script: BIt's alright, but Sakichi Sato has again, done better...Style: BIt's like Miike with more violence than one can usually handle. Add or subtract from the score depending on how you feel about that.Acting: A-Everyone's just fine, but the guy that plays Ichi is absolutely perfect. He's so innocent... and then he slices a pimp in half. BAHAHA!!!Music: A-Not what I expected, but it works.Overall: BOverrated, but still a ton of fun, definitely the most violent movie I've ever seen.",positive
"Takashi Miike is never far from the centre of controversy. ""Audition"" (1999), is a fantastic movie and one of the best horror movies Japan has to offer. It's only nature that Miike would return to his roots with the yakuza genre sooner or later, but who knew it would be this intense?Based on Hideo Yamamoto's manga series. ""Ichi The Killer"" tells the story of rival yakuza gangs and the involvement of a scarred and psychologically damaged man, Ichi, who is manipulated into assaulting or killing rival faction members. Leading to sadomasochistic yakuza enforcer Kakihara, to eagerly await a final showdown with this supposed ""dangerous"" individual.Without really spoiling anything, the title credits set the tone for this movie by literally appearing in Ichi's ejaculation. So there clearly is a level of taste in this film that may or may not be for you, the film is outright banned in several locations because of this. I've seen it once and its shock value does overwhelm its pacing in many areas, with the final 40 minutes becoming much clearer when following the narrative. Music-wise the soundtrack is pretty great and either way the movie is a mess in terms of gore and story telling, yet there is something surprisingly engrossing where certain events take you. Maybe I missed a lot the first time viewing and it runs a little too long for its own good, but I really found myself enjoying it and inevitably eager to see it again.Final Verdict: In essence, ""Ichi The Killer"" is pretty forgetful when considering Takashi's other works. But if you're a fan of his then I highly recommend it. 7/10.",positive
"Being a fan of director Takashi Miike, I have to say that his films differ immensely in quality in my opinion. While his masterpiece ""Audition"" of 1999 is one of the few truly brilliant Horror films of the 90s, other films such as ""Izo"" of 2004 disappointed me. ""Koroshiya 1"" aka ""Ichi The Killer"" of 2001 is probably Miike's most famous film, but, as far as I am concerned, not nearly one of his best. It is certainly no bad film. On the contrary, ""Ichi The Killer"" has many ingenious elements, and it is a highly entertaining film that is especially recommendable to fans of the truly gory stuff. Yet the film has many flaws. Miike's specific style is always unconventional, but sometimes it works perfectly (such as in ""Audition"") and sometimes it doesn't work so well. ""Ichi"" is a weird and intense film, but it is also quite messy at times.Yakuza boss Anju disappears with a large sum of money. Since his henchmen suspect that he has been kidnapped, they go out to search for him, lead by the sadomasochistic Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), a killer who enjoys to torture as much as he enjoys to feel pain himself. Then there is also Ichi (Nao Omori), a psychotic, young man who, while usually whiny and meaning no harm, has a tendency for slaughtering everybody around once he's flipping out...""Ichi The Killer"" is most widely known for being one of the most ultra-violent films of the recent years. And Takashi Miike is a filmmaker who truly understands how to make his viewers feel the on-screen violence. The on gore in ""Ichi The Killer"" is not only nauseating. It sometimes hurts. Then again, the film's comic-book style mood make it a lot less shocking. While the ultra-violent ""Audition"" was not quite as excessive as this film, it was incomparably more shocking and disturbing than ""Ichi"". The film's weird narrative style may be seen as a quality or as a flaw, depending on one's point of view. I tend to see it positively, and yet some other Miike films have so much more to offer. The performances are quite good. Tadanobu Asano is very convincing (and quite scary) in the role of Kakihara, the sadomasochistic torture-enthusiast with a cut-up face. Nao Omori is very weird in the role of the... VERY WEIRD Ichi. I am not sure whether his performance is praiseworthy or the opposite. He seems quite unstable, that's for sure. The supporting cast includes a whole bunch of notable Japanese actors, most prominently Sumusu Terajima (""Hana-Bi"", ""Violent Cop"", ""Brother""), who is credited as ""Sabu"" here, and Jun Kunimura (""Audition"", ""Kill Bill Vol. 1""). Visually, the film is great, not only in its gory aspects. ""Ichi The Killer"" is the most famous film by Takashi Miike. It is not nearly his best, and it has its flaws but it is still an interesting film that I recommend to my fellow fans of Japanese cinema, especially those who like it violent.",negative
"This movie has had a lot of good praise but is equalled with negative feedback too. I don't see why people have quarrels with the film. I couldn't believe what I was watching when I saw it for the first time and I was sitting drooling for more and more each time someone was killed. I've noticed a lot of people have categorised this movie as comedy'. I disagree, how can you class a violent, gory, brutal film as comical? It was funny yes, but funny in the sense that leaves you thinking `what the hell just happened?' and `ok that's not right.' The deaths and murders are fantastic and really opened my mind to what the cinema actually allows these days. I would love to have seen this in the cinema in England, it would have been banned instantly, and people would have probably puked their brains out.The film does tend to make you think that the character Kakihara is `Ichi the Killer' but in fact Ichi turns out to be some twisted little creep who takes revenge on `bullies' in society by killing them in the most horrific way. Kakihara is a gang member and is on the trail to find his missing boss by any means necessary. Insane torture scenes and self-mutilation are just a few of the graphical feasts surrounding Kakihara.",positive
"Being a semi-hardcore fan of Miike's work, and this being the only of his films I haven't seen, I was expecting a masterpiece. What I actually got, on the other hand, was a very good movie that was a little . . . average, in some places, that is.First and foremost, the charters are the single reason to watch Ichi the Killer. Ichi the Killer is very reminiscent of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, being that the plot isn't very good, but the characters sell the story to near perfection. Both Ichi and Kakihara are sadistic killers, and both have to be two of the most memorable killers I've ever seen in a movie. There is also pure genius in having Ichi's name in the title but mainly focusing the runtime on Kakihara. Every secondary character is fleshed out, and have some of the funniest lines in all Asian cinema. There is not a single character in Ichi the Killer that is a cliché, and every one of them is very, very memorable.The plot, on the other hand, is just a little average. Two gangs, boss missing, beat up girlfriend. Even here, however, Miike inserts a bit of genius by adding paradoxical black comedy and some minor twists that certainly add some much-needed originality to the rather bland initial storyline. In other words, the story starts out sucky, then gets a lot better by the end as it gets more linear.The main problem I have with most Asian cinema is the low production value, but Ichi the Killer stays pretty average-production throughout. It never once sinks as laughably low-budget as Audition, but still isn't up to par with the even the tail-end of American cinema. Miike's directing fixes that. To be blunt, he does things with a camera I simply never knew could be done. He goes out of his way to make sure his characters wear/do/say/are in some of the most random situations as they deliver the boring exposition that is needed for the (somewhat dull) complex plot line. The music in the background is never once predictable (as with most horror movies), and some of it is just downright AWESOME. I can't begin to describe the technical brilliance of Miike's directing hereit's BY FAR the best work he's ever done.The bad: I was told by countless people and read countless reviews that this is one ofif not THEgoriest movie of all times. That is a downright lie. I watched the unrated, uncut version of Ichi the Killer. The torture scenes in Ichi the Killer look downright tame compared to the Saw franchise, because Miike never keeps the camera focused on the gore. Everything is a cut-off scene, like in kid's movies. The overall over-the-top gore is nothing newKill Bill had more, I think. And video games like No More Heroes have a lot more. The violence/gore is just downright average. Some scenes are pretty sick, but nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to the uncut versions of American torture films like Saw III. When the camera cuts away without showing gore to let my ""imagination take over"", it's a downright cop-out. There is nothing truly gory here, and that majorly disappointed me.Also, it needed to be tightened up by 15 minutes or so. There wasn't a single scene that just outright bored me, but Ichi the Killer was overall just way too long. Some of the talking scenes were unnecessary and redundant.Overall, though, Ichi the Killer is probably one of the best Asian action-horror movies out there. It's a must-see for any horror/action fan. And did I mention it's a great use of primary colors? 7/10",positive
"It has been a while since I watched this movie, used to have it on DVD, but didn't know what to think of it. Anyway just bought it again, unrated this time. Anybody familiar with Takashi Miike's work should not be surprised by this movie, it is his usual shocking, gruesome and controversial movie, that delivers on violence gore and just been plain weird. This was the first movie I watched by Takashi Miike's, Maybe that's why I didn't know what to think of it at first. Ichi the killer is a great movie if you know what to expect, it's got a good, but weird story, that focuses on a psychopathic yakuza member, looking for his boss and a very disturbed and misled serial killer that goes around in a black sort of suit, with blades on the heels that he uses to slice people in to pieces. All in all it is a violent, disturbing gory gore fest of a movie with a story about a psychopathic, sadistic yakuza member, who likes to inflict pain and also receive it, and a serial killer who is just plain weird. I rate this movie 10/10 for weirdness and entertainment.",positive
"ICHI is a vividly realized manga from the uneven Miike and it's recommended.The gore will not offend many as its over-the-top, but the film's two scenes of sexual violence may upset most people. As action scenes, these sequences possess a kinetic energy and shock factor that you won't see in many films outside the U.S. The film's plot is complex and the characterizations are very sharp. The editing style is highly original with continuity cuts between scenes taking place over several years. It's a little confusing on first viewing, but there's a lot more to ICHI than some reviews would suggest.The film's sound design and score are also riveting, as are the central performances and a terrific guest turn by Shinya Tsukamoto.Certainly one of Miike's best films alongside VISITOR Q and GOZU.",negative
"###MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS###Takeshi Miike is quickly becoming one of the most prolific directors in Asia. Alongside the likes of Takeshi Kitano(Sonatine) and Kenji Fukasaku(Battle royale) He is rewriting the rules of cinema worldwide. Throughout ichi the killer Miike uses disgusting effects and a mixture of swish camera techniques and vivid colours which make the fantasy world of ichi even more depraved. A stunning array of perverse or weird characters can be found throughout ichi the killer.Most notably Kakihara. Possibly the single most stylish character in the history of cinema. He is a complete sado-mosochist. Who seeks ichi in his quest for the ultimate pain experience. Donning a purple suit, blonde hair and pierced cheeks, he is simply unforgettable.Then theirs ichi. A totally depraved screwball who has been brainwashed. He enjoys seeing women get raped. Here Miike has created yet another superb character. Ichi is psychologically disturbed and very multi layered. A clever character by all means, whose personality runs much deeper than just committing senseless violence.Talking of violence this is chock full of it. Some scenes of rape are highly disturbing. Whilst others are almost comedic in the representation of manga style gore which is innovative and cool looking. This is another thing about ichi. It has the ability to be disturbingly hilarious. You really will wonder why your smiling at times. One example of this is when Kakihara is torturing somebody hung on spikes. the boss comes in and says something like, ""What the hells going on here?"" Kakihara replies, ""Just a little torture."" Its just unbelievable how sick this scene is, yet still somehow manages to display a gunmetal black sense of humour.Even though Kakihara is such a horrid sadistic kind of guy, you can't help but enjoy his screen presence. He is just so ultra cool and relaxed.I'm not going to give any more of the plot away, you really must see this movie. It is excruciatingly good. In fact its such a masterpiece that it saddens me that this is probably a one of a kind movie experience. A completely unique yakuza, horror comedy. Tremendous.",positive
"Once again somebody simply didn't get the great Miike. This movie isn't about being ""cool"" or ""stupid"" or whatever. It is all about it's story and characters. Perhaps the violence and extremities blind you, but everything is completely motivated. Kakihara has a drive and passion (love?) for violence which is why the movie is as it is, whenever he is on the screen. The entire film is actually subjectively distorted through the eyes of (at least) 3 characters. So how can you criticize a movie this complex, with this many layers, for being to stupid? Simple, because you didn't get it. The thing that makes this movie truly great is that it appears to be a simple and stupid gore-comedy, and in fact it is so much more.10/10",positive
"but man it was awesome. The movie is filled with many charismatic characters... and the ending is amazing... although it may be a bit confusing when watching the first time... What I have noticed is that Park Chan Ook's 'Old Boy' ""borrowed"" a couple of scenes from this movie: tongue-cutting scene, needle-in-the-ear scene, etc... I have not seen the Manga on which this movie is based, but maybe 'Old Boy' was based off the same Manga. Apparently though, Miike and Park are acquainted. They released the 'Three Extremes' (I believe last year) which featured three movies, one from each Park and Miike and another Asian director.Anyway, I do not recommend this movie to people who cannot stomach gore... but I do think that all the violence and gore in this movie don't seem real. They're so over-the-top that I can't really feel the pain when the characters are being tortured or inflicting pain on themselves... Audition was much harder to stomach... for me anyways... Miike's one of best! Must see... (but again, not for everyone)",positive
"This has to be one of the most twisted flicks I've ever seen. It's full of explicit violence, rape, torture, and sado-masochism. That being said, I FRICKING LOVED IT. The plot is that Kakihara, a Yakuza enforcer, is searching for his boss who is missing with a large sum of money. Kakihara's appearance is a little unusual (he's got numerous scars on his face and his mouth is enlarged by two slits in his cheeks that he keeps together with piercings). Kakihara is a total nut case who gets off only on pain (his own or others) who is torturing his way to what happened to his boss. Ichi is a very disturbed young man who is being forced to go out and kill by his controller (I won't mention who it is). Kakihara is interested in finding Ichi and will do pretty much anything to get to him.There's more violence in here than you can shake a stick at. Kakihara sticks needles through a guy's cheeks (who is hanging from the ceiling by hooks) and then pours boiling oil on the poor schmuck. Later, Kakihara cuts the tip of his own tongue off. Later still, they cut off a woman's nipples. These are just a few examples of some of the really twisted stuff that happens in this movie. Director Takashi Miike really out did himself on this one. I hope he keeps putting out flicks like this.",positive
"There's no depth to be found here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Kill Bill, for example, was quite successful despite the fact that it didn't feature any kind of depth. Ichi the Killer, like Kill Bill celebrates it's extreme, but shallow or perhaps static characters.Ichi is interesting, but the blond masochistic yakuza guy steals the show. His character makes the film's extreme violence interesting rather than gratuitous. It's not difficult to watch in the way that sympathy for mr.vengeance is because you don't particularly care about any of the characters. On the other hand, the extreme violence, particularly the amount levied at women, certainly causes some thought. Even the most normal of characters in the film, the retired policeman, exhibits very disturbing sociopathic tendencies when it comes to women. Does this reflect contemporary Japanese culture? In any case, this film is certainly worth watching if you can stomach the surrealist violence and are up for a serious change of pace.",positive
"Not a good movie at all, and to say it is, is childish!. This is a man child movie. Not really funny to see people killed this way in the movie, and the comedy is just stupid, not really funny. To see people rate this high, must be mostly Japanese or just stupid Americans. I watched this and the only thing that is good to me is the gore. Everything else just makes me want to turn it off. Captions, for being from another country, is annoying to read like a book, instead of watching, and main character just acts stupid, which is not really funny at all. More annoying to watch, than to enjoy the killing and gore. So, this is a NO to enjoy movie, and not enjoyable at all.",negative
"Alright, the opening scenes were awesome, when you first see Kakihara and he is blowing his cigarette smoke out of the hole in his cheeks... that has hardcore.Unfortunately that was the absolute highlight of this film. I should clarify before continuing that I love Japanese cinema, and that violence is no problem for me (original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of my faves), however the violence in this movie is unrealistic, unsatisfying, and unnecessary. Victims bodies shred and break as though they were made of Styrofoam. Bodies shoot arterial sprays by the tens of gallons. Guts spill hundreds of feet of intestines. Obviously Miike has a deep misunderstanding of anatomy.The plot, pacing, dialog, and editing of this movie are even more mangled than Ichi's victims. I rarely had any understand of what is going on or why. The Character were inexpressive, hollow, cartoons. The cast of this movie left me longing for a Vin Diesel caliber performance. Not recommended unless you enjoy cinematic cerebral palsy.",negative
"So you get movies like Old Boy, Lady Vengeance, I Saw the Devil, Battle Royale, Kill Bill, The Raid, Man from Nowhere, and a seemingly endless list of classic Asian gory thrillers. And then people come to Ichi the Killer (operative word *""Killer""*) and they cry, ""too much violence?"" That's like going to a porn and saying, ""too much sex."" Maybe I'm 10 yrs too late to defend this classic, but this move served its purpose. First of all, it's an adaptation of a manga/comic book magazine series. They're laced with violence and sexuality. Sin City was rather similar in concept I feel, just much more boring and timid.Look anywhere...ask anyone...what is your issue with ""Ichi"" and hardly anyone says, ""it was a bad film, didn't make any sense, boring, stupid, vapid, badly shot, badly acted, badly written, badly produced."" The main if not sole issue here is, ""too violent."" Well that's a given. That's like going to a horror film and saying ""too scary."" Haha.Anyway, this film is a perfect muse for anyone who wants to do manga, gore, or write erotic horror stories, like myself. Why not? The violence wasn't even scary or disturbing, I could barely flinch or gag because it was, to me, so over the top that I was silenced in awe at the make-up effects and the style and sense of humor of the actor playing infamous torturer Kakihara, more than anything else. I easily followed the story, I didn't have to rewind at all, and I was excited and curious as it went along. I'm now also kind of inspired.The violence also wasn't gratuitous or in vain. There was a purpose for it. When you have a hero/anti-hero, or a likable villain, and they have a pronounced rival, throughout the course of the film you have to understand what the protagonist and antagonist are up against.Since the film is really about the ultimate showdown between the most psychotic, sadomasochistic yakuza around (Kakihara) vs the brutal alter ego of a pathetically shy hikikomori/recluse (Ichi), you have to see how violent both are meantime to anticipate the victory of one or the other. Because Kakihara is yakuza, and scary to even tough thugs and kingpins, you first have to see how Ichi and his mentor get through them. You won't be wowed by the last battle if you never really got to learn how brutal the main fighters are in the first place. Hence the violence. It's not over the top at all if you have brain cells.The visuals are also very nice. It doesn't really look like the colors were saturated as much as it looks like the crew just cherrypicked the colors to use for the scenery, lights, interior, clothes, hair... So it does look very much like a manga come to life. The acting was phenomenal, even the kids in it, and the supporting background actors (yakuza terrified by Kakihara) were great, they understood their parts and what Miike wanted of them. I'm not a fan of Takashi Miike, his films are overrated and even boring as hell but this one I don't quite understand any flak.",positive
"quite simply the most violent film that i have ever seen with a collection of torture scenes in which i really did have to avert my eyes from the screens because they really were that excruciating.but that does not make it a good film though. anybody that has read all of the comments on this film will have noticed that everyone (and this obviously includes me) talks almost completely about the violence and nothing else. and this may well be because there is not an awful lot else to talk about. the story (derived from a manga) is wafer thin as is the characterisation but then, lets be fair, this is just a splatter film.the CGI assisted violence is well done but, to me, the violence at times went well past the black humor threshold and was just plain unpleasant. i do happen to think that Miike is a talented guy (go see Audition which uses violence effectively) as a couple of sequences show. the start is incredibly visual and kinetic and the sequence where we learn all about how the cop ended up in the yakuza is really well done. but any soft touches are lost under a welter of blood and guts. he also handled very well the often uncomfortable link between sex and violence although at times it did really feel like a boys movie gone mad with the depiction of women.so if you are not easily offended and like your films violent then sure, go and see it. on the other hand if you actually like your films to have a message, meaning or story then just dont. nice use of fish hooks though...",negative
"This 2001 movie is a typical Takashi Miike movie. Now that may sound like a bad thing, but trust me, it is not. Takashi Miike is a very gifted Japanese director with an eye for the absurd and outrageous.And ""Ichi the Killer"" (aka ""Koroshiya 1"") is indeed a strange movie, especially if you are not familiar with Japanese cinema and the works of Takashi Miike.The story is about a sadomasochistic Yakuza enforcer who is looking for missing boss. He happens to cross paths with Ichi, a troubled young man and a ruthless killer.Tadanobu Asano (playing Kakihara) really were memorable in ""Ichi the Killer"", and the make-up on his face was really interesting and left a lasting impression. And Nao Ômori (playing Ichi) was also memorable in the role of the psychotic killer. And Paulyn Sun (playing Karen) did bring a touch of odd charms to the movie in her role.What works for ""Ichi the Killer"" is the weird ensemble of odd and off-beat characters who were portrayed throughout the movie. And director Takashi Miike is really adept at coming up with such memorable characters, and it is what makes his movie so interesting.The story is very easy to follow, but does have some deeper layers and director Takashi Miike is skilled at presenting such story lines and manages to connect the dots and tie up all loose ends masterfully.All in all a very enjoyable and watchable movie. A movie that even sustains more than a single viewing.",negative
"""Ichi the Killer"" is perhaps Takeshi Miike's best-known work. Telling the tale of rival Yakuza gangs, it features Ichi, a mentally-unstable young man who has a very violent method of killing his victims. When different mob families come facing off against each other, what happens when Ichi gets caught in the middle? ""Ichi"" was not what I expected. While there's clearly plenty of violence, blood and gore... it's not, in my opinion, one of Miike's best works in the gore department. I personally found ""Audition"" and ""Izo"" to be more engaging stories and ""Visitor Q"" to be more extreme in its presentation. For those who became exposed to Miike through ""Imprint"", this will not shock them, most likely.If I had to compare ""Ichi"" to anything, it is more along the lines of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch"" than a slasher film. The rival gangs are far more interesting than Ichi, who doesn't even make an appearance for a significant period of time. The film's protagonist is not Ichi at all, but another man named Kakihara, who may be more brutal and certainly a snappier dresser. Ichi kills, but this man tortures.If you want action, this won't be the film you're looking for. Over the two hours of running time, much of it is a complex plot that requires reflection and strict attention. Keeping characters straight is problematic for first time viewers, and the plot isn't really straight-forward. Calling the film ""Ichi the Killer"" is a bit misleading, as he is hardly the focus. A fantastic film to be sure, but for my money, not the best Miike has to offer.",positive
"There are some Miike films I love (Audition—brilliant!, Dead or Alive—wild!, Fudoh—so messed up!). There are some Miike films I hate (Gozu, Dead or Alive 2—both boring). And then there are those Miike films that are so eccentric, both thematically and in their execution, that I find it hard to decide exactly how I feel about them. Ichi the Killer falls into this last category: based on a manga comic, it features all of the Miike trademarks that I usually enjoy—crazy characters, daring camera-work, erratic editing, and lots of extreme gore—but the storytelling is so off-kilter that I was left reeling in confusion, and feeling just a little bit disappointed.The basic plot goes something like this After a Yakuza boss is sliced up by a mysterious killer, slit-mouthed gang member Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) vows to find the man responsible—a psychotic loner called Ichi, who can only achieve orgasm while watching or committing acts of extreme violence (he's so pathetic that his photo doesn't even make it on to the DVD cover). Kakihara, an extreme sadomasochist, becomes obsessed with the idea of Ichi being the ultimate giver of pain, but when he comes face to face with the man, he finds that the reality doesn't live up to his expectations.That's the general gist of the film, but there's so much more that I cannot adequately explain thanks to Miike's non-conformist approach which makes the narrative so difficult to comprehend. Suffice to say that the film is consistently bonkers— a demented tale of revenge and obsession drenched in bodily fluids (some of which is real, according to the director. Yuck!). Weird/outrageous highlights include several really messy throat slashings (arterial spray galore!), a man cut in half and another guy's severed face sliding down a wall (both achieved via some iffy CGI), a 'human bloodhound' who can locate a man by sniffing a woman's crotch, lots of sadomasochistic violence, and a smidge of eye-watering nipple slicing. Reasonably fun, I suppose, but I wish it was less of a struggle for me to follow.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",negative
Ichi the killer aka Koroshiya 1 is a violent and nasty of film of course. Im use to it because its a Takashi Miike flim. It base on a violent manga by Hideo Yamamoto.IF you never heard of takashi miike before well you have to watch one of his films to find out. Im a very big fan of Miike and I really enjoyed his work. In my opinion Miike has to be the strangest and wildest director i ever witness.  If you  seen Audition another masterpiece from Miike you will know that his upcoming film will be violent. He makes like 6 flim per year. Thats truly amazing.Now lets talk about ichi the  killer.I really enjoyed this film because it show me alot about the charaters mainly about ichi and kakihara who is played by Asano Tadanobu a total badass . Kakihara is a voilent man who wants to endure alot of pain as you can tell by  looking at his scared up face.  And he a special ability to smoke that doesnt come out of his mouth or nose witch he invented himself by slicing a part of his face. He nobody to mess with .  Now comes ichi a loner who likes to crie and has violent pass as a child (i dont want to give too much information away) so buy the dvd.  I recommended this movie for those want to see something different from hollywood.Well Miike never let me down so im going to give this 10 out of 10.,positive
"I can't imagine this film holding much genuine appeal for anyone other than true psychopaths. I hate to put people down, but I think most people who claim to like this movie are just spouting pseudo-intellectual nonsense to raise themselves above ""normal"" filmgoers, who wouldn't touch this with a ten-foot pole. Parts of the film are enjoyable, but much of it is plodding, and the extreme sadism of certain parts of it far outweigh any enjoyable or valuable elements the film might have. You can make a movie exploring the seamy and sadistic underbelly of Japan (and frankly, I think it's a stretch to say that ""Ichi"" really succeeds in telling us anything about the psychology of violence) without showing tongues and nipples cut off. I have appreciated some of Takashi Miike's past jokes on audiences, but here he's just made a film so unpleasant that I have a hard time believing that any normal person could truthfully say ""I enjoyed that."" I suspect that would please him. I wish, though, that he would return to making films like ""Dead or Alive"" that leave the audience bewildered but not completely repulsed.",negative
"I caught the full uncut version of Takeshi Miike's incredible Ichi the Killer at a film festival in Leeds and was absolutely blown away.  It totally lived up to all the hype, and if you can get over the horrifically graphic violence you are in for an absolute treat !!Never has feeling so bad felt so good.  The plot is pretty convoluted, and the film improves massively after more viewings.  This film is not just a straight forward slasher as many critics have said - it grabs you from many different angles and keeps the brain ticking away throughout.  One minute you're laughing your head off, and the next you're trying your hardest not to look away.  Then two minutes later you're deep in thought giving both the main leads a good psychological going over.  It also leaves you thinking after the credits roll - both about the general intertwining character plotlines, and the questions raised by the last few scenes.
Whilst there are people out there who will absolutely hate this film and find themselves trying not to vomit, those of you who can take some comic book violence and have a slightly darker sense of humour are in for an absolute treat. Ichi truly is Number 1 !!!",positive
"If you have never heard about Takashi Miike, that's the best opportunity to begin, and probably finish, with this one. Totally bloody, crazy, exciting, disgusting, not for all audiences, between black comedy and crime, horror and drama, it is really difficult to analyse or out it in a category. Some unbearable scenes, not for the squeamish. A story very hard to follow and telling, many sub characters and plots too. Nothing to do with any kind of movie genre in particular.",positive
"""Ichi the Killer"" cycled between being weird and incomprehensible to focused and lucid. Weird can be good sometimes, but most often weird is not. The weirdness in ""Ichi the Killer"" was not good.There was a lot of bloodshed. I mean a lot. Gallons of fake blood were used for this movie. They had to use gallons of blood just to do their anime style blood gushing. You know the gushing I'm talking about--those scenes when an artery is cut and blood sprays out like it's under high pressure.Ichi was a strange killer. I say strange because he was rather basic guy, but once he got the proper coaxing he was an efficient, albeit messy, killer. The plot wasn't all that complicated and it's not worth mentioning. The Anjo gang was looking for their missing boss and Ichi was being programmed to kill them. It was bloody, borderline pornographic at times, and weird.",negative
"One thing is for sure, people who don't like to see blood should stay away from Miike's latest movie ""Ichi the Killer"" or ""Koroshiya 1"". Even is the movie lasts about more than 150 minutes, it is full-time action with the most unbelivable Horror and fighting tricks and moves ever. Miike uses amazing gadgets just to provoque blood, and the best thing is: his cameras are always centered on the action, meaning that you see all details possible. The story, of course, is non-sense and complex, but still, the evoultion and the revenge of this Ichi is interesting to experience. You really see how far the humans might go, simply to hunt somebody down and to take a horrible revenge. Koroshiya 1 is a movie with excellent entertainment and considerable acting performances. One more tip: Seeing this movie is unique, so if you get the chance, go watch it!!!(Franck Tabouring - Worldcinema.lu)",positive
"Ichi the Killer is essentially comic book perversion.The main character Kakihara makes it somewhat watchable and at times slightly amusing, but the story and character of Ichi ridiculous and childish, as well as most of the others involved. The effects are also mixed with supernatural elements, making it actually less gory and just silly.",negative
"I found this movie to be quite enjoyable and very funny.  Overall, the level of violence and shock serve as a wonderful way to test your own sensibilites.  The style of this movie is quite unique both visually and in structure.  Truly, this is one of the best films ever created.  But how could something so uncompromisingly pointless and meaningless be so great?Ichi the Killer is an expression of our deepest inner desires.  As a race, man has always been violent and self absorbed.  In the spirit of Kakihara, what better way is there to have fun then to stick needles into the face of someone you don't like?  Who doesn't enjoy a good throat slashing and intestine spilling once in awhile?  All of the kills that you actually see Ichi commit are all throat slashes accompanied by a nice fountain of blood. He then stands in ecstasy as the blood sprays on his face.  The truth is, we all wish we were there, standing in that fountain of blood.  It is merely in our nature to destroy.Addition to some minor violence, sexual anxieties play a large role in this movie.  Sex and violence oftentimes go hand in hand, as they are both primal and natural instincts.  Sadomasochism is ofentimes looked down upon as some sort of perverted hobby, but pretty much everyone has a deep seated desire to feel pleasure and pain at the same time.  This film brings to light all these inherent human conditions whether or not the viewer is prepared to see them or not.  Some choose to look away and call this film crap.  But in reality, they are only scared of what they see in themselves.  This film serves as a higher form of entertainment that brings both fun (the ""infamous"" tongue cutting scene is quite enjoyable) and art (such as the ending that makes absolutely no sense) together.  Miike is a genius pure and simple.  Ichi the Killer is a masterpiece that everyone should see.",positive
"I have to say I really enjoyed this film. But for the record, the guy on the front is not Ichi.One day, boss Anjo of the Anjo gang goes missing with 100 million yen, and his chief henchman, Kakihara, is determined to solve this mystery. The one thing we do know is that the violence behind the massacre is caused by Ichi, a painfully shy and sexually repressed yet psychotic mad man, who is constantly on the verge of mentally snapping He is the trademark card of Jijii, played by Shinya Tsukamoto, who is an ex-cop and a genius. He is, for ambiguous reasons (money?) determined to turn all of the gangsters in Japan against one another, until the streets run red with blood. It's a little bit like Japanese Pulp Fiction (but Pulp Fiction would make a mockery of this film any day!!!!!) in the sense of more than one tale: the foreground tells the story of Kakihara, the guy who is obsessed with solving this horrific obscenity, then the background of the film tells the story of Ichi, the guy behind it. Because Ichi is observing and cowering away from anything that is connected to his crimes and this specific event, and seeing other people and how they are reacting to it, it's like watching Batman through The Joker's eyes!!The character of Ichi is extremely interesting with lots of character development, along with Kaneko and Jijii, but Ichi is by far the best character in this film. It's extremely hard to tell what is going to happen next, and all questionable elements in this film are ambiguous, which is awesome, because it is endlessly productive.Kakihara, played by the great Tadanobu Asano, is a very strange man, because he gets pleasure from receiving physical pain, which is the reason he is so interested in finding his boss Anjo, because it is his boss Anjo who fed him pain the way he liked it!!! Also, what is Kaneko's relationship with Ichi? And his son......?I know it all sounds bizarre, but it's just a film, and it's extremely interesting. I would like to warn women that there are some very graphic and intense scenes which women will be very offended by, but just keep paying attention and you'll notice that the film is not glorifying the negative things towards women (like when a guy spreads her legs and smells in between in an attempt to get an idea of who raped her!!! I know, they went too far on that one!!), and everyone who shows any abuse towards women gets what is coming to them, so it balances it out and makes it a positive message.Please, however, do not watch it dubbed, because that ruins any film, especially this, you miss a lot if you have it dubbed!! Subtitles please!Maybe you'll think I'm weird for saying this but I actually laughed a bit when watching it, because of the extreme sense of black humour (like smiling and getting an erection from watching bodies and guts fall apart onto the floor!!!!).Just don't take it too seriously, because it's a film, the makers of it are only trying to turn your head off for a couple of hours. Also, be warned, there are some pretty intense scenes for anyone, so if you have a weak stomach, probably best not to bother.Other than that, great acting, great plot, and an ending that will leave you gasping for air! This is difficult to explain because I'm not allowed to spoil it, nor do i want to, but when Kakihara does what he does to himself with the Stilettos on the rooftop at the end, and then what he is looking at next just pause it for a second and have a think, don't think that what you see is definitely happening. To be more specific, considering what he does with them, maybe he damaged his brain.....? That's one last thing, pay close attention to the scene where Ichi and Kaneko are eating noodles, it will throw you off guard a bit. Just make sure you are watching the uncut version.",positive
"ICHI THE KILLER isn't meant to be taken all that seriously, Director Takashi Miike created this insane, ridiculously extreme shocker for sheer entertainment value. Rather than dissecting it for its ""flaws"", or expecting it to compare to some plastic Hollywood abomination, it's better to just sit back and enjoy the madness!THE BASIC PLOT: Gangsters are being bumped off by Ichi (Nao Omori), a super-killer with serious psychosexual issues. Meanwhile, big boss Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), a sadomasochistic psychopath, longs for a final showdown with Ichi, so he can experience the ultimate in sadomasochism.Or, something like that.Ultra-mega-violence ensues.ITK is more comedy than horror-thriller. It's Miike being his loveable, nutty, wonderful self. So, don't expect SNOW WHITE or BEN HUR either. Just watch agog and smile...",negative
"I just saw some of this movie. It is really not worth seeing. The violence does not make any sense, like, say, the violence in ""Tetsuo"" or ""Audition"". This is just as boring and pointless as a Tarantino movie, and without the charm and great dialogue. I was very interested in the main character with the weird hair until a disgusting, pointless torture scene. Then I lost all interest in him and the movie. I had been hoping for a great film - like the Ring, Audition, Tetsuo or Tokyo Fist - but this is not at all in their league. The violence only makes you sick. It is not karthartic in any way.",positive
"Let me start off by saying, I'm a hardcore fan of the manga and I read it before watching the movie. In other words I can't help but have some bias towards changes that were made for the screen. This movie didn't exactly capture the elements I thought should be portrayed in a film adaption. Yeah it did the manga justice for the most part but the heart of the franchise just wasn't captured. The movie is called Ichi the Killer but who honestly sticks out the most in your mind? Without a doubt I'm sure it's Kakihara. He is definitely an essential element to this story but should not be the main focus. The directing style was commendable but I think the biggest flaw was the acting choice. Most of the actors just didn't fit their character. The best example is the guy who plays Ichi. He came off as mentally challenged and looked a couple years away from middle aged. Ichi is supposed to be in his early twenties, have shredded muscle definition, reflexes that borderline superhuman, and be psychologically damaged. Nao Omori just doesn't cut it. In the manga Ichi gave off the impression of an antihero that trailed on the range of villain but never quite crossed that line. Omori's version of Ichi just seemed like a creepy mental patient and never gave off any heroic qualities.This brings me to my next point which is the genre of the film. Reading the manga I got the vibe that this was an ultra violent and super bloody comic book type story. The movie was more of a straight up horror or ""torture porn"" type thing. Jirou and Saburou (the twins) are supposed to Goliath sized and bear body builder physique. Suzuki Matsuo (actor that portrayed the twins) is short and visually just seems weak. Jirou's strength in the comics is practically Schwarzenegger status. And where were Saburô's trademark dreadlocks and white suit? Honestly it was like an amateur wrote the character for film. It was not at all what I was envisioning while reading the manga.The only actors who were actually believable, memorable, and did their character justice were Tadanobu Asano (Kakihara), Jun Kunimura (Funaki), and Paulyn Sun (Karen). Seriously these actors made the film epic and are definitely what give this movie the rating it got. Everyone else made zero impression with their acting. Like some of the other actors were good but they weren't iconic. My only other problem with the movie was that it's based off a manga/comic series (which is action packed) and there's almost zero martial arts fight scenes. And no, I don't accept the excuse of limited technology. Look at the iconic fight scene in Oldboy. It used zero special effects but was still super badass. Was it perfect? Far from but it goes down in movie history none the less. If Takashi Miike would've choreographed a few of those hardcore fight scenes he's so famous for nowadays, I think the movie would've made more of an impression. Just my opinion.",negative
"Ichi the Killer (2001) is a Japanese movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a sexually frustrated man on a killing spree who one days kills the wrong Yakuza member. Some muscle is sent to find out who killed the Yakuza mobster and collect some missing funds. The mob quickly discovers it's an outside job by someone not related to their activities at all...but whom?This movie is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition) and stars Tadanobu Asano (Thor: Ragnarok), Nao Ômori (The Outsider), Shin'ya Tsukamoto (Tokyo First), Paulyn Sun (In the Mood for Love), Susumu Terajima (Sonatine) and Shun Sugata (Kill Bill Vol. 1).Everything about this movie is creative and unique. This is a legendary movie that really helped separate Takashi Miike as one of the next big things in gore. The kill scenes in this are out of this world and as real as it gets. The gruesome nature of every kill is so well done. The opening scene with cum is actuallly cum collected from the people who worked on the set and was used in the movie. The characters are very awkward and unpredictable and the scenes are so intense. The torture scenes are brutal and well done and I loved the use of needles and hooks. The soundtrack is also good as is the blood splatter. There's a boobies scene in this that's tough to watch. The ending of this movie is absolutely insane and very smart.Overall, this is a brilliant addition to the horror genre that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",positive
"I heard about this movie a few years ago but it took a bit of time to track it down. And it was certainly worth the hunt. It was completely and utterly different than anything I was expecting. Everything that I had heard about it underlined the extreme gore and violence, to the point that I figured that is all it had to offer. However, when watching it, I didn't seem to notice the violence at all. I was totally engrossed in this world of criminals and assassins. I think the single most interesting thing about the entire film was the choice of the hero. Sure it's technically Ichi, but it's really Kakihara's movie. Ichi is a bit distant and overly emotional for viewers to root for. And the audience is almost forced to root for Ichi's opponent. Kakihara is by no means a hero (He tortures his way through the entire movie, mostly inflicting pain on people who seemingly don't deserve it.) and yet the audience is drawn to him. Miike deserves immense praise for taking a seemingly disgusting character with little redeeming value and making him the sympathetic lead. I doubt any mainstream American film would ever have the guts to craft this sort of narrative around a sadistic and yet (somehow) likable lead. I strongly recommend this film for anyone who is looking for a completely different cinematic experience. I also think that even people who do not typically enjoy gory films can find something to like in Ichi, it truly is a film like no other.",positive
"A twisted masterpiece that smears yolk ridden phlegm onto the mutilated corpse of Miike's canvas; chunky reds painted into lifeless grays. The sadistic dollop of sour curd slowly filling the negative space until one is forced to eat Miike's dish, served cold with comedy and satire drenched in the blackest of humor; appearing most inappropriately at its greatest euphoric climax of cruelty and sadism. If one is able to masticate the thick and stringy pulp of Ichi the Killer, on the other end they're to be greeted by the deeper smegma of fetid toxic masculinity, festering sadomasochism and a seepage of humanity operating at its most inhumane.~ 91.7%",positive
"In the weirdest of ways, this is not the movie I was expecting. 'Ichi the killer' is notorious for graphic, explicit violence, and sure enough, we get plenty of it. Yet at the same time that much of the torture and brutality is simply grotesque and hard to watch, there's a bizarre artistry to some of the blood and gore. There's also less crimson and viscera than I anticipated, which in some ways I suppose one should be grateful for under the circumstances. Meanwhile, of course the story being told is grisly, yet it's even darker and more bleak than I could have guessed. Sometimes the plot development is very plain and straightforward; conversely, wide swaths of the narrative are altogether disordered and abstruse as they present. Through it all we're nonetheless told a tale that's ultimately complete, coherent, and cohesive - only, the film goes about communicating it in the most outrageous manner possible. It's a wild, gnarly, sometimes almost unwatchable ride, but when all is said and done, I can only congratulate Takashi Miike - 'Ichi the killer' is, after all, rather extraordinary.Even at their most cartoonish the abundant effects are outstanding, including the blood and gore, special makeup and prosthetics, and props. And the visual presentation at large quite mirrors that excellence. I've seen a few of Miike's features at this point, and of those I have, it rather seems to me that 'Ichi' boasts the most fullness of vision. In the primo filming locations, production design, and art direction, there's an attention to detail that makes each scene pop out with vibrant life even without taking into account the narrative content. Further bolstered with Hideo Yamamoto's exquisitely rich cinematography and pristine, mindful lighting, each and every scene looks and feels so vivid as if we could reach out and touch it. And for as well made as his other pictures may be, Miike demonstrates a fluidity and thoughtfulness in his direction here that makes the entire grim tableau seem more natural and real - contrasted with, say, the fantastical slant of 'Gozu,' or the overproduced sterility of 'Blade of the immortal.' And all this is to say nothing of the rather incredible costume design, hair and makeup work, stunts, or fight choreography, nevermind the stupendous keen eye of editor Yasushi Shimamura who assembled this into the dazzling form we see.Down to the last, 'Ichi' is incredibly well made. This extends to the cast, all giving exceptional performances that bring their characters to brilliant life; given the most time on-screen, it stands to reason that Tadanobu Asano, Nao Omori, and Shinya Tsukamoto stand out the most, but one help but be impressed with the wide range of skills that everybody demonstrates here. And screenwriter Sakichi Sato has achieved a wizardly feat in adapting a manga to the screen, for from top to bottom the script is phenomenal. Characters, dialogue, scene writing, and the narrative alike are brimming with complexity and electricity that lets every small moment stand apart all by itself. Even at its most outlandish or oblique, there's tremendously sharp intelligence to the writing and orchestration of each scene and story beat that's as deeply compelling as it is morbid and gritty. I assumed 'Ichi' was going to be a gruesome romp; I never would have imagined so absorbing a tale of manipulation, power struggles, and psychological morass to be cloaked within its barbarity.It's safe to say that the audience for this is probably smaller than most titles. Everything that makes 'Ichi the killer' so marvelous a viewing experience is going to be an obstacle and limiting factor for many people, from the violence to the off-kilter storytelling. For anyone open to all the wide, weird possibilities that cinema has to offer, however, this is far more deserving than its infamous reputation would lead one to believe. In terms of both its narrative and the movie's fundamental craft there's a refreshing vitality coursing through this title that not every picture can claim; that it's dressed up in such proliferate bloodletting - well, that's just part of the saga to be imparted. Though it won't appeal to everyone, suffice to say that I'm frankly blown away by just how good 'Ichi the killer' is, and it earns two big thumbs-up from me!",positive
"Ichi the Killer is one very bloody film,it may be one of most bloodiest that i ever saw and to people who love extremely big gore fest and blood in every scene ,they will love this film.But to me this film was a somewhat dissapointing ,i was expecting something more from it in a story or character departments but i get a very little of that.Some scenes were also very laughable cause they didnt looked very good like when face was falling on a wall and a bodybuilder guy with a old man face on him,Ichi the Killer had some fun moments and cool to look at action scenes and creative deaths but i was also expecting something more from it",negative
"For one thing I can be really grateful to the director of Koroshiya. Thanks to his movie I was able to establish a reference, the indisputable absolute when it comes to how bad a movie can be. I do not mind the senseless violence, that I have seen only too often, especially in Asian productions (e.g. Oldboy - not a very good film either, in my opinion), nor would I nag about too much sex (which here actually was a bit over the top, even concerning today's standards), but the plot itself was as boring as tripe with oil and for the first time in my life I actually regretted wasting my time watching a film. Maybe it is because I am not a fan of manga (I actually think a good movie should be able to defend itself, without forcing the viewer to read a comic series prior to watching it)... After reading some of the comments here I was truly amazed to see that some people were actually able to make sense out of it all! Anyway, if any of you are thinking of devoting some of the precious time they have left in their lives to watching Ichi the Killer, please think again and maybe go for a walk instead?",negative
"I've seen Audition, Zebraman, his yakuza movies, and this live action remake of a perverted manga called Ichi the Killer (Koroshiya 1). Miike has some great taste. I must mention though, that American viewers tend to judge Miike just by perverted films like this, Visitor Q (banned in Japan), Imprint, and Audition. Keep in mind that Miike has directed several children's TV shows and movies.I didn't really enjoy the manga. It was much more perverted and grotesque and serious than Miike's movie. Penis getting cut in half for pleasure (which in the movie wasn't shown), no humor, masturbation, nauseating sex, and the character, Kakihara, was UGLY. Not a nice guy Tadanobu Asano, but a long haired, fat, unshaved mid 40s masochist man who had his body turtle shell bound (traditional Japanese SM hog tying technique) when he had the final showdown with Ichi. His penis gets sliced in two by Ichi by the way. Thats the true Kakihara. Ichi was very well expressed in live action; almost looks exactly, and acts exactly, like the main character of the manga.I think Miike did a great job on directing this film. The movie was much more enjoyable and humorous, and the relationship between Jijii and Karen was better portrayed in the movie than in the original manga. The acting by Asano was amazing. The actor Asano I know is a cool guy which doesn't speak that much. A quiet, talented actor. He showed off his talent by being a total pervert. The entire movie was made flashy and stylish because of Asano, replacing the original figure of Kakihara.I'm not gonna say much about it. It's a good film. You like horror? You like gore? Or maybe you have that Sado-Masochistic side? Either way, you should watch this film. It's great. Oh but please don't think that all Japanese people are perverted people with screwed up moral and minds, because there are some great dramatic movies like Miyazaki films and Nobody Knows that went to Cannes",positive
"This is, without doubt, one of my personal favourite films of all time. But beware, you should only watch this if you are able to cope with extremely graphic sado-masochistic violence. For me, it is worth sitting through and having all my senses brutalised for the sake of what the director is trying to do to his audience. Ichi the Killer is very beautiful underneath, and you need to have your sensitivity ripped away in order to really feel for the sadness of the characters. They are all searching for fulfilment, but they have become so desensitised to everything that now only pain can really touch them. It's almost as if Miike is reflecting an exaggerated vision of his audience themselves (us), who have become so hardened (or perhaps jaded) by popular culture that they increasingly turn to extreme cinema for their kicks.The tag line for the film's release in Japan was ""Ai wa, kanari itai"", meaning, ""Love really hurts"", and that is what it's all about here; Miike examines the idea that if love is pain, then perhaps pain can be love, and indeed for Kakihara and the others the greatest expression of love is pain. Kakihara is so terrifying in his sadism for most of the film that it comes as a powerful shock to realise that he is simply desperate for what, for him, is the only kind of love.Miike is also a master of humour. Okay, I know you have to get past the general sickness of a film with such graphic scenes of torture, rape and violence, but it's only a piece of art, after all, and the film deliberately emphasizes its artificiality. You can laugh at it, and if you allow yourself to laugh it is brilliantly funny. Miike has also shot scenes so beautifully that some stand out very powerfully indeed, and help to draw together all these opposing elements that he is trying to marry to each other: pain and love, beauty and ugliness, life and death, humour and horror. He da man.Finally, this edition of Ichi is supposedly very good. Although there seems to me no point in cutting Ichi the Killer for reasons of decency (because then it would be about five minutes long) it seems that the original Western releases were cut slightly; there is a torture scene missing, I believe. I think that everything that's in Ichi is vitally necessary to the overall effect of the film so I would advise you to buy this, the fully uncut version.If you liked this movie you should enjoy one of Miike's more famous and darker films (possibly to rank with such greats as Dead or Alive or Audition). Just don't put the English dubbing on; The English dub is just plain funny and you'll end up missing most of the film laughing at the dull, lifeless, cockney voice actors doing the dub.",positive
"Well, what is there to say about Ichi The Killer? Well it is easily one of the greatest foreign films ever made. Right next to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai or his movie Ikiru. From the beginning part with the brutal beating and rape sequence, to the strange ending in which my favorite character in the movie Kakihara dies, is all good fun. Now, i have viewed many films in my time and nothing compares to the first scene of Yakuza Boss Anjo beating and raping a prostitute. Now knowing about Takashi Miike's other films before i saw Ichi The Killer (Audition, Visitor Q, Dead Or Alive to name a very small fraction.) I knew this movie was going to be gory fun. Some parts of it seems tacked on or just thrown there for fun, like the part the man's arm gets ripped off. Now it was rather comical and sick because it was definitely not needed in the film. But everything else in the film makes up for it. Normally i wouldn't recommend a movie with intense gore and repulsive rape here and there. But this movie has a different meaning to it all and shows the audience, even challenges them to watch it almost. Ichi the Killer is a sick movie, and like my family members explain, is a perverted movie. Though i don't believe what they think because they do not know good cinema. Ichi is rather about changing in life. The ACTUAL star of the film, a boy named Ichi, starts off as a scared little kid that is a Sadist. Now Sadism is weird and messed up, and Ichi does not realize why he likes to beat women and kill. But in the end, he changes from a scared kid who kills, to a human being rather. This movie should be viewed by only people who are not grossed out easily, because this movie will possibly mess the right person up if seen... Will",positive
"This is honestly one of the best movies i've seen in a while. It really spiced my night, and i'm urging for more movies made by Takahashi Mike.It's like a mix between Old boy and Pulp Fiction, to not be too specific. Since the movie has a lot of good and memorable characters and, in the meanwhile, a deep and psychologically tickling plot. The action never ends, and the brutal scenes comes like some sort of revelation every time they pop up. I give it 10 out of 10 possible. I'd probably add even an extra point if it was possible, Spinal Tap style./ Max",positive
"Brilliant film! It came across more black humour than anything else. Despite the warnings I've read in reviews and on the box, I found the graphic scenes were no worse than films like ""Braindead"" or other gorefests - in a different style of course! The way the killings were executed was almost cartoon-like, comical even. Very much like a living Manga cartoon. I loved Ichi himself, what a character! The outfits worn by the central characters were great, certainly inspired me to customise my woollen beanie for winter. The soundtrack was fantastic, full of energy. I liked the opening scene featuring Ichi on his bike - with the Asian Dance track, it was almost like a slick music video.A must-see for fans of more 'adventurous' Asian cinema!",positive
"I remember going to a used video store a couple of years ago and seeing a copy of this film sitting on one of the shelves in front of me. At the time Ichi the Killer hadn't reached mainstream American popularity so finding the film was a little bit of a challenge.I knew virtually nothing about the film other than the intriguing cover of Kakihara's face staring at whoever looked in the direction of the box. I left without buying the film but after doing some research I shortly returned so I would be ensured that no one else would manage to take it. I took that film home and watched it, as the end credits rolled I turned the DVD off and then immediately started it over.Ichi the Killer is one of the few films in my large collection that I own all editions of and is also one of the films that I can go back and watch at any given moment. It's mix of torture, graphic violence and masochism are something that are very rarely captured in modern cinema.Only a director like Takashi Miike could truly capture the essence of such a rough subject matter and turn it into something beautiful. This is one of the few movies I would ever reward a ten to and one of my all time favorite movies. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is into the graphic Japanese horror films or anyone trying to expand their foreign collections.Ichi the Killer is sure to make a pleasant addition to any fan's foreign film collection.",positive
"Miike films (in particular Ichi) have, in my opinion, developed an unwarranted ""most disturbing"" title. Granted, it all comes down to what disturbs the individual, but for Miike films (again in particular, Ichi) to disturb you more than anything, torture would have to be the thing that floats your boat. And for me, that doesn't really cut it -- no pun intended.I think the main reason that I wasn't impressed with this (besides having just watched the amazing Oldboy) is because of all the fan warnings I read about Ichi; claiming that it was 10 times gorier and more violent than Kill Bill... What the hell? Did I watch a different 130 min uncut version? I don't mean to downplay the horror Ichi the Killer depicts; there is some really messed up stuff to be seen here, but as far as violence and gore go, you could do better with Kill Bill, and even better with something like Dawn of the Dead or a reputable giallo film.I wouldn't say steer clear, because any video nasty and gore fan would probably have already seen this, and I don't want to discourage people that are remotely interested either because it's a good film in it's own right, but people should really stop holding this in such high regard among the ""most disturbing"" class... It really doesn't rank that highly. 6/10.",negative
"This is avantgarde art-house violence at its best, it is based on manga which is obvious watching the few first minutes of this film. Another brilliant post-post-modern artwork from Takashi Miike. After seeing the film I was just totally speechless.",positive
"That is one wicked tale and one hell of a razor-sharp blade!I have just begun scouring Takeshi Miike's filmography and after seeing only two of his works (Auditon & his part in Three...Extremes); My presumptuous mind could make a pretty good guess about what I was getting myself into. Regardless, it still caught me off guard. I knew I would be served a plate full of violent and nauseating dishes but what I did not expect though is to see them go into full berserk mode here.Based on a popular Manga, It's a full-blown Yakuza-inspired narrative that overweeningly exhibits a sadistic, harrowing array of violence as well as a frightening description of one psychotic, perverted murderer called Ichi, who's wreaking havoc in the city with his remorseless kills and ceaseless savagery.If this premise sounds like something right up your alley, then you are more than welcome to check this one out but please be solicitous of all the chopped-off limbs, hacked-up entrails, severed nipples, and oh! Yes, do not forget the literal pool of blood and all the unapologetically depicted and crafted sequences of defilement and exploitation.Hello! Are you still there? Good, go on then, grab a bag of popcorn and let the fun begin.",positive
"One of the most graphically violent films, ever to hit these shores, albeit in a truncated version (no doubt). Only the 'Land of the Rising Sun', can produce such a gore loving movie and stays really faithful to its original 'Manga' roots. It's crazy, bonkers and 'Out There', pushing the envelope till it bursts at the seems.",positive
"You could call this the Japanese ""Dead Alive."" Like Jackson's best work (aside from LoTR,) Ichi the Killer is so over-the-top in the blood and guts dept, it becomes a comedy. And this movie is really, really funny. Imagine the opening scene of Miike's ""Dead OR Alive"" stretched out and you've nailed the mood of ""Ichi"": manic, energetic, violent, shocking, and a bit nonsensical at times. Yes, the plot brought up so many different themes and ideas - sex, violent human nature, personal freedom, justice - the film became a bit muddled. But a few things are clear - Miike's got some great ideas and he knows how to showcase them. He's also got some excellent characters. Kakihara is the coolest anti-hero ever. I would respect and fear anyone who did that to his face to begin with, but...this guy is very complex. Ichi, too, is complex, and provides a great pathetic foil to Kakihara's more laid-back attitude. I loved this movie just as much as ""Audition,"" but in a different way. ""Ichi"" is some of the best entertainment I've seen from Japan in recent times.",positive
"What a brilliant film. The directing is stylish and original. The acting is great and provides us with characters that will be forever remembered (halfway through the movie it felt like this was the 4th or 5th sequel and I knew these characters for a long time). The story is so fascinating, taking us into the minds of a sado-masochist and a brainwashed killing machine that seeks revenge. The final showdown between these two characters is unforgettable in my books, and will be talked about for a long time (to try to understand it). Anyone who loves a great movie experience (at least unforgettable), go see Ichi the Killer.",positive
"Wow, this movie has to be one of the most violent movies i've ever watched. I wont spoil anything, but it's about a twisted psychopath killer name Ichi. He's addicted to killing and it puts a smile on his face. It's the only thing that makes him happy. While KakiHara is the best and toughest gangster in the whole town, only one thing stands in his way, Ichi! KakiHara loves a challenge. No one can ever beat him. No one cam kill him. For he's the toughest gangster around. That's why he wants to meet Ichi and have a one on one fight together. Get Ready To Rumble! The camera moves up and down quite abit, but it suites the moment. Please keep this movie away from little kiddies! I'd give this movie a good 10/10!!",positive
"Wow, 7.2...did we see the same movie? RT rates this movie 64%, which is a more realistic grade, and metacritic rates this a 50, which is even closer to its true quality.I had heard a lot about this film but wasn't really interested in watching it...I should have stayed on this first impression. I found this flick incredibly boring, and not nearly as violent as everybody says. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of women being beat up, raped, guys getting tortured, etc, etc...but ""Braindead"" is about three times gorier than this idiotic piece of trash.The ""script"" is confused, weak and uninteresting. When a yakuza crime boss disappears, a SM enforcer goes looking for him and stumbles upon Ichi, a retarded child-like whining killer that cums when he kills people. Kakihara (aforementioned enforcer), being a great fan of pain, sets out to meet Ichi and hopes he gets his rocks off when Ichi goes to town on him. That's about it. The concept of sadist VS masochist is a promising idea, but this movie fails to do anything remotely interesting with it.The dialog is absolutely awful, boring, and doesn't make any sense (as in a lot of Japanese productions). There are many (boring) scenes in the film that are utterly pointless, a myriad of useless characters, Ichi's acting is annoying and retarded. Kakihara is an original and charismatic character but still that doesn't make the movie worthwhile.The ""over the top violence"" everybody raves about is impressively disappointing; this film is two hours long and it contains less than half an hour of cheesy, caricatural violence (so that's an hour and a half worth of dull and meaningless dialog, absurd pointless scenes that go nowhere and random stretches of nothing that make absolutely no sense). The special effects are cheap, dreadful and mix unconvincing CGI with practical techniques, mostly rubber hoses that spray gallons of obviously fake blood when throats get cut open.Stylistically it's got some notable ideas, but then again, that doesn't suffice to make this film close to compelling.I really liked ""Audition"" so I was all the more disappointed by this ridiculous flick. I'll be honest and admit that I don't ""get"" Japanese art in general; I enjoy Kurosawa or Kitano, but for the most part I'm really annoyed by the trademark Japanese absurdity and the ""lol so random"" elements that undermine Nippon productions most of the time. I seriously don't understand people that are into this ridiculous accumulation of nonsense : take a bunch of concepts that have absolutely no link or resemblance with one another, shake them up, chuck the content on a table and call the resulting pile of incoherence art.Terrible, lame and random garbage that likes to think of itself as counterculture. Fails to live up to the hype and incredibly boring.",negative
"Wow this movie was just crazy! This is probably one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen in awhile. It's just very graphic and really sick! I was never really into Japanese horror movies, until I saw this. This Takashi Miike makes some really disturbing horror movies. So far I've seen his Ichi The Killer, Imprint, Audition, and Gozu. All of these movies are just crazy as heck! Ichi The Killer is about this guy named Ichi that goes around and kills people. There is much more to the story though. You actually see Kakihara in the movie more than Ichi. In my opinion Kakihara is more violent than Ichi in the movie. The movie has some very disturbing scenes too, so I warn you. It's not for anyone that has a weak stomach. The nastiest scene I'd say is the tongue scene. That was just disgusting and looked too realistic. This movie also has some cool fight scenes. I highly recommend this movie though, if you like weird horror movies and your looking for something very different. Ichi The Killer is one of bloodiest movies I've seen. It also has one very weird ending too. There's also a prequel to this movie, it's called Ichi-1. It's pretty good, but no where near as cool as Ichi The Killer. It's about Ichi in high school getting bullied.I give Ichi The Killer 10/10",positive
"Everyone who has seen this film seems to think that it is so brutal and gross that it makes it interesting to go and see it. Well let me give you some info. It is not that bloody and gory. Sure it has a couple of gross scenes, but I'd hardly call the film a stomach turner. When there is some violence it is either a bit gross or it is quite funny (I guess you'd have to see the film to understand or buy that one). I know this film IS NOT gross or gory, but I know what it IS as well: it is pulp. This is pulp fiction people and although it is pretty well made it is not entertaining. This is the type of film that is neither a masterpiece nor a film that'll put you to sleep. It is just OK, although the direction and acting are good. I guess a lot of people who'll go and see this film will be attracted by the outraged screams of: GORIEST MOVIE EVER (I know I was a little, but I also saw Ôdishon by Miike and thought it was pretty good). Believe though when I tell you that the film is not that gory, it's just a bit disturbed. If you want to have your stomach turned rent Irréversible! If you want a bit of guts and blood, rent a zombie movie or try this one if you don't believe me!

"...too long and self-indulgent.I've heard of the notorious nature of this movie for a long time and lived up to the reputation in regards to violence. Not sure why it needed such emersion in such, but it is what it is. I guess that brings directors like Takashi Miike and Tarantino to the party, but I'd personally be in favor of more artful character development to back it up.I appreciated many of the avenues it touched on in regards to an unending flood of mob and yakuza movies. Why anyone would live this world? What part of these psychopaths are human and caring? It seemed to put the world a bit on its head with things like the office building for yakuza. (The building made me think of the subsequent The Raid, a logistical element that was clearly adapted for the follow year's version of Judge Dredd. Which likely sprouted from the earlier Die Hard.)At just over 2 hours, it felt long vs what was depicted as it touches on---many times sloppily and hastily---a variety of story elements that would be far more interesting if they were fleshed out in a series or mini-series. Yes, I know that sounds like a contradiction.Not much at all for sadism against women but do enjoy the eventual revenge payoff.Really thought the ending fell flat, although Ichi killing the little boy was a shocker.Being American, Japanese and Chinese movie storytelling strikes me as forcing melodrama on you vs the more effective subtlety. But also a medium always pressed for time.I do understand the vicarious thrill of depicting extreme violence as it does. With others like Tarantino, it developed into a signature of credibility. As if it displays bravado and gutsy (no pun intended) filmmaking. I saw this in 2021---20 years after its release---and felt like it met its sell-by date and is getting old. But that's the market.Shocked to read here that the director, Takashi Miike, has 110 directing credits. A vast majority feature-length movies. Hardly a film historian, I did notice that a large portion of them are extremely violent, touching on teenagers and yakuza. And how do you do that many movies for 30 years? Filmmaking is a long process and requires a lot of time. With such a high reputation as he does, there has to be personal goals within him. And those don't take a short time unless he thinks in incredibly fast speeds and is clear on his intent, each and every time. Especially more surprising as he only has 4 writing credits vs the directing.What little I do know about Japanese magna and film is that can often be very bananas. His resume sure seems to back that up.",positive
"As a suburban teenager, before the rise of streaming, I was bound by the selection found at the local Blockbuster. I would make occasional trips downtown to an indie video store and marvel at all the ""cool"" movies I was missing out on. The shocking imagery on the DVD cover of ""Ichi the Killer"" burned itself into my brain and I coveted the film ever since. Returning to it as an adult with access to all the outsider art ever made, I feel torn on it's merits.For starters, it absolutely lives up to it's own promise, and still holds up as one of the most graphically gory films I've ever seen. I recognize that quantity of bloodshed is a rather immature metric to judge something on, and in this way the film begins to feel like a product of it's time. Is it just me, or was society as a whole going through a teenage edge-lord phase in the late 90s/early 2000s? Seeing as it's from the height of Xtreme marketing, torture-porn, nu-metal and violent video games calls into question whether this film is legitimately pushing boundaries, or just succumbing to the tacky excess of something like Strangeland.Now that society has woken up to it's early 20s, liberal arts college, social justice phase, the film's depiction of women seems questionable, to say the least. Rape is a consistent theme, and all the female characters seem to exist purely as fodder for inevitable sexual violence. Granted the film aspires to push your buttons in any way it can, but justifying this grim, one dimensional portrayal as harmless shock value seems shallow, and borderline misogynistic.Morality and carnage aside, there is plenty left to admire about the film. The overall oddball sensibility to Takashi Miike's direction comes through in a number of ways, from the wacky score by none other than noise legends The Boredoms, to the shaky camera cinematography, to the sick sense of humour at the core of the cartoonish excess. The practical effects work is well done enough to provoke the intended discomfort, though there's one CGI moment that I'm not sure was intentionally comedic. The character of Ichi is a brilliantly strange protagonist, at once a heroic vigilante, a perverted predator and a sniveling coward, leaving the film with absolutely no moral core. The final anti-climax is a hilarious subversion to action/superhero tropes.It does run a little long though, and there's a point where the grisly interrogations become redundant. In a common misstep in the gangster genre, there's a needlessly complex web of one off characters that start to become confusing to differentiate.Nevertheless, it's hard to deny the film's impact, and for one reason or another, it still manages to stand out over twenty years from it's release.",positive
"Rambling, unstructured to the point of disjointedness, the story follows a bunch of unsavory Yakuza thugs (is there another kind?) being killed off one by one by some unknown vengeance seeker. Torture, disemboweling, masochism every kind of brutality is served up for director Miike's camera and reveled in by a large cast of unrepentant gangster twistos. The world on view here is a disturbing one; every character seems to be motivated by some violent perversion or other and even by-standers are not exactly innocent. The action is non-stop - every few minutes a new horror is unveiled - and the visual effects and camera-work are often stunning - I'm still wondering about one effect early on in which a character with a fondness for piercing appears to blow smoke out the side of his face!This film is an exercise for jaded gore hounds only. Anybody new to the Japanese Ultra-violence genre is advised to approach with ultra-caution.",positive
"*VERY MINOR SPOILERS* I had heard about ""Ichi The Killer"" for a long time, perhaps 2 for 3 years now and I didn't buy it because I wasn't sure if I'd get it or not. I don't mean to be racist or anything but I knew ""Ichi The Killer"" had many characters in and its Asian so everyone looks similar and the names are just phenomenal! Therefore I didn't think I'd be able to keep up with the plot, even though I'm a big fan of Asian films and gore. Anyways, I bought Ichi and was really excited about seeing it after hearing the hype surrounded by it and its a bit of a mixed bag for me.Let's begin negative (so we can end positive :)) my fears were very much confirmed. I did not have a clue what was going on in the first 45 minutes or so. It seemed a hyper plot with loads of characters with confusing names and faces, continuously talking making it hard to digest what's being said and so I only sort of grasped it slightly. Luckily, after this and when we are introduced to Ichi (who I thought was the blonde guy with scars for years!!) the plot becomes more structured. Instead we don't jump around like before so its much easier to follow. We also get to know characters more in depth which is brilliant! Second half was a much nicer time for me.Like most Asian films, scenes were weird, which is a great thing! I love to see originality and Ichi wasn't short of that! There is one death scene that just left me amazed! (you know the one ;)) The gore in this film is incredible with a sadistic torture scene, self mutilation and plenty of shoe kills! The blood is really over the top, like in ""Kill Bill"" making it fun and different. Ichi is a very different film and is definitely a one off and some credit has to be given for that.The best part for me was the finale, Mr Miike's directing is absolutely superb (and is throughout actually). The final scene stands as one of the greatest climax's I have ever witnessed! Thankyou for that Miike! Overall, ""Ichi The Killer"" is weirdly entertaining and quite brilliant, but with some disappointing flaws. Scenes did sometimes drag but the OTT violence and brilliant characters saved it from being an average film, to a brilliant film with flaws. It's not for everyone but you can't say it isn't different",positive
"What a great film......that's all I had to say after watching this. Sure, there was alot of blood and guts, but in the end that wasn't what was on my mind. I remembered Tadanobu Asano's brilliant performance, Takashi Miike's excellent direction, Shinya Tsukamoto's energetic cameo. Yep, this was one hell of a film alright! The start will get your heart pumping. The music will get your head nodding. The ending will leave you wanting more! Any way you can, get this film!P.S I was lying about not remembering the blood and guts! That stuff will stay on my mind for a very loooooong time!",positive
"I have been on an Asian Film kick lately. Watching all kinds of films but especially horror and revenge films. I had never heard of ICHI THE KILLER. I read only parts of reviews because I didn't want to know much going in. What these reviews mostly say is that it is brutally violent. It is is brutal but the violence is comic book over the top, not realistic. From the first 10 minutes the film is obviously a violent black comedy.The film is about a yakuza enforcer Kakihara who is tasked with finding a mob boss that has been murdered. Meanwhile, a demented young man named Ichi is seen witnessing a brutal rape of a prostitute. He gets sexually aroused at the view of the rape. He is really a sadistic killer. Kakihara is determined to find his boss's killer
He is also very sadistic, at one point torturing a man by hanging him by hooks and pouring scalding oil on his back. There is Jijii, a cleanup guy for the yakyza that convinced Ichi that he was bullied as a kid and needed to avenge this by killing the bullies in the world. Ichi killed his victims in an over the top manner that is so over the top violent that it reminded me of outrageous violence in Evil Dead. The film is very.much a black comedy, the interactions between characters are very funny at times. The reviews that I have seen have said that the film is difficult to watch. I tend to think that the more over the top violence is in a film the less horrifying it is. I will say that the disturbing parts of the film are the scenes of rape and torture of women. Those scenes were the only ones I found to be hard to watch. I found out after I saw the film that it is based on a Japanese manga of the same name. That explains the over the top stylized violence. I am not a huge manga fan but have seen enough to notice what this film was going for.I thought I was going into seeing a violent crime drama. What turned out to be was a very well made but totally outrageous adult live action cartoon. On that level it works.",positive
"This is definitely not for everyone, but if you have a thing for gangsters and old-school splatter B movies, go for it. After I saw the title coming out of a puddle of sperm in the opening sequence, I was already in love.The film starts as a simple yakuza revenge story, but it gradually turns into the quintessential masochist's quest for punishment. Ichi is idealized by Kakihara as the ultimate sadist that will finally give him what he wants, but things are not exactly as he imagined. The plot is a little confusing and way too over the place, but honestly, it just felt like a pretext to connect all torture and rape scenes. Violence is as graphic as it is cartoonish, and as you are enjoying it, you will start to feel as sadistic as Ichi.The scene where Jijii strips off made me feel sorry for having made fun of Chris Evans' CGI in the first Captain America film. Most memorable scene ever.",negative
"I thought that Ichi The Killer was a extremely violent and very gory movie. When a Yakuza boss named Anjo disappears with 300 million yen, his chief henchman, a sadomasochistic man named Kakihara, and the rest of his mob go out looking for him. After capturing and torturing a rival Yakuza member by hanging him up by meat hooks, and having boiling water poured over his back. they soon realise they have the wrong man and begin looking for the man named Jijii who tipped them off in the first place. Soon Kakihara and his men encounter Ichi who turns out to be a psychotic, sexually-repressed young man with fantastic martial arts abilities and blades that come out of the end of his his shoes. One by one Ichi takes on all members of the Yakuza gang and all the while Kakihara carries on his pursuit of Ichi and Ichi's controller Jijii. I thought that this was an extremely brutal and gory horror film with very graphic bloody violence that might be to much for some viewers i found that i had to look away from the screen in certain parts of the film. But a great film. 8/10",positive
"If gore wasn't a semi-established kind of icnema, this movie would be probably banned. In this hysterical comedy, blood flows like a river, and the human pain depicted in it is so gruesome that if you survive to the end without leaving the theatre, then you can say you've really seen everything that screen violence has to offer. This one has it all - literal bloodbaths, people hung by cattle hooks, boiling oil over the back and head of a naked guy and human pieces splattered all over the place. The story focuses on an avenger with a fetish for violence, that kills like some source of pleasure, even though if he feels sick afterwards. But he can't help it, and he's being used. From cult director Takashi Mike, this movie starts where Peter Jackson left, making surely the biggest slasher-fest of the year - and suceeding as a great comedy timer in the process. Watch at your own responsability but be warned: sometime it really hurts to watch.",positive
"All of the other comments on IMDB about this film tell you everything you need to know.This is another fantastic film from Takashi Miike and if you have seen the likes of DOA, Fudoh or Visitor Q then you will know what to expect. However, it is fair to say that Miike cranks up the gore to another level in this film and some of it is likely to shock even the most jaded of splatter fans.However, if you are a jaded splatter fan buying this movie then DO NOT BUY THE HK CATEGORY 3 DVD version as it has been absolutely mauled by the HK censors. The film is still very violent (it is a Cat 3 film after all) but anyone who has read the reviews and watches the HK version will feel cheated. Almost every gory scene has been shortened, some a little, some a LOT, and some scenes have just been completely omitted. The soon-to-be released Japanese DVD appears to be uncut but does not have English subtitles.So unless you are a die-hard Miike fan or just can't wait to see this film, I'd strongly recommend waiting for an uncut release. It'll be worth the wait.",positive
"Too grotesque!
To be honest, I couldn't watch the images. I just listened to the voice. It was very tough!
Although I hate the painful description basically, I laughed at a tear-mouth and the slipping skin of face. So sometimes I wondered if it was a kind of comedies.Kakihara, one of yakuza leaders, was an excessive masochist. One day he knew 'Ichi' the killer. Ichi was bulled in high school and had traumatized still. So he beats 'the villains' up without emotions when his switch is turned on. Actually, he was a very sissy guy and hated to kill the others though. Or rather, I doubt if he beat them up because they were scattered messily. But the tortures which Kakiharawas did were more terrible for me than Ichi's slaughter.
I find the cruelty whether it is caused on purpose. Even the both killers were cruel, I felt like there were a border definitely.About the fashon, I liked all costumes which Tadanobu Asano wore! The iredescent coloured suits, the tongue piercing and more.",negative
"This is not a film for the faint hearted.  If you thought Audition was extreme, well, in the words of the song, you just ain't seen nothing yet. This is by far Takashi Miike's most violent and goriest film, but it is also the funniest.  Although some of the violence is shockingly realistic, particularly in the opening sequence, Miike draws once again on his Anime influences to produce a fast paced comic strip journey into the mind set which Audition only touched on, one of sadism, pain and torture.
It will be interesting to see if this film is granted a release anywhere in the west and in what format; this is definitely not the type of film that gets made in the UK or US and is refreshing because of it.",positive
"You'll probably see this because you've heard how violent it is. Let me tell you, Sin City, I Spit on Your Grave, Man Bites Dog, anything by Peckinpah or Tarantino do not compare to this film its so violent!!! The Yakuza boss has disappeared along with 300 Mn Yen. His Capo goes around town torturing various people to find out what happened to the boss. He is a man who lives for pain - giving and receiving and there is a particularly terrible scene at the negotiating table which will have you cringing. Parallel to this is the story of the killer - Ichi - who is actually quite timid but goes crazy because he's being hypnotized. When he goes crazy he decimates ""bullies"" with his shoes.Of course the plot is only there to serve up copious amounts of violence and of course Ichi and the Capo will have a showdown at the end of the movie.I like intelligent movies and not mindless ones. I think the only objective of this movie was violence of the highest order but it succeeds fully in its objective. There are moments of torture you will not forget. Considering this limited objective, the film is a success. I won't be seeing this again but I am glad I was able to sit through the entire thing. Watch it if your stomach can handle it - the unrated version!",positive
"I never really loved mafia/yakuza/godfathers movies, in fact, i disagree with the ideals of those kind of movies (especially the godfather trilogy and scarface). But here, the bad guys are showed in a more vulnerable way, almost human, but also in a more sadistic way than usual; we really see they are pure b*stards, and the character of Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto himself !)has the same point of view on them as any lucid person: these yakuzas have no right of being (except for the ex-cop). The story is quite simple in its big lines: Jijii, not a really good guy either, is an ex-yakuza and want to take revenge on a gang. He'll not do that by himself, but by training, hypnotizing and fill with HIS violence and HIS bad memories, an autistic yound man called Ichi. The cinematography is great and so are the story and the characters developments.Koroshiya 1 was the 1st movie from Takashi Miike i saw and it won't be the last!If i would have to compare it with the anglo-saxon/american film culture this would be like a melting of Tarantino, Lynch and A Clockwork Orange, the whole stuff showed on the Videodrome channel. I fully recommend this movie.",positive
"I rented this dvd in Japan and was really looking forward to seeing it.  I have mostly enjoyed my viewings of Japanese movies and i thought that this would be no exception.It was.  If you can handle or enjoy really sick (though fake) violence, this may be the movie for you.  It had interesting characters and interesting occurrences which you should remember for a while, but the graphic violence ruined the film for me.I have to give it a 3 out of 10.",negative
"ICHI THE KILLER is considered by many to be Takashi Miike's tour-de-force, no mean feat considering the Japanese genre director has in excess of 70 credits to his name. The beginning - a truly perverse scene where the title of the film rises from a pool of the titular character's semen - kicks the film off and conceptualizes its OTT nature, which is holds throughout the relatively lengthy 129 minute duration. The plot itself does not really circulate around Ichi - he is more an addition, and does not hold great relevance until almost half way into the film. When the boss of a Yakuza clan goes missing and is believed dead, his underlings - led by the masochistic Karihara - set out to look for him. Karihara tortures and massacres his way through the Japanese yakuza members until, eventually, his own gang disowns him, forcing Karihara to gather a group of renegades and set out on a private vendetta. Karihara's only obstacle, however, is Ichi - an infantile killer controlled by an ex-cop intent on taking the gangs down.ICHI THE KILLER is very interesting for a number of reasons and there are certain points in the film that are delightfully fun and others that are quite repulsive. The comedy is black as the Ace of Spades and will only amuse those who have an affinity for stuff like this. Not for the weak of stomach, some of the violence is over the top but it is overrated and not much more severe than some recent Hollywood fare such as HOSTEL and KILL BILL VOLUME 1. Overall a great movie - very enjoyable, with some of the gore set pieces deliriously over the top.",positive
"Given this is IMDb.com i guess i should expect to see people putting down this film. Casablanca is a classic and i bet i can find bad reviews of it here (no I am not comparing this film in any way to casablanca, so please don't comment on it like it was some sort of horrid offense against decent cinema everywhere).Push aside the hype surrounding this film as ""the ultimate gore film,"" it clearly is not. Most of the ""gory"" death is off camera, with blood and guts flying into frame, which gives it a more comedic effect. The few scenes of on camera killing get some points for ""coolness"" and a few more for the ""anime"" style blood effects (i.e.: Kill Bill Vol.1).This film in fact is more of a look into the world of sado-masochism (hears thousands of people run as far away from this film as they can based on that one classification). Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT A FETISH FILM, it has characters in it who are fetishists, but the film is not in any way meant specifically for fetishists.(spoilers)Kikihara is the Capo of a Yakuza (pictured on the poster image). His boss disappears one day (courtesy of Ichi, and some guys who cleaned up the gory mess he left behind) and he goes on a quest to find him, convinced hes alive. The reasoning behind his hope that the man isn't dead is because Kikihara is a masochist. His boss was a sadist, who beat him with such remorselessness that Kikihara was in a way in love with him. Once its clear that the boss is dead, and we get to see a little more of Ichi's handywork, he changes his reasoning behind the search.Now Kikihara wants to find Ichi, the monster. He believes Ichi kills without emotion, without remorse or hesitation, and so he wants to experience this. In essence hes searching for the ultimate in masochistic experiences, and he feels Ichi will provide it.Ichi on the other hand is a young man, he is very quiet, and nervous around people. This of course makes him a target for bullies, but bullies beware. When Ichi gets mad, he starts to cry. When Ichi starts to cry, you die.He runs around in a very superheroish black rubber costume with a giant florescent yellow ""I"" on the back, the heel on his shoes contain a switchblade type apparatus.Despite some reviews, this movie is well directed, well acted, AND WELL WRITTEN. I found myself glued to my seat, and for the sake of not missing a single word in the subtitles I even chose not to rummage around for my cigarettes. (I hate pausing a good movie, breaks the mood of the film)If your seeking this film for the Gore and the Gore alone, turn back now. If you're actually interested in a good plot line (you won't find many films like this in western cinema), excellent acting, and having to think just the slightest bit to keep the context of the movie straight, this movies for you. (come on we cant spend all of our time spaced out on the couch watching a movie made this year that we swear we saw 5 times before in the last decade)*recycles another plot line and runs off to write a screenplay*",positive
"The content in this Miike film was pretty shocking. I am surprised he even helped in some of it. This film was non stop messed up. All the characters were completely out of whack. I will admit, I did like some of the characters. Tadanobu Asano was probably my favorite character in the film. He was so mentally disturbed and loved to hurt himself. His forms of torture was pretty crazy too. Nao Omori was half and half for me. I liked the look of his character, but I didn't like what he was about. Actually a really close second on my list of characters would have to be played by Suzuki Matsuo. He actually played twins. But what I liked is how they seems normal at parts, but were actually really just as disturbed as Asano's character. Also of disturbing scenes in this movie and a really stupid story. But for the most part I really stayed interested in the film since the characters were so off the wall. But not one of Miike's bests by far.",negative
"Rape, ultraviolence, and Takashi Miike stand ready to tie you up and deliver you from the hands of middle-class morality.  The only redemption our time deserves comes in the form of this live action anime.  If you lack the egotism or stupidity required for happiness in clear view of the daily news, seek your release in perfected products of postmodern art.  This movie epitomizes the Japanese knack for distilling Western culture.  What Sade was to Robespierre, Miike is to the makers of our future.  Watch him closely to learn where we are going.  Then revisit that news broadcast with your eyes freshly peeled.",positive
"One thing can be said about this film; it is utterly CRAZY!!! Takashi Miike has really gone over the edge of normal films with Ichi The Killer. Having said that, I'm still not real impressed with Miike as a director.All of Miike's films are visually stunning, and Ichi is no different. The cinematography is fantastic, with sweeping camera shots and just plain gorgeous shots (especially Kakihara against the red background). The acting is also well done, with Tadanobu Asano being plain freaky as Kakihara.However, the plot is a mess. Characters are shown briefly, and we are supposed to recognize them when we are shown them an hour and a half later. Also, the sheer amount of characters is far too much for the viewer to remember. Also, the plot line itself is vague, especially in the first hour, and I spent half of the movie trying to figure out where this person fits in, or what exactly just happened.The gore level is reasonable, but it isn't the hardcore stuff people rant about after seeing this. You don't really see anything too visceral (especially when compared to Cannibal Holocaust, or even most Troma movies), just spurting necks and the such.Overall, while enjoyable in the second half, the plot confusion really brings down Ichi in the long run. While a good movie, the one major flaw cripples it. Recommend to J-Movie fans",negative
"I saw this movie over a month ago, i just couldn't believe how much it sucked... it has no plot at all, some stupid characters that think they're so evil for the sake of making violence just to ""entertain"" viewers(btw I got completely bored during the whole movie and wanted it to end, tedious as hell). The violence scenes are a joke, they use some lame effects that make everything look so fake that it's laughable... uncut or not, don't waste your money on this crappy film, it's not worth it, not even disgusting, this is a joke!!! even the title name sucks hahah ICHI THE KILLER'S FINAL RATING: * out of **********",negative
"Ichi the Killer is many things, revolting, inspired, incomprehensible, stylish, ingenious and frequently downright nasty. Pretty much all of the characters are vile by nature, or at best outlandishly screwed up, and every time that we are baited with an aparent good dead, a reverse value judgement is not far behind.The premise of Kikihara searching for his boss really just a device to get the action moving, and after that, well I really haven't a clue what's going on, or quite what many of the characters motivations are, or indeed if the the events are really happening or merely part of Kikihara's deranged fantasies. There's no definitive interpretation, so really you have to watch it and draw your own conclusions.Contains very extreme violence and torture, even by the standards of Jap extreme cinema. The UK DVD release that I saw appears to have a good 3-4 minutes missing, possibly a tender mercy.A fascinating and original film if you can stomach it. You may also feel like having a bath afterwords...",negative
"Well i have to start by stating that Ichi the Killer is without a doubt the Best film i have seen. I absolutely love the character ""Kakihara"" Tadanobu Asano was just fantastic in this film, his torture scenes were easy to watch and you kind of giggle along with him. All the characters in the film have their own parts to play, the actor who portrays Ichi done a fantastic job, you do feel sorry for Ichi and after watching it a few times you do start to understand everything that had happened to him that makes him turn into the cold hearted person who could Kill anyone at the drop of a hat. I love the fact that in the film you see the work of both a Sadist and Masochist something which is hard to find in most films. I was extremely sad when Ichi finally got Kakihara in the end i was hoping that we would get another film out of it. i would have loved to have seen the sequel. If you haven't already seen Ichi the Killer then this is a must have for anybody who loves deep and dark films.",positive
"No doubt there are a lot of issues with this film that causes some sort of offence, but mostly it is offending for what it comic-style is resembling.My only critic is the women depicted in this film just goes beyond my pain tolerance. I'm offended by the over use of women bashing and killing in this. And I state the main reason why; and it is because of rebalancing. That rebalance nearly had been inflicted on a man's penis being cut off. And here lies the target audience: men will wince more at this than any other part of the film. And I have this objection and that spoilt the whole thing for me.I give points for interest, execution, the manga style violence and filming... but I deduct a huge portion of my vote on the matter of females being extra fodder for these fools. Ok, make them all fools, but get that guy's dick cut off if you're serious.",negative
"Ichi the Killer was a decent movie. It does get a little bit confusing at times, and out of place. It's a movie that depicts mixture of good and evil, that in everything good there's evil, and everything evil there's good. It's a fun movie to watch. However, i had a problem that our main hero, Ichi, we dont really follow him as much, as the criminals, which is kinda a let down, when Ichi is the head-character. Also, the scene with the kid in the ending isn't really needed in my opinion, it's a really sad scene, and it just makes the movie more spicy. If you are a fan of I Saw The Devil and the classic Oldboy, you probably will like this.",positive
"It is very original and lots of blood, almost in a humorous way, but some very gruesome acts of rape. i think its funny how the little guy ends up being so tough and is the controller of Ichi and is the one who made him believe all that crap about him not helping the girl from being raped. Anyways, worth watching very sick and awesome. I wish they would have explained the history of Ichi more. I would also have liked to see more about the man with the piercing. It shows how the some Japanese gangs use old torture methods. Takabara was very sadistic. I think they went alittle overboard on the blood. I also wish they didn't have to show Ichi doing his thing, if you catch my drift when the girl was being raped and beaten. I do dig the martial arts. I wish the fight scene's were more in depth.",positive
"I dunno. Maybe I've seen too many gory movies lately, but I was expecting something much worse.In a nutshell, this is a gangster movie with an S&M patina. Neither the gangster stuff nor the S&M stuff is particularly convincing, and I guess nobody noticed that the baddie was a complete ripoff of The Joker.Technically, pretty good. Some decent performances, but also some downright Cage-esque overacting.Could have been a lot better. Could have been a lot gorier, could have been a lot sexier.",negative
"I truly believe that this is a film that deserves recognition for being an ultra violent,twisted and deranged story of anger, depression and sheer beauty. takeshi miike's way of portraying the violence on screen is one unmatched by all others. he shows it in an almost delicate way, in every gut wrenching,bone popping sequence we do see the huge amount of work put into making each frame of this classic movie. this films portrayal of ichi being hypnotised to kill when is at heart a peaceful soul can also be linked to that of Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", where Alex is subjected to the experimental ""ludovico's"" technique and Alex is forced to be a good citizen, depriving him of his natural capacity for violence. overall this ""journey"" of a film is one not to be missed or overlooked.Matthew Jordan 14",positive
"This is one of those movies that definately wont appeal to the ""mainstream"" (AKA stupid) movie audience who thinks Independence Day is the finest piece of cinema ever done. This is a weird-wild-bloody-insane-etc poece of Japanese trash cinema along the lines of Fudoh-Versus-The Story Of Ricky-the guinea Pig films andf so on. Pretty much its like watching an anime done live action. Its so over the top it cannot be taken seriously. Many people bash it for being so outrageous but thats the fun of it. Its supposed to be completely insane. I highly recommend this film especially to fans of Dead Alive-Fudoh-Dead Or Alive-The Story Of Ricky-Wild Zero and Versus. It fits nicely into the little genre known as ""splatstick""!",positive
"Okay, you have a strange story twist; so the movie is a little better than your average kung fu movie. BUT, and this is a big BUT... The quality of the effects is so bad, so over the top that it quickly becomes a flashback to all the old kung fu movies from the past with spurting blood. I don't mind evil in a movie and I don't mind violence. But this one takes such cartoonish takes on violence that it just comes off as silly.Example... it doesn't take a genius to know that when someones juggler veins are cut the lights go out in the brain, they don't walk or stumble around. And if someone is completely cut in half from head to crotch they don't walk, they don't talk, they just die.",negative
"I've seen reviews that talked about having to turn this film off every 20 min to catch their breath, how it's gag inducing, or the hardest film they ever watched. I ate dinner while watching this. It is not a cinematic masterpiece. It's simplistic, dumb, and show almost none of the violence people talk about. The most violent thing in the film is a girl that accidently gets her throat cut and bleeds out. I have seen films way more violent than this. For crying out loud kill bill is more violent. 99% of the violence in this film is simply implied or all you see is a bit of the aftermath. What is the big freaking deal with this film. There is nothing overly deep here. I expected way more than a guy with 2in blades in his shoes somehow slicing people in half. The film isn't the stylistic masterpiece it's made out to be. If this is a 7 on style scale then Crank is an 11 it has infinitely more stlye the story is just as bad. The hype around this film is dumb.",negative
"You gotta be grateful to the god that Japanese nation exists on the planet, so one of them can create such a shocking movie and rest of us can watch it with one eye closed. You can't be mediocre about this movie, either you hate it so much that can't express or love it so much so you go and start watching other Takeshi miike's work. I would wanna find out how far this man's imagination can go so off we go.",positive
"It's definitely not my type of movie, but I think it's quite good. The plot is complicated so you're forced to pay attention (which is hard when you're cringing from the violence all the time.) After living with Ichi and Kakihara for over an hour, I do have a sense of feeling for both characters, which is quite an achievement since they are both incredibly despicable. It reminds me of ""Red Dragon"", where the Tooth Fairy and Hannibal Lecter want to meet, so one or the other will get consumed. Things don't exactly turn out that way, but that just serves to emphasize how Japanese ends their stories and how Westerners like to end it (tied up neatly with a bow).",positive
"I finished this movie with firm intentions of punching the TV set in. And this is the only time it has happened. Takashi Miike is the John Woo of splatter cinema whereas John Woo uses unlimited ammunition in guns while Miike distributes blood by the gallon.The only thing going for this film was the incredible plot and genius storyline. Let's see, a bullied child who is just as sick as the bullies and a sado-masochistic Yakuza boss who likes receiving pain as much as he loves to distribute it.Apart from that, this movie is sh!t. No redeemable characters. Every single person in this movie is an a$$hole and deserves to die. There is nothing to be learned from in this film except for the fact that killing could be a fun thing to try out.I don't know if the Japanese love this stuff, but unrealism really takes a lot out of this film. A guy getting cut right in half by a tiny blade in a guys shoe...wow. It was almost laughable.I think this movie could have been better without Miike at the helm. He just over does it, and for fear of backlash, gives us a happy ending.The target audience for this film is probably the 13-17 year old people who get off on extreme violence.All in all, I'd say Man Bites Dog (C'est arrivé presque chez-vous) before giving this trash a try.",negative
"This movie is totally disturbed.It is only for disturbed people who want's to see a ridiculous story, blood and gore every minute, sadism and all other crazy things.I bought this dvd and thought it would be something good, but it was soooo bad that I throwed it right after watching the movie. That's right i watched the whole movie, but after viewing 15 minutes I decided to watch it as a study to how sick a man could be to make this kind of movie.Just this makes the whole movie bad: A homosexual sado-masochistic mafia boss who loves to self torture himself by cutting of his own tongue and putting needles into his ears.Some people speek of takashi miike like he was some genius. Geniuses don't make this crap.I give this 0/10.",negative
"This is surely one the best film I ever seen this year. It's not common to see such a exploding violence like this, sliding into the pure beauty... Yes, cause this is film that talk 'bout the Total Beauty,about a Love too great to be known by tha human being (and the human body). Kakihara is a unique characters in the history of world cinema a lonely man with a personal point of view of what is love and what is pain; he is not living and he is not dead he's the extreme Don Juan for the 21st century.Ichi is the pulsating desire, he is the distructive side of sex even if he is not controlling himself. Kakihara and Ichi are the couple of dancer in a ballet of life and death, sickness and beauty.",positive
"I had high expectations of 'Ichi The Killer' when I purchased it on DVD but having subsequently watched it I have to say my overriding feeling is that the film is overrated. The mystique surrounding this film is wholly misplaced. It wasn't particularly well made (I personally thought the film looked cheap) and, due to the excess gore throughout, distinctly lacking in tension. The only strong point of the film was the sadist 'Kakihara'. A genuinely evil person, the potential for his character is never fully realised and the possible stranglehold he could have had on both the movie and the viewer is lost. Dripping semen, entrails, a man being sliced in half down the middle, these things didn't shock me in the slightest, the project's comic book origins are palpable and I feel the film suffers as a result. If this was Miike's intention then that is fair enough but the film is billed and advertised as being something entirely different to it's reality. 'Visceral' and 'ground-breaking' this is not. The biggest let down is the 'mysterious' character of Ichi who turns out to be a baby-faced, timid, emotional wreck. His character's confusion and angst is well portrayed but he is in many ways a complete disappointment, once again due to what you thought he was going to be not matching the reality. The movie isn't even visually striking (as i mentioned it looks quite cheap), aside from some interesting camera-work at the start which for me simply emerged as a metaphor for the film itself, a disappointing false promise.",negative
"Frenetic, hyperkinetic hommage to Seijun Suzuki(Branded to Kill) and Shohei Imamura(Vengence is Mine) employs innovative amalgam of edgy cinema to deliver an outrageously twisted Yakuza/Superhero genre hybrid.Boasting solid perfs and surprisingly well developed central characters, this odd foray into the psycho-sexual works as both off-the-wall cult item and stylized spoof all the while threatening to seduce us, through slick, smart, highly skilled filmmaking, into believing that it's brilliance is merely accidental.",positive
"Ok, so it's not for everyone. Probably not for most people. However, I found it to be well worth the effort.It is clear that 'western society' has pushed political correctness to the point where western directors don't push the envelope for fear of the backlash. Look at the uproar of the latest Mel Gibson epic featuring his view of the last hours of Christ's life. With so many groups wanting people to pander to them, it is no wonder that directors follow the yellow brick road painted by 'the studio's'. Well done for trying Mel!However, I digress. ICHI is not politically correct. It pushes the limits for violence to the extreme and a little beyond. This movie could not EVER have been made in any western country. Sure, it does not show highly sexual images like is somewhat common in the 'art house flicks' seeping out of France and other European countries; showing that culture defines acceptability almost as much as the 'pressure groups' do. If you like your movies violent with a raw feel to them ICHI is well worth seeking out. Be wary of the trimmed cuts including the unrated versions that are also cut. While still extreme, the true 'uncut' version is a marvel to behold!!! This is really not a date movie. It is more likely to cause your date to vomit and question 'the real you'. On the other hand, if it works as a date movie ----- probably time for a new date! Or maybe not....",positive
"Ichi the killer is a wild ride into the darkest Japanese streets. When a Mob Boss disappears the leaderless gang wants answers. The gang is wondering why their boss is missing, plus a large amount of money that vanished with him.This give's the gang a driving force and motive to take extremes. Who is to blame? And that is the question. The gang is disliked by so many other gangs it could be anyone. As the vengeful gang tortures, kills, and dismembers who ever gets in there way, hoping they can bring their kidnapped boss back to their gang.Ichi the Killer is a little different from most Japanese horror films. Movies like Audition and Reincarnation are great and very suspenseful but moves at a slow pace. You really have to pay attention to understand them.Ichi The killer really pushes the gore to the extreme. Some of the scenes will really get under your skin and make you squirm. Lots of fast pace action that will keep you in the movie.",positive
"I bought this on DVD and although it was cut by over 3 minutes I thought it was amazing. The film was very stylish and I thought the violence wasn't as bad as I expected but maybe because that is due to the violence being very comic. Even though I have not seen all of Miike's I have to say this is my favourite out of the ones I have seen. Kakihara has to be one of the best movie characters in film history. I will be looking out for Miike's films in the future and I can not wait to see 'Gozu'. I strongly recommend this film but some people may find the violence unsettling but those who like blood, guts, pain etc should watch it.",negative
"Japan, in the early 2000s, had undeniably become a significant leader in the production of niche, cult films, many of which juggle with bizarre, twisted and just plain extreme concepts and ideas. Very often characterized by its extreme violence, that « new » Japanese cinema usually pushed the boundaries of disturbing imagery beyond anything you could possibly see in a North American film. Director Takashi Miike is an iconic figure of this genre, seemingly trying to push the limits in the depiction of bizarre violence the he established himself, via a volume of films that would put to shame even the most prolific B-Movie directors of the 90s. One can think of Audition (which is probably the only Miike film that I've seen and liked), Visitor Q and Dead or Alive, but the most obvious example is undoubtedly Koroshiya 1, also known as Ichi The Killer.Miike takes the viewer to contemporary Tokyo, where different clans of Yakuza are at war. We learn that the head of the Anjo clan mysteriously disappeared with a large sum of money. Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), the heavily scarred right hand man of the missing gangster (and a true lover of sadomasochism), took the head of the clan in order to find his beloved master. However, his unorthodox interrogation methods and aggressive temperament create tensions with other Yakuza clans. It is then that we discover the real person responsible for the kidnapping and other carnage, a man named Ichi, psychologically controlled by a former clan leader who retired and who made him believe that he was persecuted by bullies throughout his youth.Does following that plot seem like a daunting task? It actually is, yes (and imagine how worse it gets when you have to read subtitles). Trust me, many details complicate the whole story unnecessarily. Especially given that, at the end of the day, the script is nothing more than an excuse for bloody and brutal scenes. Although the original idea came from a manga by Hideo Yamamoto, the script adaptation of this one, courtesy of Sakichi Satô, is quite sloppy at times. The intentions here are absolutely unclear, namely whether this is a meaningless, excess-driven show of bloodied up gut baths and necks turned into blood geysers or, rather, a reflection on the love man has for pain and self-destruction, however subtle the latter may possibly be. Whatever this film initially had to say, it gets lost in an exaggerated appetite for macabre, at the expense of proper storytelling. Don't get me wrong, I like mindless entertainment for the sake of entertainment. This film, however, is heavily punctuated with lengthy and messy story developments that feel like a failed attempt at giving this gallery of carnage a deeper meaning. I found the overall entertainment value of Miike's film to be moderate at best.The main qualities of ""Ichi the Killer"" lie mainly in the aesthetic department. First of all, the cinematography makes the whole experience feel like a live comic book. Great lighting, textures, and shadows. The direction also has its moments, despite a certain rarity in extravagant camera movements. The credits scene in the beginning of the film in particular, as well as one of the scenes in the Yakuza offices, are put together very well. But again, that is purely in terms of aesthetic value, as it never engenders anything that drives the overall narrative. It's all style, no substance. And to anyone with a taste for competent special effects, please note that this film has some good practical effects, but also over-the-top CGI gore that looks absolutely awful, and plenty of it.Let's just say that, overall, this is a confusing mess that is way too focused on provocation. When it was released, many called this a ""cult classic"" and many were very enthusiastic about Miike, calling him a ""master"" already. I disagree. Years have now passed, and Miike has over a hundred credits as a director. I haven't seen any of his films in recent years, but I assume that he has since matured as an artist. Hopefully he has, because ""Ichi The Killer"", at least in my mind, felt like a catalog of grotesque and gruesome in which everything else is gravitating filler, from a film maker that should have focused less on volume, and more on quality. Oh, and less on the messy delivery of shock value, and more on actual storytelling, too.",negative
"This is a seriously FUN film. My husband and I found ourselves laughing our asses off while alternately cringing. This film is shocking, twisted and at the same time clever, self-aware, stylish and extremely comedic. What's not to like? I highly recommend this film for lovers of splattergore and Asian shock film. You'll laugh, you'll cry...you'll hurl! The antagonists are often as despicable and synonymously lovable as the protagonists in this film. No lines are drawn as to who is right or wrong...all the characters bear their own crosses and harbor their own maladies and neuroses. The soundtrack is also quite interesting...quasi-industrial style music.",positive
"A pretty mediocre action, gore movie. Pretty ridiculous in premise (A super hero who goes nuts when reminded of his non role in a rape, pretty goofy). But the reason I was so intrigued by this movie was because everyone said it was so shocking and disturbing. Not the case. I was expecting gore along the lines of Dead Alive or Riki-Oh and what I got was a movie that wasn't even on par (in terms of sheer gore)with saving Private Ryan. The tempura oil scene was okay but other than that, it's all been done and done better. This was my first Mike movie and I wasn't as impressed with his work as some of the art house college students who regularly post on this site (they probably say they like these kind of movies just because very few people have seen them and they look like a semi cultured film fan by just mentioning the name of a foreign film in a conversation). I will give his work another go with something like Audition but if that one fails me I will have no interest what so ever in any of this guys other work.",negative
"I've seen Visitor Q some years ago and it shocked and deeply disturbed me,though I have seen a lot of gore and horror flicks before. I must say, that I am not a gore-fan. I just like to watch good movies, if there's gore in it or not is not important to me.Now I have seen Koroshiya 1 / Ichy the Killer and it was not as surreal as VQ, but at least as disturbing as first mentioned one. It definitely IS an extremely well and intelligently done movie, but it also is one sick, repulsive and deeply cruel flick, beyond any moral borders, top notch perverted twisted sick as *&^%$£$%. The weird thing is, it's probably the first movie where I wanted to throw up and pml at the same time (I am not sure if this can be seen as a quality feature ...). It's a really well told story, too. But things like the killing of the boy or the girl (who got raped) ... that's beyond any morality, that's just sick, though it surely is filmed from an Asian perspective on things (with other values...don't want to say that Asian's kill little boys and rape crying girls before slaughtering them...just the completely different point of view on things when doing a movie adds a whole lot of weirdness to Asian films when being watched by a westerner). I also know it's wrong to ask for human values in a movie like this, but it really hurts watching anyway.I feel somehow twisted now.",positive
"Crazy characters, insane story line, and enough blood to make anyone feel pale. It was still great to watch even while being dubbed in english by germans so every guy in the movie sounds like arnold.  Very fun quick paced film, i'm very glad i had it shipped over seas so i could see it.",positive
"Koroshiya 1 [Ichi The Killer] is complete immoral perfection. Unlike Miike's other films, such as Audition, Visitor Q, or even Dead or Alive, there is somewhat of a moral structure in them. But in Ichi The Killer, the sense of morals (however limited they might be in his other movies) is completely gone. Every character is tremendously unlikable, but for some reason, every character is UNFORGETTABLE. Some of the scenes might be too much for some people to take, but everything in this movie is unforgettable; from the characters (as I said previously), to the story, to the violence, to Miike's hyperkinetic style of filming, to even the sparse music -- nothing about this movie will leave your mind. This movie is Takashi Miike's best, and will stand as one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Highly recommended.",negative
"I have watched films such as Braindead (Peter Jackson), Battle Royale and have thought to myself, ""man this is extreme!"", yet I came upon this beauty, Ichi the Killer, which is far more disturbing that the both of those!          However, do not expect this film to be a gore fest, as it isn't, more of an exploration of sadism, masochism and the underworld of the world it has created.  I found this film great because although it was mind numbingly nasty, it had buckets of dark humour in it, what with the in depth characters, who have a secret or two of their own that is explored in this movie.   The cinematography is great, as is the direction, which is fast, furious, almost as if it is on drugs itself!  The acting is good too, especialy from Tadanabu Asano, who is great.       Take this film with tongue firmly in cheek, as it shouldn't be taken seriously, as it has lashings of gore, great dark humour and strangely intresting characters, who demand your attention.

"A lot of people might consider this movie as a shocker, as nothing more than hyper-violent garbage made for no other purpose than to make people upset and angry. But if you think so you have missed the whole point of the movie!It´s supposed to be FUNNY to watch, and it is! That might sound a bit sick to say since there are several rapes in it, but the rape scenes aren´t in there to glorify rape or anything, they´re in there to show what f***ed-up characters we are watching! And so are the torture scenes. Everything is so over the top in this movie that you can´t help but just laugh at it all!And as director Takashi Miike said; the gory stuff is supposed to look cartoonish and silly, it isn´t supposed to depict violence realistictly, and the movie isn´t supposed to make somekind off statement in any way. It´s simply supposed to give you one hell of a thrill, and it does. So therefore I think that you may call this movie a dark-comedy more than a shocker! Couse even in its bloodiest moments it´s quite hilarious. The cutting of the tounge for example is just brilliant comedy!The actors definetly got the point of the movie and did wonderful work as a result. Tadanobu Asano as Kakihara totally steals the show (the way Kakihara is introduced into the movie has got to be one of the coolest presentations of a character of all time)!So don´t look at this movie as if it was your average blood-soaked shocker but look at it as a very dark-comedy, because that´s what it is! And a great one too! Miike is one of our times greatest!10/10",negative

"Wow, I certainly didn't know what was waiting for me when I decided to watch this movie... I'd like to think I'm generally hardened, I like horror video games, movies, even read some mangas like Berserk and Junji Ito's horror mangas but wow this movie was a bit too much for me.Never have I seen such a divisive public when it comes to a movie like this, some people don't like it and some people praise it. I really understand both sides. In fact I first came to know about this movie through a book called ""1001 Movies to see before you die"" and this movie was amongst them, I really don't remember what was the reasoning for it being there but I can understand in some sense why. This movie is relentless, like every scene that you expect the director to not show the explicitness the director shows it- sometimes I wonder if such violence is needed? Perhaps as a means to not deter from the original vision of where it came from I.e. A manga? With drawings you can stylise violence, make it into a part of the aesthetic of your story and I think that Takashi Miike wanted to do something similar with this and show everything just like in the mangas. Honestly one would believe the scenes involving the titular Ichi would be the most terrible ones because he commits the most gruesome murders ever but since his character and his suit and the way he kills his victims are done in such an overblown cartoonish way it is hard to show it done without it looking very fake with CGI and stuff, unless you want to spend a lot on practical effects which Takashi doesn't so most of the killings Ichi does luckily are mostly implied or not shown a lot in contrast to Kakihara who does drawn out painful torture scenes, these were the ones that I wanted to look away from and had to cover my eyes even! Never have I ever encountered something like this before. It is also interesting how it tries to show different sides of violence from different points of view, both equally brutal.Violence aside I think this movie oozes style, it has cool camera placements and editing that is really frantic... but I think this film excels the most in how it captures it's characters, the costuming is brilliant- Kakihara's wardrobe is so bright and colourful which is a joy to watch (who's the designer?), same with everyone else on the cast, it is a joy (but also a fright) to see everyone imbue their characters with such effervescence.A negative of this movie I guess is that the story isn't conveyed really well? Some plot points, motivations and relationships in characters weren't done well enough- which is also the difficulty in adapting a manga to a live action movie cause in the manga you'll always have the advantage of having pages and pages to develop everything. I had to read a summary just to understand what was going on and why some characters did some stuff in the movie. This is also a negative side of the hyperactive and stylistic cutting of the movie, sure it looks very cool but it might confuse more than lead on. Also the ending is a bit confusing, make sure to read the wiki to understand it lol! But as I understood it it's a cycle of violence that repeats itself and that revenge never pays no matter how you do it.Would I watch this movie again? I don't think so really, maybe look at images of the characters to take inspiration for costuming and such but otherwise I couldn't stomach it- even watching it this time I had to take breaks from watching it and cuddle with my dog before I could see the rest of it. Make sure to watch this with someone because going at it alone is not something I recommend. It made me feel and that is what art is supposed to do, it wasn't pleasant feelings but nevertheless it made me feel, and for that I applaud it. Takashi Miike is brave for doing this but I certainly hope that I won't have to watch anything like it again cause wow this was certainly something different. As I said, I understand why it is appreciated but I also understand why it is hated.",positive
"Ichi the Killer seems to have this reputation as a very violent and disturbing film, and I don't understand this. I hadn't really looked into really violent and gory films before, so I never considered this, I thought that for the time being it might be a bit too extreme for my tastes. Then someone told me it was actually presented in a strange and funny way, so I thought I'd try it, and it isn't really at all difficult to watch.""Ichi"" is first and foremost a comedy. Yes, it's obviously black humour, but after watching this film the words that I think of are silly, completely over-the-top and fun. At the beginning a woman is seen being raped with blood covering her face, and I was all set for a gruesome and and disturbing film, but that isn't at all what the film is like. Whenever Ichi kills anyone blood spurts out of them in a hilarious, over the top fashion, and it's clear that this film really isn't meant to be taken seriously.This was the first film I watched from Takashi Miike. I had heard so much about this director and the way he comes up with strange images and ideas, and that's certainly the case in this film. The whole film has this feel to it which is difficult to explain, but wacky would probably sum it up. A lot of things in ""Ichi"" feel like they're straight out of a dream (or nightmare), very surreal and strange.I do think that this film is well made and quite intelligent, aside from all the surreal images. The characters are well defined, Kakihara as the cool gang leader who likes torturing people with hooks, knives and boiling water, and Ichi as the brutal killer who also happens to be a cry baby and all round loser. Like the gore which is over-the-top and ridiculous, the characters are also exaggerated. Both Ichi and Kakihara are pretty much complete weirdos, but that's what makes the film so fun to watch, everything about it is just so strange.I'd like to say that I'd recommend this to everyone, but I recognise that it's probably a love it or hate it kind of thing. Ichi the Killer is hardly a perfect movie, but don't expect it to be a disturbing and gruesome film. It's a strange film which manages somehow to make everything, from someone's arm being pulled off to a tongue being cut out with a knife, hilarious. If you like the sound of it, check it out.",positive

"This is probably the 3rd best movie I've seen of Takashi Miike after""Audition"" and ""The happiness of..."" I have never been keen on thisjapanese director (and I don't think I will ever be, for that matter) butI think I am finally beginning to understand him. ""Ichi..."" must notbe seen as a serious attempt to portray the violence of yakuzagangs of anything like that or maybe as an attempt to break newground as an extremely violent movie. The thing is that this is ahardcore manga taken into the big screen. Yes, there is a lot ofcruel violence but it is shown with a great deal of humor and that iswhat saves this movie. I like the character of ichi, it makes themovie look more interesting. To my mind, ""Audition"" & ""The happiness of..."" remain by far thebest films of Miike. My vote for ""Ichi"" is 6 out of 10.",negative
"Ichi is a video game-obsessed simpleton, hypnotized by policeman Anjo into believing that the Yakuzi used to bully him at school. Convinced he is a superhero who must liberate the world of bullies, Ichi kills several of the gangsters by copying Tekken maneuvers(!). Yakuza deputy Kakihara anticipates his impending death by Ichi (he is disillusioned with life and stuff!), hoping it will be the ultimate sadomasochistic thrill; naturally, he is disappointed to discover that Ichi isn't 'the ultimate killing machine' as the horrific deaths of his friends may suggest but a brainwashed thickie.Director Miike attempts to add a respectable, moral message to Hideo Yamamoto's original story with the suggestion that Kakihara's foolish fear of Ichi is a comment on society's fear of the unknown (or something). Unfortunately, he seems to retire this notion after the first 30-minutes, apparently safe in the knowledge that his disturbed fans will be too aroused by the various scenes of disembowelment to care about any meaningful allegories.The story's misogyny is uncomfortable but merely a consequence of the laughable homoeroticism that is currently so rampant in Japanese pop-culture, while the notorious violence is mostly rendered in CGI and ridiculously exaggerated, thus unlikely to disturb (unless you found Mortal Kombat 2 on the Megadrive a traumatic experience). Thankfully, each character has a unique look and personality (no 'who is who' oriental confusion); indeed, Asano Tadanobu's masochistic Kakihara is far more entertaining than Ichi himself.Unfortunately, the relentless pace and weird twists soon become tedious despite Miike's often absurd efforts to maintain interest. At over two-hours, Ichi The Killer is ideal for anyone who desires to know what it is like to be trapped in a hellish nightclub with the worst migraine ever.",negative
"The thing that anyone sitting down to watch Ichi the Killer needs to know is that yes its violent but takashi Miike doesn't take everything seriously. Many of Miike's more over the top violent movies have a comic aspect to them. They are ridiculously silly as well as being violent.Ichi is really two stories, the story of a shy quiet whipping boy who seeks revenge for the abuse he and others have taken. Then there is the story surrounding a missing Yakuza boss and his henchman who goes to outrageously violent extremes to find/avenge his missing boss. This henchman is a sado masochistic psycho path who stops at nothing to accomplish his task.This movie is certainly not for everyone but it is typical of Miike's work. Not as blatantly light hearted at happiness of the Katakaris or as dark as Audition but fulfilling for fans of Japanese gore and action films.",positive
"I'm a huge fan of Asian cinema for it's audacity, visual inventiveness, humor, and action. While plenty violent, and occaisonaly funny, Ichi The Killer doesn't have much else going for it. I personaly found it extremely difficult to sympathize with a single character, and found the constant focus on sadism, with no attempt to explore the theme in any other way than show it, to be quite tiresome.
The pacing really bogs down the the second act as it explores the twisted but boring life of Ichi. 3 out of 10",negative
"The movie is quite good but it builds the female character as an inanimate object and many scenes are too sensitive.Other than that, there are a lot of quality scenes and some that aren't really great but overall it's a weird movie to experience.",negative
"Ichi the Killer is a disjointed story about a man (Jiji) who pits two Yakuza gangs, who have a tentative allegiance, against each other, while at the same time training Ichi, a shy and borderline dysfunctional man to ""fight back"" against the ""bullies"". It eventually builds up to a climactic rooftop scene where Ichi, who does not want to hurt anyone, has to fight the ""villain"" Kakihari, who wants someone to inflict pain on him. It features a quasi-surrealist ending (which I will get back to in a second).The main disappointment of this movie was how the story was told. Instead of showing the growth of Ichi and Kakihari side by side, director Takashi Miike decided to have most of the first half dedicated to Kakihari and the gangs, and most of the second half dedicated to Ichi, completely changing the pace of the movie and throwing the viewer for a loop. Characters that seemed important at first disappear, and ones that seemed totally minor suddenly become vital.In addition, after the movie, the viewer is left wondering what is the point. Miike does nothing to actually make you care about any of the characters, and so you could care less whether Ichi kills Kakihari or vice versa. The ending, where Kakihari apparently imagines Ichi killing him and jumps off a roof is such a cop-out that it will have you shaking your head. Showing an older Takahashi (the son of an oft-ridiculed Yakuza member) walking away from a tree where Jiji is hanging with a group of school kids is even sillier.It's almost as if Miike couldn't decide whether Ichi the Killer would be a bloody drama or a black comedy. He presents it as the former, but the ridiculous torture and bloodshed, as well as the strained dialogue and confusing ""flashbacks"", make it impossible not to be laughing out loud half the time. The viewer feels no sympathy for Ichi, laughing at him instead, and the scenes with the randomly English-speaking women were absolutely ridiculous. It just leaves one with the feeling of ""Who cares?"" Not all is bleak, however, as there were some positive elements here. The characters, of which there were many, were all distinctive and easy to tell apart, a feat considering how the story is told. I specifically enjoyed the two detectives, who often moved in sync and had a very quirky approach towards their jobs (to say the least). In addition, there was some nice cinematography at times. For example, the scene where Kakihari is kicked out of his gang and he decides to take over the Anjo gang is very well shot. The soundtrack works perfectly as well.Overall, you will probably laugh a lot at this movie, and you will certainly be entertained, but it is not a ""good"" film.",positive
"Ichi The Killer is easily one of the most grotesque gory films of history, along with Miike's other trachea trembling film, Audition.Ichi is simply a killer who desperately needs to brutally murder people with his bladed shoes in order to feel pleasure, but the bad thing is he couldn't help it. He killed the boss of Kakihara, a sadistic, pain-loving gangster who does many shocking favors to others such as being beaten and the infamous on-screen tongue cutting scene.Ichi The Killer is filled with things that a Miike fan wants. Guts, Gore, One-Liners, Violence, Torture, Violent Rape, and Nudity. All these on-screen elements create a true gore-fest from Miike along with many relatively unknown actors.The only disadvantages I had was the odd plot, because it was hard to describe from the film to your head. Also, The film is not safe to watch, at all. It can easily make you give up watching the whole film despite the mixture of realistic torture and over-the-top murders.Would Kakihara able to defeat the violent Ichi as an honor to his deceased boss? Find out by yourself, I can't spoil the ending. It's a completely shocking ending and it's totally worth the blood.",positive
"This is not a movie at all!The idea of an action/horror movie is that there are some ""good"" guys and some ""bad"" guys. Sometimes the baddies win, most times the goodies win... There is a plain reason for this: it creates some kind of a struggle. ""Ichi the killer"" features only bad guys, which makes this film totally pointless.But this is just the first reason to avoid this one: another would be that the action sequences are all very lame, the horror parts are truly pathetic. Combine this with a lack of a story and you'll have ""ichi the killer"". Makes you wonder why Ichi didn't kill the producing cast as well, that at least would have put an end to this waste of time.One last point: the guy starring ""Ichi"" can't act!My conclusion: utter and total crap! 3 out of 10Regards,",negative
"What I don't understand is if your trying to convert a manga into live action why try and create a cartoon effect by using computer effects for the violence and gore?  Why adapt it at all if your gonna make it look like a cartoon.  I felt some of the shock factor was lost due to the bad computer effects.  When ever Ichi massacres many people in a room its never shown, which I find odd as this is a film with a very violent nature yet seemed to avoid opportunities to show off the extreme nature of the film.  At one point you just see a doorway and computer generated (badly done) blood and bits of meat fly through the door way.  The end is a hell of a disapointment as the film builds up to a fight between the ultimate sadist and the ultimate massachist which ends in mere seconds and once again avoiding any real shocking violence.  I would reccomend watching at least twice before making up your mind as character development happens rather late in the film and so the first part of the film is like watching an episode half way through a series and not knowing whats going on.  Ultimately I think this had alot of potential wasted due to the directer who I'm not much of a fan of after seeing dead or alive 1+2.",positive
"Junk...pure and simple. Nothing coherent or remotely interesting, poor characterisation (which is a sin for a manga adaptation) and violence solely for the sake of violence - never a positive thing in a film, if you ask me. I have absolutely no problem with screen violence at all - in fact the more gory it is, the happier I normally am - but it has to serve the story. That is simply not the case here. Random bloodletting and raging sadism will never take the place of story led violence. All in all, I have to say I was mightily let down by this movie. I've enjoyed much of Takashi Miike's past work - especially the truly awesome 'Audition', but this just didn't hit the spot. Don't believe the hype.",negative
"That is the only way to describe this movie, Ichi takes us past the limit. Know why? One scene in the film has a man hung up on 16 hooks and being insanely tortured, and what puts it over the top is: a small drip of blood. That's it that one drop of blood is a signal of how crazy the film is... You see i only noticed the blood on my third viewing but it was there. It did'nt need to be there, no one would miss it, but it was! and that what makes this so good. While also the characters are stupendous, the gore is great(with one exception) and KAkihara is the type of cool that is up there with Ash, Hell Boy, and Prisoner csk2-303. Great movie check it out. Not for the weak of heart. or the week of stomach.",positive
"Takeshi Miki a cult Japanese director this was always on the watchlist, also based on a manga series it was bound to be a good watch.I heard beforehand it was a gore fest, but as an avid horror watcher it wouldn't be a problem. Also this movie isn't actually a horror, its based on rival Yakuza gangs in Japan.The basic storyline Is gang boss Anjo has fled with a prostitute and millions of yen. His sadomasochistic henchman Kakihara along with fellow gang members are on the hunt for him. They capture rival gangster Jiji and torture him to reveal whereabouts but to no avail and release him. Unbeknown to them Jiji has been manipulating Ichi a young man with great skills into murdering, and now he is after Kakihura and the other gang members.Gore at its finest. This movie explores the lengths of what gangsters do to find out the truth and cut of people as quickly as you can say that",negative
"I do not walk out of movies on a regular basis, especially not ones that I have gone to great lengths to purchase. Ichi the Killer proves to be the exception.Admittedly, I do not often watch violent gore-fest movies like this, unless they have a redeeming philosophic outlook. (ie Battle Royale) However the treatment of women in this movie was detestable. While the characters were from the underside of society, most, if not all, of the women were portrayed as masochistic whores asking to be beaten. Bad enough was the way they were treated by the men, but it was disgusting to see every main female character asking for more pain as they were being abused by their men.Yes, many of the male characters seemed to be rather masochistic as well, but they had the power. Even when one character was being beaten by a women, he was the one instructing her and egging her on. She was doing his will, and it was obvious that at any moment he could have complete control of her.Perhaps I could have watched it through if there had been some strong female role within the movie, but even so --one must be ready for extreme violence and sexually disturbing images.",negative
"Not a bad movie, but after reading all the hype I expected one kick ass movie.  NOPE, cool movie but not worth running out to see and the violence is not as bad as reviews lead you to believe.  Check out Audition or Visitor Q.  Better films by the same director but once again, don't let reviews lead you to think you are in for a total gross out.",positive
"i'm always hyping up movies in my head which i should never really do being a movie lover. i ended up hyping up this movie when i it came out. i was really looking forward to get my hands on the DVD. i only gave this movie 5***** because it did not disappoint me. expectations are not always good but 'ichi the killer' gave me a new viewing pleasures if that does not sound dodgey. the reason i got into Japanese cinema when i was younger was because it gave me something new that wasn't effected by American influence. manga started off my interest in Japanese culture. i still like American movies when they offer something original. the latest American movie that is still stuck in my mind was 21 grams and it wasn't even a completely American movie.Takeshi Miike makes completely irregular films but his brilliance with ICHI and audition which are possible his most popular movies over in england, put him up as a influential director in Japan. he might have also made some bad movies but at the alarming rate he directs them, its not surprising.good acting, interesting (weird) characters, great plot, great directing and production all make this movie worth watching. you are likely not to enjoy this movie as much as i did so don't hype it up too much. it gets 5***** for its amazing originality. don't read any info on the plot or characters. just watch it and see what you think of it because i'm not ignorant enough to know that many people will disagree with this review if you have never seen this type of takeshi miike movie. this is a good place to start but it makes dead or alive 2 and 3 seem really rushed.don't hype it up and just sit d",positive
"Not only is there the comforting sense of mystery and 'WTF' is that, which is sadly lacking in most modern pop Amercan movies... but it provides a refreshing and altogether spurtingly great source of entertainment. Here we have boys beset by their own personal daemons of life and love and loyalty.. yadayadayada... common gangsta flick fare. I do appreciate the deep set pathos that is displayed. But... but... the shiny thing that sets this movie apart is the loving care taken to surprise and titillate the discriminating viewer. Many movies of the action genre are hurt by this 'less plot more killing' problem, or the action is done routinely and in a dull unimaginative sort of way. But here 'plot' and 'killing' weigh equally and artistically in this movie. Great advantage of digital technology too. Put the kiddies to bed and see it with someone you love.",positive
"It's easy to over-react to Ichi, but you have to remember that this is live action manga, with all the violence which that entails. Or entrails. It's also easy to say that the extreme violence, of which there is a LOT, is so over the top that it becomes almost humourous, but it's true. This is not a film that's going to keep you awake at night through fear because, quite simply, the ""horror"" is so unbelievable that it just ends up washing over you unless you're the kind of person who believes a deranged killer could break into your house and slice you in two with oversized ice skates.The real star of the show is the ""villain"" (assuming you can categorise any of the characters into good or bad), Kakihara. While Ichi causes more deaths, it's Kakihara that runs riot with inventive ways to kill bystanders or mutilate himself. A great bad guy because there's no doubting that he IS bad. Through and through.This is definitely not a film for the whole family to watch after Christmas dinner, but if you're a fan of manga, or Japanese films in general, it's well worth seeking out to see what's happening on the, literally, bleeding edge of Asian films.",negative

"I think Takeshi Mike could teach a thing or two to all these wannabe grind house film makers about how to make a thriller that is not only ludicrously violent and gory, but also humorous, quirky and intelligent. The film is literally a comic book come to life, but, It doesn't dwell constantly on violence and sexual violence to make its impact, like many other horror films do today. Whereas Hostel and saw try their hardest to be offensive and shocking simply because kids and young adults like it, This film doesn't feel like its trying too hard. Yes, I know I've blasted torture porn films in my other reviews, and this could be considered torture porn as well,but this film has more to offer then just torture and violence. The acting and script are pretty much fantastic, and the special effects are well done even though occasionally they look kind of artificial. Takeshi Mike has had a long career of making films that are not mainstream in any sense of the word,apart 13 assassins, but, I'm always eager to see his new films because they are always something new. Thumbs up to him for not being a one trick pony like Eli Roth, Quentin Tarantino or even Paul WS Anderson.",negative
"If you've ever wondered what kind of film could be made and distributed if the MPAA didn't loom over the shoulder of filmmakers, then look no further. This film opened my eyes to the possibilities of violent cinema. I was appalled when I saw ""Irreversible"", due to the extreme realism of the violence, but when I saw ""Ichi the Killer"" I was thrilled beyond belief. This film will find it's American fan base in those who love Kubrick, Tarantino, and Sam Peckinpaugh. A must see for those who love to see blood(gallons of it) and guts(piles of it). This film also contains an organized crime element that demonstrates one man's loyalty to his boss and to his fellow gangsters. Kakihara can be compared to Luca Brasi...with way better hair.",positive
"Only thing in the media you hear about Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" is that it has way too much blood and gore which most of the time end up in moral discussions about what should and what should not be censored in movies, in how sick Japanese cinema is ect ect. FORGET THE MEDIA; they're biased. Cast aside your prejudgements and take a look at the movie itself. Experience it, try to understand and DONT FOCUS ON THE GUTS FLYING AROUND.Story cut short: Ichi the Killer revolves about a psychopath Kakihara (beautiful role by Tadanobu Asano) who seeks (revenge for) his yakuza boss who suddenly has disappeared from his hotel room. In his search he gets a lead to Ichi, a manipulated psycho in service of another (ex?) yakuza person. Their paths cross and yes, it includes a lot of decapitation ect ect.The story might not be that new and not that great... but the best thing about Koroshiya 1 must be the characters. Every character has it's own remarkable charistics (sp?) which really gives you a look in the minds of those ... weirdos. Take a look at Ichi himself, at first glimpse he seems a perverted psychopath. Take a further look and you might discover that this psycho is in reality a tormented manipulated kid who is the great victim in the entire movie. Same with the cop-who-lost-his-gun (forgot his name), the entire movie he tries to prove himself loyal to boss Anyo but he doesn't get much attention from his peers what seems to really stress him out.But I ain't gonna give a full character review. Cast aside the bulls*** and see Ichi for yourself.8/10",positive
"SPOILERS ....I didn't feel Ichi The Killer to be as visceral as it's reputation. While that certainly doesn't mean it's not revolting or disgusting (I'll get back to that), it's visual representation of violence is hardly shocking enough to justify the kind of walk-outs you frequently here about (in a local sneak preview about half the audience - 110 people - 'ran in fear and disgust'). Why didn't the violence shock me head-on? First of all, much of it is obviously CG, like the infamous Hannibal climax. Second, much of it (though certainly not all) is played so much for laughs. And third, the gore's frequently repetitive, so much so that you'll be pretty desensitized by the end (by the third blood-erupting volcano of a throat you'll be too bored to even care). But beyond the simple fact that my stomach is apparently made of reinforced concrete, this is still a pretty shocking film, especially if you can derive actual enjoyment from it.The fake feel of certain effects and their repetitiveness doesn't change the fact that thinking this up and throwing it on the silver screen is a pretty sick idea. Indeed, Ichi The Killer is so sick in every aspect you kind of wonder what Miike Takeshi's idea was: is it just to see what today's audience will swallow? Is it his reaction to our pre-occupation with entertainment that panders to our dark sides? And the amount of blood and guts pervading the screen is just the beginning. This is not a mere splatter-film. Nor it is a black comedy. Staples of both genres are here in abundance, but Ichi The Killer is something different. Frequently, people have pointed out the film's misogynist view of women. And it's true, every single woman in this film appears in a sexually oriented (and brutally violent) scene. There isn't a woman with depth in the entire film. But wait, there isn't a man with depth either. While you may think of Ichi as a psychosexually disturbed man, it simply isn't so. His character is basically blowing up all those Japanese society cliches (the bullied child, the sexually repressed, the video game addict) to such ridiculous proportions you just can't take it seriously. In my opinion, it's Miike testing us further. First, we may think it's a story about a clearly psychotic murderer who has been manipulated into his actions, but then Miike pulls the rug from under our feet and we discover that Ichi was never bullied, he never witnessed a rape. A deep statement about the intrinsic sadism in everyone of us? You decide. Anyhow, Ichi isn't a character of any depth, he's just hypnotized and transformed into Jiji's chess piece. Kakahira is the yakuza figure blown up to epic proportions, he's the ultimate masochist but also a sadist for sure, but is he a character of any depth? And is the depiction of men any more rosy than that of women? Even the ex-cop is a revenge-obsessed idiot. I'm not trying to excuse the film's misogyny, I'm just pointing out it isn't very fond of the male gender either.And that's I think the ultimate joke the film's playing on us. It's a film that's full of unrealistic and unlikable characters. They are somewhere in a shadowy world between comic book idiocy and psychosexual insanity portrait. We can't feel for any of them, so we probably don't oppose their (gory!) deaths that much. Whether you take the events seriously or not (and you shouldn't, by the way), it's a film in which there is nothing to compensate for the escalating violence. And that is its point. It's there so I can't intellectualise my enjoying it like I can with most American violent films. It wants to desensitize you and for you to write on the IMDb it has some really groovy camera angles (and it does). By the end you won't care what Ichi will do to the group of school children he really shouldn't be escorting. It, however, is not hypocritical like, say, Gladiator, in that it doesn't supply the violence and tell you not to enjoy it at the same time. The point of this film is being bad and so violent you'll still sit through it. The fact that it wasn't the gore but the sick nature of its ideas is what made me stay probably doesn't point to just a really tough stomach after all. And people who leave before the ending turn out to be right.
Rating: 5/10 (because and despite of the fact I enjoyed it a lot)",positive
"Watching Ichi was a bad idea. This film brought me a week of nightmares!!! A really horrible, horrible film. I've read that Ichi is comics character and I was terrified how popular it seems to be. I like Asian films, I like horror films, but this one definitely is not one of them. Obviously I'm not aware of the genre. It is completely not understandable and I think that one's mind must be twisted to like it. When i saw it I wondered why these men are doing all of these things, what is the point, what do they aim? None could convince me that Ichi is some sort of hero. Usually superheros are double-minded, but this one hits the top. Usually Asian films are well filmed, even the stupid ones, but Ichi ""shines"" with silly storyline, bad director's work, absolutely meaningless violence and... whatever you may think of...",negative
"This is a disgusting Japanese movie. There are a lot of graphic torture and murder scenes, and I don't mean simple bullet in the head, but opening up people's bellies and letting the guts fall out with blood splashing all over the place. Hanging a guy on a few hooks was quite disgusting, but watching how they poured boiling oil on his skin was unbearable.The story is very stupid - a guy is manipulated to kill through his fear of bullies. Here's how the conversation goes: ""These guys are bullies, kill them!"" ""I don't want to kill anymore!"" ""If you don't do as I tell you, your dick will fall off!""Before I watched it, I thought it might be a Quenting Tarantino type movie with lots of blood and gore, but it was nothing of the sort. It was just awful, tasteless. DOn't watch it. Terrible!Don't spend money on this.",negative
"For those of you who have seen the Peter Jackson gut-fiesta, Ichi the Killer tries in the same way to add gore that will make you toss your cookies to a loose plot that doesn't have to be taken seriously. Unlike Dead Alive, Ichi's plot does deserve a second look. Set in modern day urban Japan, the movie offers a highly stylized (this is Asian cinema) look at modern Japanese gangs- (We learn they corrupt the police and rule with just as much authority), and pokes around a bit for answers to that age old question, Why in the world are some people so hell bent on torturing others? The recurring themes of bullies and sexual perversity are treated in the extreme and by the end there is little room left for semi-Freudian conclusions about motive: Kids who are bullied like to get off by causing pain. But I have not put this as delicately as I should have. Ichi is not heavy handed with it's characters and, without a bit of thought, (which is really an activity only for the hyper-analitical during this one...I mean, really, ya don't have to think about pop-psychology to enjoy flying cut-off faces splatting against the wall), one might never notice the depth and delicacy of backstory given to each person. It's only somewhere between wondering if you will ever flinch again and whether or not you will forget all your morals after seeing this film that you might think ""Why is Ichi a killer?"" At first glance, it's a tasteless (yet uber-chic!) story of gangsters, hookers and pimps that would make Quentin Tarantino or any horror movie fanatic giddy with excitement and any other average Joe wondering if they should be offended by the extreme violence, tastelessness and mysogony. But the second look really opens up some of the psyche behind all that, and that's the only thing that could ever help solve those problems. Condemning it certainly wouldn't do the job. Good job Miike!",positive
"Everything has been said about the extreme violence and sadism displayed in this film. The fact that many only talk of this violence is not not surprising, it is right in your face. This seems to have irritated some though. Contradicting a reviewer there is something else you could talk about this film apart from its violence and I'll try to do so. So whether you like it or not Ichi the Killer forms part of the yakuza genre and it will be study in Japanese film studies as a variation of this particular genre. Why?, because Miike (by the way pronounced Meeke) Takashi likes subverting and playing with genres conventions. Yakuza genre conventions are used in this film too but taken to radical extremes as for example the homosexual overtones of oyabun- kobun (father-child or senior-boss & junior) common in yakuza films. This kind of relationship is not at the same level as heterosexual relationships. Women cannot compete with the oyabun. In Ichi the killer this is made clear in the scene when Karen, the Hong-Kong Chinese prostitute and Kakihara's girlfriend, is trying to take up the role of Kahikara's boss by beating him up, but as Kahihara tells she is not as good as his boss, there is no love in her beating. Sado-masochist and homoerotic elements have always been implicit in yakuza films (take as example Takakura Ken series of Shin Abashiri Bangaichi). In Ichi the Killer these elements are the main drive of its narrative. Even though Ichi is far from being Takashi's best film I still felt intrigued by some of its elements. For example, why Karen speaks mainly in English. All Takashi's followers should know by now about his interest in Chinese culture and people. Several of his films were shot in China. Chinese is spoken in many of his films, Rainy Dog for example, shot in Taiwan, Chinese (Cantonese) is the main language in this film. Can Ichi's obsession with video games and being bullied at school (a common problem in Japan) explain the why of his violence?( this seems to be a pretty thin explanation though). More interesting and mysterious is the character played by Tsukamoto Shinya, Jijii, who manipulates Ichi into slaughtering rival yakuza. Jijii sets up CCTV cameras to show Ichi which guys he wants him to kill. As Ichi watches the monitor, Jijii sort of hypnotises him and convinces Ichi that those guys on the screen are actually the ones who bullied him in the past. Tsukamoto is himself a director of rather violent films too (Testuo I & II, Tokyo Fist...) Some reviewers have talked of not taking too seriously the violence in the film, as it is sort of comical. I wouldn't call comical the sequence where a rival yakuza played by Terajima Susumu hangs from meat hooks while Kakihara is torturing him. Notwithstanding the comical gory scenes Takashi cannot help but end the film with a bleak note. Ichi has been used for killing worthless yakuza and that maybe the reason why the director turns the killings into gory comedy. But once an innocent boy, the son of the policeman- turned-yakuza played by Sabu, is killed the mood changes. In the final scene of the film Jijii is seen hanging dead from a tree in the foreground and in the background Ichi following a group of schoolchildren ready, for what it seems, to slaughter them. Ichi has eventually found his real bullies: children not yakuza. After killing Sabu's character Ichi's beaten up (to Ichi's weak mind this could just be a re-enactment or reminder of his bullying paranoia)  by the boy. Ichi reacts by chopping his head off. Jijii realises that, this is just an assumption, he has created a monster. Takashi seems to be more sympathetic towards children than women (see for example DOA 2: birds). I'm a bit wary of Takashi's treatment of women on this film, something that some reviewers have already pointed out. I've been suspicious about this since I first saw Shinjuku Triad Society where a prostitute falls in love with the main character, a Japanese-Chinese policeman, who had previously anally raped her. The reason: nobody else had ever made her to come until then... Uhmm... Dodgy stuff... In an interview Takashi has said that the reason why he gets rid of women so violently and quickly is because women tend to rationalise everything and he's no time for providing a rational and coherent explanation for his films. Well, nobody is perfect.  Nevertheless Miike Takashi seems to be moving away from the straight to videos films (v-movies as they are called in Japan) he made on the first part of his career (all of them chinpira (wannabe yakuza) films rather than yakuza as I've been told). In the last 3 years he's done comedies, musicals, social satires, horror films and of course still yakuza movies. Let's see if his attitude toward women changes too.",positive

"Straight from the Manga, Mike's masterpiece explores connections between sadism and humour, violence and sex. Characters are unidimensional like the best comics tradition. Cinematography is stylish, classy and innovative, and all the actors are perfectly casted. Blood and torture scenes are extremely graphic. The end, as usual in Mike's movies, is a bit confusing and mysterious, and in this case, in my opinion, it damages the climax too much. But the surprise about Tsukamoto's role right before the end amuses the audience unexpectedly. If you have a strong stomach, you'll find it incredibly entertaining, and even funny in a really original way. If you haven't a strong stomach, avoid it.",positive
"Take what you love from graphic novels and manga , combine it with stylish directing , an uncompromising look into sadism and masochism and give it a solid foundation and plot and you have Ichi the Killer.The plot unfolds perfecty if a little disjointed which leads to questions and awnsers being given at just the right times , the acting is superb , and the characters have a surprising amount of depth as you explore their various psychological stances.this is more than a comic to film translation , its actually a masterpiece of the genre.i will suggest that the weak of heart stray away though , as the film does get pretty gritty dare i say creative(!)with its yakuza styled torture scenes.anyhow if your a fan of movies in general and have a fairly open mind to new genres i highly recommend this film!",positive
"Now, you always have to hand it to the japanese filmakers.  When it comes to onscreen violence, no other culture is as creative, brutal, and wierd like the Japanese.  Such is the case with Ichi the Killer, so much so in fact, that the story (or lack of it) is almost lost.  AS for the story, it begins with the dissapearence of a yakuza boss and a whole bunch of money.    So the new head of the yakuza Kakihara goes about the usual ruotine of finding out what happened by slowly torturing a rival yakuza underboss (if that what they are called).  This proves futile other than to show that they were being manipulated by the very person who told Kakihara that the underboss new somthing.  The manipulator, Jijii, doesnt stop, nor began, his manipulation with Kakihara, in fact, he is in complete control over one of the most bizarre killers in cinema history (in any culture) Ichi.  Not only is he completly oblivious to his real past, but so are we since its never fully explained.  All we know is what Jijii tells Ichi which is a whole bunch of lies about Ichi witnessing a rape and doing nothing.  What makes Ichi so bizarre is that he cries over everything (when we first see ichi, hes trying to make a decent living as a waiter, puked on a custumer, and then is crying about it).  He also cries right before, dring, and then after a kill as if hes both upset about his past (the rape memory) and of his present (being a killer).His only justification for what he does is that he is killing bullies.  Anyway, whjen Kakihara find out about Ichi, the story shifts from them trying to find out what happened to the Yakuza boss and more on Kakihara's fascination with Ichi (Kakihara has a huge fetish for pain, so much so, that he broke a relationship becuase his girlfriend could not inflict the right amount of pain on him).  This storyshift peads to what is quite possibly the most anticlimantic and strange showdown ever (lets just say theres more crying in this one scene than an entire liftime movie).
Now, the main reason why this movie is so infamously popular is becuase of its violence, of which, it is very deserving of such popularity.  It appears to mix the realistic violence of Irreversibe with old school horror violence, with a touch of new school horror violence as seen briefly in Freddy vs. Jason (a la CGI aided violence).  However, as mentioned earlier, the violence is very stylistic at times and inventive (key example being a face sliding down a wall).  Of course that is the new school horror violence.  The torture scens on the other hand, have the Irreversible touch. They are slow moving and dont cut away.  What makes the torture scens even worse is how much the torturer, kakihara, enjoys torturing his victums (in fact he surpasses pretty much every other character's limits with the violence he dishes out and takes).The most interesting aspect of the movie, however, would have to be the characters themselves.  Basically, there is not one character that anyone would really want to be associated with in anyway especially Ichi and Kakihara.  Both of them are equally screwed up in the head but in different ways.  One really enjoys pain way too much and the other cant function as a normal adult and is still very much an ignorant child who lashes out at people when things get tough.  You really want to feel sorry for Ichi but in the end you cant becuase, in the end, he seems to be beyond the point of help, not to mention that he himself in a very subtle way enjoys killing.Of course, being that its a japanese horror/action film, there are bits of humor that only the japanese would do like Kakihara cutting off the front of his toungue then take a call right after or a crooked (and screwed up) cop sniffing a womans crotch to find out where her lover is.All in all, if you are into japanese film, give it a try and you might be suprised.  I would also say that if you are into philosphy or psychology, it might be a good movie to check out becuase of Ichi and Kakihara.",negative
"Badass movie. BDSM, sadism, torture, mafia, yakuza, finally one of the most accessible Japanese movie for this kind of genre. Ichi is a freaky psychopath manipulated, despite his kid & shy looking he reacts like a heartless evil monster and kills with no limits or rules. Kakihara is damn ""swag"", pure masochist mafia boss who dreams of despair situations, only Ichi will give him the ultimate pain he's looking for. The story is really nice, and I strongly recommend you to read the original manga by Hideo Yamamoto which is clearly more gore than the movie. You're also welcome to see the OAV Anime to complete the knowledge of the story. And finally, you can fully enjoy the Original Soundtrack composed by Karera Musication who's a total blast. I have everything : Movie - Manga - OAV - OST > I'm a Koroshiya groupie ^^ Arigato.",positive
"Wow. What a weird flick. First of all, Im not all that familiar with Asian cinema, and the only other Miike film I've seen is Audition, which I love to death. Let me say that I definitely did enjoy Ichi. But this movie is one odd duck. I had to watch it twice in a row to understand what was going on, but after that second watching I think I understood most of it. (I still don't understand where the kid got the tongue from...wtf?) And the two main characters are some of the most unique I've seen in a long time. My biggest problems with the movie are Miike's fairly vague story structure, like flashbacks with no indication that you are watching a flash back can get fairly confusing. But the only thing I really disliked about it, and the reason my rating is not a 9 is his use of really obvious and bad CG for wounds and blood. Other than 1 or 2 things, his usage of CG was totally unnecessary. Almost everything could have been done with traditional effects, and they would have worked much better. Also, the level of blood when people were injured anywhere in the throat area. Not that the blood bothers me, but I just thought the movie would have been more effective with a more reasonably realistic amount of blood. But, that may be a stupid request of a film that is this off the wall. Overall, great flick if you can deal with the utter insanity of if. A truly demented film, but not as brutally violent as I expected. Oh, and since it seems to be compared to Oldboy a lot, Ill just say that I think Oldboy is easily the superior film. 7/10. Two severed thumbs up.",positive
"Ichi the killer is Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, and any other Tarantino movie on steroids, upping the violence, but with the cool characters reminding me of Tarantino. There are themes of sadomasochism which I could've lived without. The gore is akin to Kill Bill but there is also graphic torture and mutilation which probably would earn the film an NC-17 rating had it not been unrated. Kakihara is the coolest character in the movie, he's a bad ass and just an awesome character. Ichi is a crybaby who really is a sadistic, psycho path. It is a long movie and it does feel a little stretched out. I think it could be shorter and the ending as with Audition didn't make any sense and I was puzzled what had happened. Overall a pretty cool and gory movie not for the squeamish.",negative
"This movie is bizarre in a good way. The use of camera is amazing and out of the box. I was amazed with the way whole movie was shot. Some over the top killing, but may be that is how Mike wanted this movie to be made.",positive

"""Koroshiya 1"" (""Ichi the Killer"") is another one of Takashi Miike's classics. ""Koroshiya 1"" (""Ichi the Killer"") is a fantastic piece of cinema. It is hugely entertaining and will remain as cult classic forever! Sure its EXTREMLY violent/gory but its just comic gore and I myself found it funny. What I also find funny is, is the fact IMDb classed it as an adult film, Its nowhere near as lame as a PORN film I mean c'mon classing it as a porn film is just an insult I mean sure there are two just TWO oral sex scenes and one rape scene but you see no penetration and no private parts really.   All in all this is a really cool film I will admit there is one slightly upsetting scene but thats all. THIS IS A CLASSIC IN SHOCK CINEMA.Adams Rating - 9/10",negative
"Ichi the Killer is an intriguing story peppered with some of the most memorable characters since ""Sharkskin Man and Peach Hip Girl"" . Moreover, couple this with absolutely jaw dropping violent scenes, creative direction and you have a must see movie that delivers in every way. Trust me when I say, all other movies you will see after it will be undoubtedly measured against it.Director, Takeshi Miike's style can best be described as transgressive and overtly angular. Miike likes to scratch an itch till it bleeds and never pull the camera away. He is never one to shy away from delving deep into the seedier side of life(e.g. Hermaphrodites in Fudoh, Lactating ladies in Gozu, birthing of a fully grown man in IZO). Pushing buttons and grabbing your attention are all signature Miike. Nothing is ever off limits and nothing is ever what it seems in a Miike movie. This guy is a true original.As is the case with most of Miike's work , the violence quotient is amped to the ""enth"" degree. Nevertheless, with Ichi the Killer, expect nothing short of the aforementioned goodies rolled into a nice little package ready for your viewing pleasure.Ichi the Killer delivers in every way for one simple reason; from the beginning goo filled intro to the ultra-violent finale, you are simply glued to the screen thanks to excellent character development, twists and turns and awe inspiring violent visions of the yakuza underworld and those that inhabit it.I found myself staring so intently at times that my eyes were watering. At every turn there was something else so outlandish and out of the norm, at least from Western cinema standards, that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing. Even after all the movies I have seen this movie will forever be burned in my brain as one of the most original and beautifully violent movies I have ever seen.Watch this movie if you wish to experience a hyper-actively violent, transgressive romp through the yakuza underworld. At every turn you will come to appreciate some of the most outrageous and colorful cast of characters you will most likely ever see.10/10",positive
As your aware Takeshi Mike did light version of the manga since the manga itself is very dark too dark for people i think he did good job cutting stuff out from the mangasince got banned for good reason too,positive
"The first time I saw Ichi the Killer I thought of it as real, and therefore it was way too gross. I found some of the scenes hard to sit through. However the 2nd time I saw it, I watched it like a comic book, and I enjoyed it a lot more. Enough to buy the DVD. If you haven't seen it yet, beware that it contains some rather violent scenes, sometimes way over the top. There are also scenes of violence towards women that are rather distasteful, but try to remember that this is a movie adaption of a Japanese manga (comic book), which can be pretty raunchy. Remember: cartoon violence! It's kind of a crime movie with superheroes. VERY Japanese. If you didn't enjoy this movie because of the violence, try looking at the violence as cartoon violence, and it's actually a great flick. And Kakihara's clothes are just SO COOL! The film has a lot of atmosphere to it. I was also impressed to hear (in the DVD extras) that the director, Takashi Mike makes all of his films doing each scene in only 1 take.",positive
"This movie, like all of Miike's work, is extremely violent and yet intriguing.  Neil Gaiman once said that if a movie confuses you, you should see it again and see if there's anything there at all.  You might think that ""Ichii the Killer"" is just a senseless and sadistic action movie, but you'd only be half correct.  After all, Miike obviously enjoys making his audience's jaws drop.  Yet his films also deal with issues such as friendship, loyalty, insanity, and social dysfunction.  Much like David Lynch, he employs hyperbole to create a forum for discussion.  I can't say that I've exactly figured out what ""Ichii"" is trying to say, or whether or not it's trying to say anything specific at all, but I recommend it to those with strong stomachs.  I guarantee, like with all Miike's other movies, that you've seen nothing like it.",positive
"the opening scene has got to be the mostly unique movie going experience i have experienced. hope i don't offend anyone, but i think it is typically Japanese. where else in the world would anything come near this!! the film on the whole has a strange attraction to it that kept me watching it all the way through and in the end i sympathised with the 2 main characters Ichi and kakihara. it is pure sadistic but with elements of comedy which was perfectly balanced. please do watch this film and try watch it till the end, the performance of the actors are of a high quality, paulyn sun(karen) is an absolute babe, it is an experience you wont forget in a while.",positive
"Without a doubt one of the most outright shockingly violent films i have ever seen. Extreme cinema didn't know what hit it when this came out. Its very easy for directors trying to make violent films, for the violence to become gratuitous and pointless, but Miike maintains the relevance as he explores ideas of masochism and sadism. Combined with his own mind for creative shots, he turns a blood bath into a visually stunning epic of pain, discomfort, lost childhoods, cheats and lies. None of these things are what you would normally look for in a film, but somehow they hold together and you genuinely feel empathy with some of the characters.The violence is gruesome and gory and very realistic, not a film for anyone with a weak heart or even if you just ate, in fact its probably a good idea to keep a bucket nearby just in case - this is a film that will make or break its viewer.",positive
"What more can be said that hasn't already about this film? From insane director, Takashi Miike comes 'Ichi The Killer'. An uber-violent film based off of Hideo Yamamoto's equally gory Manga (Koroshiya 1). The story consists of a masochist named Kakihara (Played brilliantly by Tadanobu Asano) conducting a search for a missing Yakuza boss. His intense and violent methods of interrogation, start to bring fear to other members of the Yakuza gangs. All the while a disturbed man named, Ichi is going around slaughtering people in graphic ways left and right, Kakihara begins to admire him. Featuring such bloody highlights as a man getting sliced in half, from the head down to the groin, nipples cut off, and a painful torture sequence involving oil and pins. This movie is sure to please those looking for tons of carnage.",positive
"Heh. A brilliant film, the more you're interested in THINKING about cinema, the more this film will reward you. It is perverse, audacious, bizarre, and indeed quite... funny? Well, not exactly; I can see why other IMDBers have disagreed about whether it can be called a comedy or not -- there were many times when I laughed aloud when watching the film, but it was more in, uh, shock and awe than amusement (But that's the essence of humour, in a way, isn't it, to prod us in sensitive, taboo pink spots? If so, this IS a comedy -- but it's a cattle prod the director is using on us). I mean, I laughed uproariously when Kakihara grabbed his tongue by the piercing and cut the tip of it off, as a token of sincere apology to his yakuza bosses, who recoil, turn green, faint, etc... A minute later Kakihara has been to the hospital and is proudly displaying the stitches in it, which we get a gleeful little close-up of; it takes a certain TYPE of viewer to appreciate the humour in all this. (The tongue chunk, complete with piercing, is sent in a jar to an aggrieved mob boss -- Kakihara has been torturing him with hot oil while he hangs from hooks through his flesh -- but does nothing to appease the man, who seizes the tongue and crushes it, leaving us to wonder what it FEELS like to squeeze severed tongue... Or maybe that was just me). Miike is superb at foiling -- or, well, let's say subverting and re contextualizing -- audience expectations, torturing us with our own sadism, rewarding us for our masochism -- giving us exactly what we don't want when we don't want it, or better, giving us what we thought we did want, yet in such an excessive way as to cause the jaw to drop -- while being bold enough to slyly comment on the whole process throughout, to ionize it -- a smart ass through and through, at least during this film. I mean, it's hard to do the film justice on one viewing (and of the rated version, at that), but it's smart stuff, tho' indeed, quite twisted. Tsukamoto Shinya is pretty fun, too, in a role that could be a parody of his manipulating/evil characters in his own films (I'm thinking of TETSUO II and A SNAKE OF JUNE, in particular). Highly recommended. (Note: these comments were based on the 117 minute rental copy I located -- sounds like the 129 minute one is my next stop).",negative
"10 gold stars for Tadanobu Asano AKA Kakihara, this was an awesome example of yakuza genre films. Yes, yes, there's a lot of gore and psychosis, however, if you know this genre, could you expect anything else?The effects are great, the storyline (especially crossing from such a different culture) is comprehensive if you pay attention to little details and aren't put off by the madness of Kakihara and Ichi. Well, why stop there? The whole cast of characters are mad in some way, shape or form.**possible SPOILER**The mystery, enigma at the end is wonderful, nothing makes me smile like a film or book which leaves me scratching my head and gets the cogs spinning in my mind.Too many in the Western culture expect everything to be spelled out in the end, it's refreshing to have such a fun flick leave you to decide what it all meant when the credits roll.**End possible SPOILER**As a chick, I also have to say, Kakihara is darn sexy. Because of Koroshiya I, I went looking for other films which Tadanobu Asano has been in. My favorite so far, so bad it's delicious, is Sharkskin Man and Peachhip Girl. Though I must say that Koroshiya I far exceeds it.In the American film scene, I believe that this is somewhat comparable to Kill Bill Vol. I. At least in the genre portrayed, the music, the color and the beautiful mix of traditional yakuza with the new style of filming/directing.All in all, I can't wait to own Ichi the Killer so that I can watch it again and again.",positive
"This Movie is nothing like Miike's Audition for me one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen. Ichi the Killer might be different but it makes you arch to the point of almost vomit with the must disgusting trying to be extremely different scenes. Who want's to see a title of a movie coming out of a dripping puddle of semen. This movie is so sick that even if you don't see it and someone tries to explain it to you it will make you think twice if you want to even talk to that person again. So from the begging to the end the worst experience of my life. WHERE'S THE CUT THAT ICHI MADE ON KAKIHARA'S FOREHEAD WHEN HE LANDS ON THE FLOOR DEAD? If I had to recommend an excellent adaptation of a Manga or any comic book to the big screen go see Azumi, this a totally different kind of experience. With characters that looks like where drawn on the screen.",negative
"Allright, this was definitely not the worst film shown on the Stockholm Film Festival and as a film in it's department it gives what it promises: blood, more blood, some more blood, spectacular gore scenes and even more spectacular characters. However again, it seems as if the point of making film has turned from storytelling to an attempt to gross out the viewers. And when all the viewers are used to splatter and gore, it's difficult to make something so revolting so as to go beyond even their limits.The big difference between Ichi and a lot of other splatter movies (insert any Troma title or one of the classics like braindead here) is the extreme sadism it shows. Here the splatter is not focused on fights and accidents (as is more common) but mainly the main characters go around and dismember, chop up, mutilate and torture people in creative ways. Even this, I'm sure, most of the connoisseurs of such films are used to. The thing that I found disturbing was the scenes (sometimes felt to have been inserted quite pointlessly) when women get beaten and raped, in that order. Sure, Ichi doesn't try to fool people into thinking it's a pg-movie, but the explicit beating-rapes felt unnessesary.On the plus side, it was in a way nice to be surrounded by people who, for a change, laugh at the same scenes in a movie that I do, that rarely happens on any given show throughout the Hollywood film year. Also, there wes some interesting cameraworks and some nice effects. (Smoking a cigarette through your cheeks anyone?)On the whole, compared to the 10 other films I saw on the Stockholm Film Festival this was definitely not one of the worst. (Compared to for example Trouble Every Day, this is an Oscar nomination)...",negative
"I only watched half of Ichi the Killer. I feel like a terrible person for watching more than six seconds of it.Best as I can figure, Ichi the Killer is an excuse to showcase the rape, torture, mutilation and murder of young, lithe, objectified women while hiding behind the veil of extremity and cartoonishness. I can't see any merit to this film, whatever merit it may have held is destroyed by its misogyny. I also can't see why this movie is so vehemently defended by its fans. Either there is a general genre-based desire for graphic, chauvanistic brutality or we live in a world that is grossly desensitized to the concept of rape, because otherwise I can't fathom why a film like this would be made or enjoyed.",negative
"The themes of gratuitous gore and excessive and perverse sexual fantasy are realms I always felt better left to the animes. With live action there is a level of realism that no amount of camp can overcome. The end result comes across as overtly shocking and completely unnecessary. But I say this in the best sense of the word, because the reality is, I appreciate film makers such as this pushing the boundaries of film.Stylistically the film is quite breathtaking. The use of color and light and shadow is consistent throughout the film and they add to the fantastical nature of the events being played out. Comedy and the ridiculous nature of many of the scenes also add to their entertainment value - an appreciated side note that American films such as Hostel seem to continually fall short in.I have just finished watching it, and I am still trying to figure out how I feel about the film in general (as well as the nausea to go away) so it is quite hard to offer a good commentary on the film itself. I highly recommend you watch it if you feel your stomach can handle it (really, I mean this). If you are a fan of anime or semi-experimental film-making then this is really a must-see film.",positive
"Ichi the killer is one of the sickest and most disgusting movies I ever saw.Loaded with great visual and special effects for its time ,the movie is an action packed Japanese gangster movie that keeps your wanting more.My friends were talking about this movie back in the day ,I didn't get to watch it u til recently and I'm glad I didn't see it till now because it's a sick and perverted movie lol",positive
"when I saw this movie for the first time... I tell myself: ""This is the coolest yakuza-things-I've-never-seen politics""... With so much twisted plot and humors... And the tension is build up pretty nice...And then I read the comic... And I tell my self: ""Whoa!!! Cool!!! Awesome!!! Ouch!!!""... The comic version of Koroshiya-1 is much way way way better than the movie... It's not that the movie is bad or else... Takashi Miike just make some non-sense story to short the entire story based on the comic...so... What's the differences? Some of them are... - On the comic, Jijii is not an old man who can brainwash other people, he's just a smart old man who's 'playing' with the mafia business that make the condominium where kakihara is living will be cleaned from yakuza... And... The body he's having come from hormones he shot to his butt... And one more thing... He didn't take off his cloth to show how macho he is when he wanted to fight... It doesn't make sense... - About the ending... Kakihara's death... On the comic, Kakihara died because he can't endure his SM desire that turn backfired to himself as fear... So the crazy Ichi is chasing him easily to death... On the movie, Kakihara died because of he was hallucinating (?) that he's still having fight with Ichi and fall off when he's trying to avoid Ichi's kick... Again... It doesn't make sense...But... There's some unique things from the movie... Like Tadanobu Asano who's playing Kakihara's role that act like a weird-thin-funky yakuza... Not like the comic, an elegant-fatty-SM-mania who like to stab everywhere... etc.My conclusion is... When you want a yakuza movie with gore and black humor... Than you come with right decision... But... When you want to watch this movie because of the comic... Um... I think you will regret it... Trust me...I hope my comment will be useful... And sorry for my bad English...",negative
"--The opening is awesomely done and is a good sample of some cool directing moments that happen throughout the movie. You can expect good editing and exciting camera angles during action scenes. Kakihara's character is very well designed, with the scars, piercings and choice of flashy clothing. It is visually a pretty well made movie.--That said, the plot is kinda all over the place. The main characters, Ichi and Kakihara are superficially interesting, but the movie doesn't ever really dig in to them or make them anything more than cool-looking cardboard cutouts.--Overall, watching this movie was a peculiar experience. But I wouldn't do it again, the plot just doesn't hold my interest. Keep in mind that there's literally blood and guts flying around in a few scenes, and the movie gets very perverse here and there. If you're squeamish, I don't recommend watching this movie.",negative
"Most people that watch this will group it among other two-bit slasher and shock films, which is a tragedy. Beyond the gratuitous violence (which is more cartoony than horrific) is an examination of the human condition, or more specifically, the extreme hedonist condition. That much is obvious, but the interest lies in the contrast of Ichi and Kakihara not with each other but with Jijii. His motive in all of this, in manipulating Ichi and obsessing with Kakihara, is revealed during the climax: upon finding Kakihara's body his face twists into a sort of butchery of sadness and happiness. It took me years to realize that in truth he does not feel both but neither; he is nothing, and his obsession with the two men that go to such extremes to feel alive results of his own desperate attempts to be; to learn to be. With both men gone he is left without an escape from his suffocating nothingness and hangs himself. In sum we are given a triad: the sadist, the masochist, and the nihilist. Ichi and Kakihara's existences may have seemed hellish and undesirable, the movie proposes, but Jijii's is far worse.",positive
"Miike (pronounced Mickey) Takashi is something special. I think you need to see quite a few of his movies to get an idea of what he's about. If you just see Fudoh and this film, you think he's a splatter-crazed manga freak. If you just see Audition, you think he's from another planet. But his movies as a whole are like some kind of overblown fantasy about Japanese society, families who can't communicate, sexuality gone into overdrive, violence behind every facade. Ichi is truly the most over-the-top movie I have ever seen. It reminds me a bit of first discovering John Woo. Except that while Woo was inspired by Peckinpah and Jean-Pierre Melville, this guy's influences seem to be gore comics, metal videos and his own unflinching take on modern life. Specifically, we're talking about EXTREME s&m, rooms full of entrails, sadist twin cops wearing haute couture, an insane Yakuza with slits in his face, a man stuffed into a TV set and executed with skewers, a hero who is probably mentally ill and cries all the time, a man sliced in half, and a LOT of very disturbing rape fixations. That's only the stuff that jumps to mind immediately. Pretty much every scene will surprise, shock, disturb or (depending on how hardened you are) amuse you. I left this film wondering who the intended audience could be. Japanese people, certainly. Committed seekers-out of the bizarre like myself, yes. But even the film festival audience I was with reeled out, punchdrunk and silent. It's kind of like industrial music, it makes sense while you're experiencing it, afterwards it's all just a ringing in your ears and a disoriented worldview.",negative
"It is interesting that most reviews of ""Ichi"" dwell so heavily upon the violence depicted in the film. To me this is reminiscent of Tarrantino's work (particularly ""Pulp Fiction""). Much of the violence depicted within Miike's ""Ichi"" is actually implied, meaning that as a director, he will set the scene up and proceed to show you something, only to cleverly cut away, leaving your mind to fill in the details. I had read many reviews before viewing ""Ichi the Killer"" which proclaimed this film to be exceedingly gory and unnecessarily violent. After viewing the film, I found both positions to be false. The gore is no more than many mainstream American releases, and the violence, although unsettling at some points was on par with what you may expect from the average Kung-Fu movie. If anything, I was surprised by the absurdly comic value of some scenes within the film. Make no mistake, this is a movie made for adults (in the United States that explicitly entails an audience of at least 18 years of age) but I found nothing in this film which would necessitate any further caveat.Technically I would rate this as a beautiful film, with points going for both style and substance. The soundtrack for the film was very good, as was the depiction of the locales. The world depicted in the film consisted of a strange dichotomy of fluorescent lighting contrasted with rich shadows. As far as editing is concerned, the film moved at a pace which is reflected in the frantic nature of the storyline. The plot, a morality play about the use of evil to fight evil, is a bit obtuse for the average American movie goer, but as it has been stated before, if you posses any depth in regards to philosophy you should find this an provocative film.Overall, ""Ichi the Killer"" is a very good film. It is unfortunate that many cannot see through the violence and enjoy the film on the level that the director intended.",positive

"This film is definitely oe of the most disturbing films I have ever seen next to Baise Moi. It is so violent that the only reaction you can have is to laugh at the horrific deaths and disturbing torture scenes.  I need to say that athough the content is not my favorite the cinematography, digital effects and character development is great.  A must see for writers of the abnorm.  One last thing, if you think DEAD ALIVE is funny you will laugh yourself in half at this one.",positive
"Ichi the Killer is not for the faint at heart. Grotesque images and taboo themes continuously flood the screen. Miike wants to make the audience feel uncomfortable and he is successful at doing so. Through a very stylized film and the addition of comic elements, the feeling of uncomfortableness is part of the experience.In some way, Miike presents a real-life superhero/anime movie. Certain aspects are exaggerated (such as the art direction) creating a step away from realism, but it is the characters that bring it back into reality. The acting is excellent. Ichi and Kakihara are psychologically interesting characters and steal every scene they are in.Watch it. The movie is 2 hours of engrossment and will definitely cause a reaction.",negative
"I don't really know what to say about this one. A hysterical killing machine Ichi with never ending sexual erection and a Jakuza gang and psychotic leader of the gang with sadistic masochist tendencies were enemies throughout the movie. It was a long time ago since I watched this movie for the last time so I don't totally remember the plot. But Ichi character was kind of funny. Him being innocent and brutal at the same time was interesting (was it really? i have to think it again). Blood bath scenes were the only visual motivation for me to watch this movie. Otherwise why would anybody watch this movie? By the way, Ichi is disturbing. I hated this Ichi more than I hated this Jakuza leader. total destruction!",negative
"I loved miike´s recent outbursts like AUDITION, DEAD OR ALIVE, or VISITOR Q, but this one really takes the cake. it´s a mindless romp that only affects your stomach, which is sad for it could have been a real gut-wrenching chiller. the gore-hounds will love it but they are easily satisfied anyway. a film for nerds or for those who want to become one.",negative
"who remembers Bad Taste or Braindead by Peter Jackson?People will keep producing crap for the sake of crap! And its good! You don't know what's sweet if you don't know what sour is (that is when you still have your tongue).
Movies like Ichi are to be watched with an overview, like as you do with a documentary, i think that's the purpose.I can't rate this movie and it shouldn't be rated, a little bit like abstract art that makes no sense, you want to see the painting but you'll never buy it!",negative
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! And that's an achievement because I have ridiculously low standards when it comes to movies. For example I'm in love with Epic movie. But this movie has no good qualities whatsoever! The dialog is bland, the violence is disappointing (that's not violence, that's a kid's show), the plot is pointless and plain crap! But the worst part is the acting. Or I don't know if you can really call that acting....it was more like a couple of Asian people screaming and being annoying. Nothing about this movie is good. It's an absolutely worthless piece of crap movie that should be erased from the very existence. I actually intended to give it 0/10 but IMDb wouldn't let me.",negative
"I have a soft spot for this movie, I must admit.
It's sheer offhanded dealing with horrific gore and violence intrigues me.
But the thing I love best is it's stylistic nature. These characters need not be deep. need not act extremely well. need not develop as a character.... they just are.. but no one cares. the camera work is OK at best. very simplistic and non-frills for a studio movie...but that does not matter. The plot is simplistic and unimportant, as if you are just waiting for the two leads to meet up and get to the fighting... but everyone gleefully watches all the extras get mowed down gruesomely in the meantime...because what is center-stage is the violence and gore. This is what it is about and what people come to see.It takes 1 core concept and runs with it without flinching or holding back.
I respect that.If you want a GREAT splatter flick this is for you. I love it.",positive
"Apart from the disgusting ear-scene in Reservoir Dogs I've never seen something as violent as Ichi the Killer before. I am not at all into splatter movies like Braindead but Ichi the Killer's stylish violence inflicted a strange fascination on me.Maybe you can say that Miike intends to reveal a 'dark side' of man, maybe he succeeds in doing this. However, this has already been done countless times (e.g. A Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide). What makes Ichi the Killer worth seeing is it's style.",positive
"Me and some friends rented this movie expecting to see graphic scenes of gore and a very viable plot. 2 hours later, we were sorely disappointed at its lack of showing any graphic violence, and the disappointing plot. There was suggestive gore, but it cuts away way too soon. I liked the style and fast cuts, but the graphics weren't impressive. This works more as a dark comedy than an action thriller. The movies title is far too misleading. Be careful if you rent this. Its not what it seems. Also, Ichi is a pathetic killer. If I had known I was going to see a crying pussy murder people I wouldn't have watched this. (1/5)",negative
"this is good movie man... i have never expected i would watch such a movie in my whole life... crazy film... i love these kinda movies and i really think it is one of the best Japanese psycho thriller movies... awesome flick... i loved the guy with his mouth cut open,his character was cold and fearless... and of course brutal... cool guy...i kinda found this killer kinda scary and weird... i wouldn't try to mess around with a guy like him...and of course the director not to forget he is a really awesome director too man... two thumbs up for this mega hit movie... i really enjoyed it and i kinda nearly vomited throughout the movie ha ha so i think this is enough a explanation",positive
"kakihara and ichi is two of the most brutal sadistic pervert character i have seen in my entire life. Not to forget Mortimer from Beyond th Limit ( check this out if you love splatter movies!!) as for the movie, it is so disturbing and confusing at times. it makes me wonder whether every single weird scene have any meaning at all. the sperm, the flashback, the torn apart mouth. is it supposed to be a metaphor or what? is the whole movie is only a hallucination created by the hypnotics man with the ""o my gawd"" :0 muscle? confusing or not , it still kick me straight in the a**!! miike ! give me some of your acid man!!!",positive
"It doesn´t have all interesting concept from the manga.The twin brothers aren´t muscular guys of 6.5 ft, they aren´t competitive, but the actor makes them disturbing
they have a third brother, in the manga both kill their brother, in the movie they just mention him, but you don´t get if is just a friend or a oath brother (but is a real brother)they aren´t very nice with the other, in the manga they are good brothers and spend time togetherIchi have a more disturbing life in the manga, we can see is full body as a muscular guy who trains all daykakihara is more violent in the manga, killing people and hitting guys with no remorsea few parts from the manga are skipped, so the 100% of the context and story...you may dont see 30% so is a little bit difficult to get everythingbut the personality, attitude and style of kakihara in the movie is way better, he is enjoying his lifestyle
the tortures are good
the performance and long scenes add a lot
they really have contact with the actors when they hit themand the ending is different but is same as good as the manga one, more confusing, but goodgreat movie and great manga.",positive
"...This film is about violence. About giving and receiving pain. I do really think this film HAS something to say about violence and thus is not pointless. What make people react badly to it is that the movie itself does not seem to condamn violence. But it is so gruesome that I don't think it sees violence as a good thing either. And yes this film is funny too. It is definitely for extreme viewers, but not that much. I've friends who've been disappointed, for they've been too much warned, so...And about women... well I think the movie tells something good about them: even the most violent girl of the film can't be as deeply violent as the men. She plays violent, but in the end she's not: neither that sadistic (she can't satisfy her lover), neither that masochist (she does not really want Ichi to be brutal with her). So real deep violence is a man thing. And let's not be proud of that.",negative
"You've probably heard about the violence or how the movie is ""totally ____ed up"" or some such thing. If you can turn your moral sense off and remember it's only a movie, you'll find the violence either really beautiful or really funny. Regardless, you have to give credit to this film as a visual masterpiece.However, the ""deep psychological"" concepts in this film aren't particularly deep. They're laid out right in front of you. A masochistic hero chases down a sadistic villain. Guess what happens -- exactly what you'd expect, with nothing special. Oooh, he's been hypnotized. Way too heavy-handed for my tastes -- nothing smart or clever about it. Only interesting observation is the comparisons between Ichi and Batman. Batman has a mentor who helps him through his childhood trauma to fight crime. Ichi is the same, plus the hypnotism angle -- he's Batman gone bad. A neat little genre meditation.The fact that the characters are all generally twisted might create the illusion of depth... but really, it's just pushing standard yakuza stuff to the extreme. The push is horizontal towards shock value, and not vertical towards depth of meaning or plot complexity -- if you catch what I'm trying to say.",positive
"I know some feel that the splatter content of Ichi might be secondary to the story, but come on! I saw it just because of the content I'd heard about, not the character development. I saw it for the same reasons I watched Day of the Dead - and it had nothing to do with acting or story. Maybe I'm desensitized, my gut made of steel, but I thought there could have been more blood and guts. Because that's all it was, mind you, the story shows our hero as a head case - obviously flawed, and the antagonist as really sadistic and masochistic, and a f****d up face - they both had back stories of sorts. But, it wasn't really that intense, except for the girls being beaten, etc, I didn't care for that (those were the gross parts). It wasn't as effective as Audition (only for the gore content, Audition was kinda slow and obviously a different kind of film). I liked the intensity of TCM 2003, and the acting happened to be pretty good. I liked to bloodbath in Scarface, and it just happened to be intense and had good acting. Ichi the Killer (or 'Koroshiya'), was very good but I wouldn't get all up in arms about how violent it was. they just happened to have designed some good guts and sliced off faces - it's the stuff heard in the background of films which scares me more, because I don't know what it is. Brains on floors and faces sliding down walls, I know what it looks like on film and I know how they probably made it, and if it's on screen for too long, it gets less intense. I give it 4 out of 5 (****)",negative
"I was first exposed to this film about a year ago when I first moved into the dorms (go figure) and was so perplexed by it that I had to watch it several more times. And even now, afte watching it several times, I don't know if I can quite put what I feel about it into words. I liken watching this movie to looking at a horrible car accident. You see a couple of really smashed up cars, some blood, etc. It's a horrible, disgusting scene that you shouldn't want to look at. However, you become transfixed by the enormity of what you're looking at and cannot look away. To say that this film is violent is a huge understatement. It makes Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs or A Clockwork Orange look like Barney. However, like in Kill Bill, the violence is supposed to be over the top and somewhat not believable. I think that it's more supposed to be about the messages that the director is attempting to convey. Another film that I liken this movie to is Bum Fights (I know this is weird, but bear with me...lol). Bum Fights is gross, disgusting, disturbing, and all around gut-wrenching, but I believe that it brings to lights an aspect of human life that most people choose to ignore and pretend that it does not exist. I am not agreeing with any of the horrible acts that happen in Bum Fights (or Bum Fights 2), just saying that it is something that everybody should see to open their eyes. So, to wrap this all up into a neat little package... If you're fairly desensitized to violence, watch this movie, and be sure to get the full, uncut version. The cut version takes out some scenes which are fairly critical to the plot if you ask me. While the plot if fairly odd and hard to follow (I'm sure that a lot is lost in the translation), it's enough to keep you glued to your TV set. I rank this movie a 10/10 because it still turns my stomach every time that I see it.",negative
"I just wanted to take the time to explain to some of the viewers of this movie what the ending was all about. During the rooftop scene at the end, after Ichi killed the former cop, the cop's son came out and attacked him while he was wounded. Ichi couldn't defend himself because he is a gentle person to those that are not ""bullies"" and would not hurt the child. As Kakihara is watching this, he is again led to disappointment by not having the masochistic pleasure of fighting Ichi. Since there is no one left to try and kill Kakihara, he decides to hurt himself by inserting the small spears into his ears. In doing so, he damages his brain but does not die. This is where it gets confusing. When Kakihara looks up, he sees Ichi standing there, ready to fight, and the boy's dead body behind him. This is all a hallucination caused by the brain damage Kakihara just inflicted on himself. Ichi had actually died. Therefore, when they fight, and Kakihara has his forehead cut, it never actually happened. Kakihara went crazy and threw himself off the balcony. That is why there is no scar on the forehead when Jijii looks at him. Afterward, I am not sure if Kakihara actually dies or if he is just brain dead. In the final scene where Ichi is walking around with the children, he's not there physically, but spiritually (hence the symbolism of the crow flying). He is protecting the children.",negative
"If you like extremely offbeat movies, you should check this out. They come along with a lot of violence, though, which isn't the reason I like Miike's movies; I don't like violence per se. The main reason I like his films is because he depicts his characters and the situations that they are in so well. All of his movies are very unique from one another. Sometimes the violence will be so extreme and stylized that it's to the point of being humorous (Ichi the Killer), but not as much as Kill Bill. And other times he will make you feel like what's on your screen is happening for real. A lot of people compare him to David Lynch (Gozu is a good example), but you shouldn't think of him that way. They are two completely different animals: Miike is a leopard(very smart, yet still capable of ripping your heart out) and Lynch is a regular, trained house cat (he can only scratch at you, and, while he does have a brain, all he's interested in is confusing you for no good reason other than to get fed). Miike is far superior. I have noticed something about Asian cinema, and I think Ichi the Killer is a good example: They tend to not follow the same kind of pattern throughout that American movies do. American movies will usually keep to the point that they're trying to make, and that's it; they're much more refined formulaically, but not necessarily better because of it. I see Fight Club as being very Asian in its style. There is so much happening throughout it (flashbacks,footnotes,random visuals). I can watch these movies over and over because there is always something that I've either forgotten about or didn't even notice in the first place. For its type of movie, I give Ichi a 9/10",positive
"I had always wanted to check out a Takeshi Miike film and this brutally violent thriller was my first.Miike is a genius with a camera, his also poetic with his visuals, he displays gore in such a gorgeous manner that its a spectacle to watch.Pure eye candy for a fan of violent cinema, Ichi the killer follows an emotional man raised as a murderer dressed as a super hero. The film features eccentric characters and some wacky moments. It also follows a sadistic Yakuza gangster, who displays the most blood letting set pieces.A grand masterpiece of thrills and kills, this flick truly excels in the department of insane imagination and offers the audience a surreal opening (The title is carved into semen).The barbaric murders will haunt you for ages, a brilliantly made film!",positive
"I wanted to destroy Ichi the Killer, because I was tortured by the gallons of blood and the tons of bowels purred inside my TV. But the filming (absolute style), the main villain (the blond one, that even scare me when I first saw the DVD box in a video store) and the way I was shocked, against common sense and sanity, made my conclude that I was a another victim of this film.Ichi the Killer is a definitive Knock-Out. Is not the kind of Bergman, Almodovar or Truffant movie that your artsy or intellectual teachers would celebrate, neither is the Friday 13th kind of trash that one of those pseudo-sadistic, nutty friends of our high school could enjoy in an indolent summer night.Is a movie made to disturb all kind of mentalities. Is a deep travel into psychosis, sadomasochism and all kinds of anti-social behaviors. Those who appreciate great films will be terrified by the angular shots, the completely disconcerting rhythm compulsive is an underestimation, the characters (there's not an accurate adjective to describe them: creepy, schizophrenic, sadistic, psychopathic I could go on for pages).And those who think they're though because they have watched hundreds of cheap horror movies would find themselves begging for the end of some sequences.I will give this five stars, you give'em the rest. Is not that I think this a mediocre film. By no meaning! Is just that this movie crushes every theory and is beyond ovation or condemnation. Finally, please take this advice: don't watch Ichi the Killer alone. Is not a horror movie,is brutal absurdity, depicted without mercy and with the great style,proper of a great director. Why watch with company? Because, in case you lose your sanity while watching Ichi the Killer, someone will take you to a sanitarium quickly.",negative
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**I bought this movie on a recommendation of a friend. And after ready some of the reviews here and else where i got pretty excited to see it. But it turned out i expected to much from this movie. Maybe i just have a sick mind or something but this movie did not shock me in any way. The first torture scene starts promising with a guy hanging from a sealing all hooked up and getting some sadistic torture with needles. But after that it starts to get less brutal. The scenes where no violence is going on in this movie are a bit boring. the story isn't that good. And the ending is just lame, ichi really started to annoy my with all his crying.I heard a lot of people say this movie was really shocking and brutal but i think this movie is far to cartoon like to be shocking. For example Take ichi and his nice shoes, he only has a little blade of an inch sticking out of the back of his shoe but he can cut somebody in half with it. And when somebody gets his throat sliced in this movie the blood seems to be coming out of a fire hose.All in all i thought the movie was a bit disappointed, it starts promising but gets a bit boring and just has a lame ending if you ask me, but still if you enjoy horror violence and gore i think you will have a nice time watching it once..i give this movie 5.7 out of 10.0",negative
"Ichi the Killer is a very good entertainment with a very simple story: The gang members are looking for the killer of their leader, during this time the killer continues to make trouble. The film contains a lot of thing rarely seen all combined together: gore, gangster, humor, weirdness, torture, porn and rape. Not easy to make a good movie with all these aspects combined together but Miike is doing it handily!Humor level, many are at the dialogues. The scene of the tongue I had a good laugh. Despite his 12xmin, the film is not really suffering longer except I think by the time the movie turns in round and gone nowhere except violence",positive
"Rarely am I so conflicted on a film I dislike like ""Ichi the Killer"", but I guess that's appropriate for a movie that tries so much. I appreciate its attempt at marrying sadomasochism and abuse with tropes of yakuza films, slasher flicks, exploitation revenge fantasies, and superhero stories. There's some creative kills, trippy editing, and the theme of pain cycling between danger and pleasure is present. But how it's reflected in the story comes off as convoluted, overindulgent, and inconsistent in tone. The portrayal of sexual violence flip flops between cartoonish and disturbing, robbing it of impact despite it's notorious reputation. Ichi and Kakihara overshadow pretty much any character in terms of relevance (even Ichi's handler), yet only one of them has a fully-fleshed out arc. And while the plot points all tie together, it's done in a way that kills any momentum it built during its stretched-out runtime to where the climax is just one pathetic joke. Some of my complaints could be excused with ""it's a black comedy"", but in execution I found I was laughing at the movie rather than with it.",negative
"I will keep this short an sweet. brilliant film , legendary and daring Japanese film director ( i think). The film explores violence and numbs the viewer with excessive over the top gore which is bound to put a lot of casual film viewers off. However if you can get past the bloodshed, you will be able to enjoy a visually startling yet brilliant peace of film making with new ideas. I saw the cut version and wasn't quite as bad as i thought it would be, gore terms. but the uncut version is probably a lot worse. Brilliant ending to the film too. requires many viewings. Gd job done and a brave piece of filming.Ben ( 16)",positive
"It's great if you love gory movies which I happen to enjoy. Even when I thought it was over it wasn't even half way threw! The thing I think the thing that movies are trending to is not introducing characters slowly. They dont say a name & expect you to know who ""hunter"" is which was the case for this movie. When did they mention ""suziki""? Besides that the plot was very strange with little to no explanation & minor weirdness if you like gore this movie wii do you good",negative
"Ichi the killer is great. It's one of Miike's best films, incorporating the unrelentless pace of 'city of lost souls' with the black humour of 'visitor q'. The action is insane, Miike manages to come up with tons of inventive ways for ichi to dispatch his foes, all of them suitably gratuitous, it's probably not the best film for those with weak stomachs. The film does have scenes of masochism which are a bit off-putting, but mostly it's harmless over the top violence played for laughs rather than shocks. Ichi is a likable protagonist, in a 'so crazy he's funny' way and the film has heaps of quotable moments. Definitely a must-see for Miike fans as well as action fans in general.",positive
"I loved Audition by Miike and so when I heard of this title I ran home with a rental from the local video store with excitement.  While the style is definitely Miike's, I found that I didn't like it quite as much as Audition. It is hard to care much about many of the people being tortured because there is no character development in most of them with the exception of Ichi and Kakihara.  Kakihara likes to be tortured, but only by those who are the best at inflicting pain.  Therefore he is very studied in the art of giving pain and practices this with relish.  There is a poor slob in the movie who is tied to a chair and has grossly enlared needles thrown at his exposed face and who knows what else is done to him before they get the idea to cut his unmentionalbles into several ribbons with a pair of scissors.  While there was little to no character development with this man it is hard not to be sympathetic to his plight. I felt a large rush of horror even though I am a female.  Ichi is interesting and has a strangely boyish face for one who is so unbalanced and capable of massive human destruction. It is hard not to feel sympathy for him as well because he is manipulated and used by someone who engages in mentally torturing him to achieve his ends.  At the end of the film we get some mixed up mental messages and  have to decide what to do with this information-Miike's trademark as far as I can tell.  If you can stand ultraviolence  and are as curious as I was-check this title out.",negative
"I am from a special group, which look for this kind of movies. The first time I'd watched it I was just sure there was a lot of inspiration hidden somewhere in movie space. I mean all the plot was incredibly done, with all the insane Ichi's mind (together to Miike's).All the killing and the confront at the end show how amazing is a serial killer movie. For sure it's so common to find free violence in other (forbidden and interesting) films, but into this one, nothing modern else I could find with all real and original expressions. It also shows up a strange nowadays culture around society and all stuff included inside ""anormal"" desires or non-realistic ideas (Kakihara and Ichi's story). Some scenes are much violent (more than in AUDITION), and free killing (like Kano inside the TV box; or the drug woman's broken fingers). ALthough bizarre, the movie was well produced, mainly about the deaths and the torture sessions (you gotta see Suzuki with the boiling oil... reeeeeeeaaaallllllly painful).To conclude, that's a movie which violence and insane minds are quite at all mixed to an underworld. Watch and love the bloodshed.",positive
"Ichi the Killer :You can say that this is one of the rubbish movies.Ichi the killer is one movie that you have two parameters to see it.First:Do not eat when you see this movie otherwise you will have to clean carpets :p Second :See it with some friends.If you see it alone you will probably turn it off or kill yourself but with friends you will laugh a lot.)I think this movie is a precious diamond for some people and a crap for other.If you like movies with blood that is your movie ,if you like horror movies with plot you better stay away.This movie is a must for anyone who loves Japanese movies.Spent money on this movie.*******/**********",positive
"A fellow film-freak had told me about Ichi the Killer in great detail and I was nothing less than blown away even before seeing the film itself. When I actually sat down to watch it, I found myself deeply disturbed by the imagery; beyond the point of comfortability. I got through 20% of the film before I unfortunately had to turn it off. It was not because I wanted to, but had to. I am a realist when watching films; I remain as objective as possible. Yet even with such a mindset, I was forced into a space of uncomfortable surrealism. The disturbing imagery was overwhelmingly honest, and intimate. If I had thought the film was ""over the top ridiculously violent"", I would have had no problem with continuing with the rest of the film (by looking at it as objectively as I do). Yet it was a different kind of over the top, it was captivating while at the same time overly disturbing. I couldn't look away; I became far too involved with the characters and their situations.Miike is a genius; anyone who makes a film I am unable to get through because of my own emotions has a way with visual manipulation. Right when I thought i've seen all the violence and gore possible, he throws me this piece of work.Thank you Miike, for doing what no one else had the cojones to do.",positive
"The violence is comic book, a lot like ""Story of Ricky"". Unlike Ricky, a solid 5.0 movie, there isn't much slapstick or humor in the violence; however, it's not really disturbing either.There isn't much of a plot. Some of the reviewers here think there is some sort of hidden meaning to the film (no doubt, these are some of the ones who gave the movie a perfect 10); the story has an elliptical quality that invites interpretation (for example, when considering the character of Ichi against the relationship of the viewer to the film); but there is no depth to any of it. It's sort of a Brillo Box in the form of a crappy grind-house Japanese horror film. One may as well interpret the Kabbalah - you'll get whatever you want out of it. It's art, it just isn't very good.One positive: it does a decent job of setting a mood, but nowhere near as well as, for example, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's ""The Cure"", which didn't rely on gore at all.Back in reality, the primary function of this movie is film-as-spectacle. The king of spectacle is of course PT Barnum and his sideshow of freaks. Barnum never said ""there is a sucker born every minute"", but that's how I feel after hearing from friends how great this movie is.5.5 out of 10",negative
Beautiful movie. Very intense scenes. Good actors and good script. Hard to keep up with tough.. this is a movie you should see twice to get the final pieces to fall on place. Its worth it!,positive
"Great, gory ... Japanese..[small Spoilers ahead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]I saw this movie a dozen times and i must say its a alltime favorite (of me). Lots of people i know couldn't watch the full movie due to its sadistic ""flavour"". And many other people dislike this movie just because they didn't understood the plot (Watch it a few times!!!!) A fellow ducthman said that this movie wasn't that disturbing (???) and irreversible was much more gruesome (Man.. irreversible has only 1 schocking scene) and i totally disagree with this person.. OK irreversible has a more gruesome rape scene but that's all..There are a lot of stomach turning scenes (e.g the razor vs nipple scene) and there are lots of sadistic scenes (e.g. the Pin vs Chin scene). The scenes with Kakihara are as realistic as possible and the scenes with Ichi are ""comicbook manga come to live""..Miike takes you on a dark, screwed up and blood red journey, over-dosing the senses with the most outrageously gory and sordid sequences. just provin' to you that he still is the best director in the east..Anyway.. this is one good ""manga"" horror movie but if you are a mainstream horror movie viewer you probably don't understand or appreciate this movie..",negative
"The interesting thing about this film is the amorality of it. The two characters who battle are both psychopaths of different stripes, and although we feel some kind of sympathy for Ichii, he's hard to respect because he's such a coward.His power is strange and unexplained, like in the Tetsuo series.Does anyone know where in Japan this 'anger leads to metal spikes coming out of my body' thing comes from?Is it just these two films, or is there some earlier series or Myth that they reference?I consider Ichi the killer essential viewing.",positive
"Don't get me wrong, I love violence and gore in movies, but this must've been one of the lamest excuses for a movie I have seen. I had to pause it at one point just so I could take a break and have a nap. I like violent cult movies, which is the reason I bothered to check this out in the first place, because I heard people talk about it. If they would have bothered to mention the stupid slow dialogue about how rape is cool, the close up on a puddle of semen, and the goofy kid who fights gangsters and then runs home crying, I would have had second thoughts about seeing it. There are better violent movies than this. Versus is pretty slow and has quite some bad dialogue, but it is far superior to this movie!",negative
"I don't know if I am just completely desensitised but despite this film's misplaced infamy there was very little of what I would call shocking violence/gore (with the sole exception of the rape scenes because they were OTT and nasty)due to the ridiculously impossible feats such as slicing a man in half length ways with a blade that would have been too short to slice a potato and the frankly p*** poor blood spatter effects which look more like someone left the lid off a blender full of strawberry compote than bodily fluid making every ""graphic"" scene pathetically and unintentionally hilarious! Other problems with this film include the awful, awful and again I say AWFUL acting! half the cast lumbered around the set with expressions akin to that of a constipated person attempting to expel the poo equivalent of breeze blocks while the other half simply looked bored brainless. The script was limited and clichéd while the screenplay leaped and bobbed from one scene to the next with convoluted traffic sounds and blurred neon lights streaking across the lens until I wasn't sure if I was watching a film or someone just had slipped LSD into my drink! The story itself was a problem in as much as it evokes a ""what was the point of this?"" sentiment because as far as characterisation is concerned there are no sympathetic or really likable characters as any plights and/or sufferings they endured to get them where they are in life was completely overshadowed by the insufferable script, horrific acting and general pointlessness of it all. Over all I have given it one out of ten, primarily because the voting system doesn't work in minus numbers, and secondarily there is no worthwhile story to any of it, just that everybody is getting revenge on someone else for something or other and/or avoiding being killed in retribution for..I don't't know! lets just say running over the neighbour's gerbil! basically a dire waste of time for anyone who thinks films should contain a bit more than just gallons of strawberry compote...er I mean ""blood"" flying around in all directions for no reason apparent to the logical human mind....",negative
"Let's get the obvious out of the way; Ichi is filled with violence, rape, sadism, torture, etc. etc. And it's great. NOTHING, not even the rapes, are in the least bit realistic. I will admit I had some qualms about the rapes beforehand, but after actually watching them, they weren't as bad as everyone says they were. Any realism they had going for them are thrown out the window with the outlandish comic book like sound effects. That said, the violence and gore etc. does hold up rather well (all except the horrendous CGI) and anyone who is a fan of gore flicks will like it.Now for the critique; my biggest problem with Ichi was that it fully convinced itself that it had a solid story to build a character on when it doesn't. The first act fires on all cylinders, what you would expect from a film like this, but when the second act rolls along I was bored out of my mind. Ichi is a one dimensional character who is parading around like he is a three dimensional character. Granted, Nao Omori does a fine job portraying him, but his character is so poorly written it's painful to watch. Ichi cries....cries.....cries....and spouts on nonsensical dialogue all throughout the film.Kakihara on the other hand is an awesome character. Miike never tries to add unnecessary depth like he does with Ichi yet Kakihara comes off fully realized. This is mostly because of the great acting of Tadanobu Asano. Asano was born to play Kakihara and he shows it throughout the film. The other characters are just along for the ride. Even Jiji comes across as just another character in the film's wide array.The story, while fine, is too convoluted for its own good. What Ichi has is a simple by the books story of a kidnapped mob boss and the gangster who goes after him. Fine. Leave it at that. But Miike and company force too many things into the film; Ichi's back story, Jiji's passion, a bullied kid and his problems, the bullied kid's dad and his problems...the story gets way too convoluted and deep into the second act, Miike begins to rely on randomized images and cut to's that take you out of the scene and say WTF was that?The ending is not quite as ambiguous as Kurosawa's ""Cure"", but it leaves quite a bit of interpretation to the viewer. And while I would have preferred a balls out fight on the rooftop, the ending did grab me and make me think about what just happened; I like movies that make me think. And yes, Ichi is a tad deeper than I am leading you to believe (many of the themes this film portrays are sadism, masochism, misogyny, etc. etc.) but even those can't save the convoluted plotline.Overall, a film that tries too hard to have a story, has a deeply flawed ""good guy"" in Ichi, and an awful second act, Ichi only rates as a 6/10. But still, it is recommended if you have the stomach for it.",negative
"To put it simply, if you don't like a tiny bit of gore, then maybe you shouldn't watch this movie. However, if you can put up with a little bit (minor misjudgement) of blood on the screen, then this film is definitely under the bracket of masterpiece. The story, while at first hard to follow, is pure genius, complex enough to create interesting enigma's, but not so complex you lose track of where the film is going, and therefore interest. The other point to make is the use of the violence. Whilst the redness of the blood could be compared to Argento or either of the Kill Bill's, Miike's excessive use is genuinely jaw-dropping. The people I viewed the film with found many of the images disturbing, but when analysed, they add a deeper layer to the film than what first appears on the screen. All except one piece of the violent imagery are done concocted with outstanding visual effects, and make even some Hollywood films look basic. Overall, I feel that as long as you can put up with the gore, then you are in for one hell of a ride!",positive
"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is so beautiful and romantic in an absolutely non-icky way, and perfect for all ages. It shows a humans kindness in a whole new lighting.Kakihara and Ichi share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Mike made this film colorful like few others have or could do. Tokyo looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Japan, with Japanese as your mother tongue.It makes you want to do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film.The music goes along with the movie great, it's just right. it sets the perfect mood for the viewer. I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!",positive
"Greetings;In the rather short history of the 7th art their are movies that are above the others... This is one, not only does it have a superb photography, but the plot and personas are really well developed and believable. This movie is one of the greatest Asian film I ever had the chance to watch. So people might say that the violence and sex in the movie make it less credible, but I have to disagree. Most movies are not using sex and violence in an adequate way. Violence and sex are often over used or badly used, but in this movie they are a part of the story. That's why this film is so remarkable, It uses those rather raw elements to accomplish it's goal.
If you have the chance to watch this movie, you should, but be aware, the graphic violence in this movie is one of it's kind, and by far the most violent I have seen my self. As for as the sex, well it's what could be expected from an Asian film. Oh, one last thing, you might not understand the movie the first time, so before judging it watch it twice, and try to understand the personas and the plots itself, you will see everything is perfect...",negative
"Am i a creep if i think a movie mostly about sadism is awesome? You be the judge. I thought this was the most disturbing movie iv'e seen in a long time, and that's what makes it great. Not trying to ruin it, but how many movies have you seen where a man cuts out his own tongue for pleasure???? Not many i bet. There is also some action too, which makes this movie an awesome movie for anyone to see. It gets confusing at times...but other than that...its a gang movie with a serial killer and a sadist...how fun! the end will leave some questioning... Why did he just stick needles in his ears....well....watch...think really hard...and I'm sure you will figure it out...i did.",negative

"This film had me in and just had to watch.  Getting towards the end I wanted the film to end, as the plot was becoming a little stretched.  A film I am looking forward to seeing the un-cut version when it is released this month. A must see for all those who enjoy watching Japanese films as they are very entertaining at times. The translation to english was a little poor at times, and the sub-titles left the screen to quickly, I must say, it didn't really detract from watching the film. Again, if you can get your hands on this film, do so and enjoy.",positive
"Extreme cinema visualized as only the Japanese can...This is probably THE most extreme film I have ever had the (dis)pleasure to watch. Having seen Fudoh, Dead or Alive and his most popular film to date Audition, I thought I had seen him destroy all boundaries of taste and cinema. However, Ichi The Killer finds Takeshi Miike at his most violent, sadistic, stylish and importantly humorous. There is no mellowing for this man, how he comes up with the ideas and characters for some of his films makes me fear for his sanity! Ichi The Killer is also generously laced with some wonderfully Jet Black humour which provides a break from the relentless violence. Some of the violence against women, and indeed some of the violence against the men, is very hard to watch. It is cartoon violence, but as anyone who has seen any of his other films will testify, it is very realistic and not always done with the humour element to provide any mental relief. Rest assured this film will NEVER get an uncut release in the U.K. It also contains some of his best characters, especially the gangland boss who, shall we say carries out his sadistic violence with a VERY large smile on his face Many people with hate, detest or despise this film, but this does not seem to bother Miike who continues to ignore what the Western world feels is acceptable to show on screen, and in a way you have to admire him for that. There is NO-ONE making films that challenge your love of cinema like Takeshi Miike.",negative
"Most people will hate this movie, and not passively.  There is absolutely no way a movie like this would get made in North America, and in away that pleases me, because I'd like to remain somewhat detached from it. Watching this you feel like Romans must have felt watching horrible acts of gore in their arenas.  The most hilarious splatter film i have ever seen, spliced with some rather disturbing comments about a character's desire to rape. It was screened as Ichi the Killer in Vancouver, and the two girls i saw it with absolutely hated it.  However, i must say it was rich with enjoyable characters, and enjoyable ways for those characters to give up the ghost. 8 out of 10.  Obviously not comparable to a movie like memento, but for what it is, a spastic splatter flick, it does its job well.  However I wouldn't feel right giving it more than what I have.",positive
"I am a huge fan of violence, blood and gore on cinema.
I picked this one because it was listed on most disturbing films of all-time (I forgot the source). It was banned on other countries while in some countries it suffered from major cut. I was intrigued and decided to give it a go. I also wanted to test myself if I could stomach it.
The opening scene is actually a warning for the audiences to give some time to think whether to stop or continue watching.
The plot is simple and there's nothing special on it.
The lines are comical and annoying at some time.
The story lack depth.
The support characters are one-dimensional.
The VFX are over-the-top and cartoonish.
BGM are good but not impactful.So what now? Is it a total waste of time?
Absolutely NOT!!!!
The film was able to deliver the most disturbing, disgusting, no hold barred extreme cinematography.
It is tough to watch filled with torture, carnage, and masochism.
It's shock value is over the top as blood, gore and guts are literally everywhere.
The MC are nihilists. There are no likable characters as this movie is definitely an anti-hero movie. However, you will feel their pain and angst as the story progresses.
The surrealism is effective as it adds flavors on the narrative style.
The cinematography, lighting, editing, and camera angles made the film visually stunning and cartoonish as per hyper-violence is concern.
The climax is quite confusing that I have to re-watch that part three times in order to comprehend. It has an open ending and encourages audience's contemplation. In my case, I had to find someone on my telegram groups to discuss it with .
Overall, it's a must watch for hardcore horror hound like me, just be sure you have your barf bag within reach.
After watching this, It's a shame but I have to admit I am one of that Ichi at the opening scene. Satisfied with such insanity and brutality.",positive
"I watched the movie tonight with a few friends in the cinema, as it was the premiere of Ichi the killer on the International Movie Festival of Rotterdam 2002. The director Miike and one of the main actors Asano (Kakihara) gave the audience a few insights during a live interview. The director said that he would be satisfied that if half of the audience would last till the end of the movie. Though I saw some people leaving after the first gore scenes, mostly people remained seated during the whole movie.I was prepared for some extreme action and violence, but there were still plenty shocking scenes left for me. The story isn't really compelling or intelligent, but some scenes are deliberately confusing to give the plot more depth as it seems.A Yakuza group tries to find the murderer of their boss and the stolen money. While they're torturing (which shows a devilish Kakihara) people for more information, they hear about Ichi. His way of killing people surpasses the brutality of their own actions. Kakihara gets obsessed with encountering Ichi, to find the person that can give him that heavenly/hellish pleasure of pain. Ichi has a mentally screwed personality. During the day he sits behind his TV and plays computergames, traumatized by events in his youth, where he has been bullied. The person that uses him, manipulates him to do the murders by showing pictures of the victims and convincing him that they resemble the bullies and should be punished.The movie revolves around sadomasochistic ideas, with emphasis on the sadistic parts. Kakihara is the ultimate sadistic and his torture scenes will definitely shock you. Ichi is the guy that gets beaten up till he gets mad and starts to cry, till he breaks up and starts murdering. His mental state and the way he sees people (in particular women) is very disturbing. He wants to save them and at the same time rape them.This whole movie has a disturbing effect on the viewer, even if you look through the violence and gore. At one moment during the movie, I was thinking: ""Those Japanese are freaks!"", and I'm not actually sure how to rate this movie. It's definitely not for the great mass that likes good-feel/ending Hollywood movies, but worth to see if you want to be shocked and to be left in puzzlement.",positive
"Don't watch if you are offended by: - rape - torture - mass murder - mutilation - sexual violence That warning aside, with the right frame of mind it's a riot.  I found it a little hard to watch, but after a while it becomes pretty desensitizing.
In the entire film, there is not even one single sympathetic character, not even passively benign--so in spite of the violence you can't really feel sorry for any of the victims.  If you can take something so over-the-top, it is an amazing composition.",negative
"This is a very fun and movie. I would recommend, 8/10!-Great characters, worth it just for Kakihara
-bizarre sexual undertones make for a thrilling viewing
-some unnecessary points however but what gore movie is perfect huh?-Extremely aesthetically pleasing, fun colorsThe only drawback is unnecessary points and weird special effects. Still enjoyable.As far as disturbing; you probably see this on iceberg lists, disturbing movie lists, etc. It definitely deserves a place but it is nowhere near the bottom. Was my first 'extreme' movie and I'm glad it was, so fun!If torture and rape bother you don't watch. Much of both.",positive
"The best thing that can be said about Ichi the Killer is that it's certainly never boring.  This tale of Yakuza warfare, repressed psychosis and revenge could have been a much more satisfying film if Takashi Miike knew how to structure a cohesive narrative and when to put a cap on the violence.  Some of the carnage (Ichi's raid on a roomful of gangsters, with blood flying out of the door in torrents, a la Monty Python) is hilarious and has its place in the story, but by the final third of the film, Miike piles on far too many scenes of more realistic cruelty and perversity, seemingly for no reason.At this stage, what was a cleverly enigmatic plot has become much too hard to follow, with characters and relationships randomly introduced and oddly developed.  At times, I wasn't even sure if a character I was watching was someone I'd seen earlier or not!  We never get a grip on exactly who Jijii is and why he is controlling Ichi.  And why are he and Karen suddenly playing a board game, casually discussing Ichi and his hypnosis?Further distancing us from the story is Miike's pacing, which is all over the chart, as if he's controlling the mood by randomly punching different speed buttons on a blender.  If you don't like seeing your film plots (or characters) likewise blendered, avoid this film.",negative
"First off I would like to say I have seen many movies here in the USA and I own over 500 DVDs. I am also an actor with a passion for great movies. I haven't seen too many Japanese/Asian movies but after seeing ""Ichi The Killer"" I will now study up on them. Ichi the Killer is such a good movie I was super surprised. The Violence and Killings in this movie are so ultra realistic you will not be able to finish this movie if you are weak stomached. Now I can take a gory movie better than anyone so of course i sat through the whole movie without blinking but I can tell you that the majority of people will have to close their eyes at certain parts in the movie.The story is about a Very disturbed demented nice young man named Ichi who kills on purpose with full regret after on the verge of a mental breakdown, The Japanese Syndicate (Mobb), Gangs, and Masochistic Torture. The Gore in this movie is done flawlessly. It cannot be anymore realistic. The story is very compelling and so interesting and deep it will leave you jaw-dropped.The actors in Ichi The Killer do a superb job. I am a picky person so if I tell you this movie is one of the best I've ever seen you bet its one of the best. Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) as I read up on is supposedly one of Japan's best actors and is known as Japan's ""Johnny Depp"". And of course the actor who plays Ichi (Nao Omori) was so good I don't see it possibly being any better.Well thats all I'm gonna say for my first comment just see this movie if you like violent, twisted, and crazy movies. Especially see this movie if you like Kill Bill and Anime. If you don't like any of those see this movie anyway.",positive
"Theres not much I can say about ichi the killer with out saying this first, it is certainly a unique movie one that will stay in your thoughts for a long long time(Much like the rest of Takashi Miike's movies). Though some consider it a horror movie among many other things, thought not a horror movie in the normal sense but it does something that most other horror movies fail to do.....It scares you....but draws you in at the same time.....it shocks you leaving a did that just happen look upon your face. Many consider this to be his(Takashi Miike's) best movie.......I disagree with them but do not let that statement steer you away from this unique and amazing movie. Take a step away from the typical crap Hollywood trys to shove down our throats and enjoy a imported masterpiece such as this. Highly recommended",negative
"Yes, it's INCREDIBLY bloody, sadistic, depraved, brutal, insane, violent, and disturbing. It's also satiric, hilarious, thoughtful, and subversive. To dismiss this film as ""childish"" is to dismiss its style and innovation. ""Ichi"" is not for the faint of heart OR mind. You must be prepared to be challenged visually and intellectually. The plot is far more complex than most mainstream American films; it twists upon itself many times and contains several parallel tracks. The imagery pushes the boundaries of what can be imagined, assisted by a healthy dose of CG gore for when physical effects just couldn't cut it. But, as with all great films, it is the characters that drive the story, and this is what puts ""Ichi"" above typical exploitative dreck. The characters are unique, well-rounded, full of flaws and virtues. You may not agree with their motivations, but you will understand them. This film is carefully planned and lovingly crafted; this isn't your old 42nd Street grindhouse fare. If you are seeking a cinematic experience more intense than any you've had before, see ""Ichi the Killer"" before the Moral Majority discovers it.",negative
"I just purchased the Dutch DVD (it has English subs and dubs, so don't worry,) and it completely lived up to any and all hype that I read while researching the film. I am a huge fan of late 70's to mid 80's gore flicks, and I must say that nothing I have seen is as brutally intense as ICHI. I won't go off on any rants about performances or the underlying and darkest of humor present in the film. I think some of the other comments covered all of that quite well. I will, however, repeat that this flick truly needs to be seen to understand the level of brutality Miike captured; psychologically and physically with these unique characters. It's one of those films that makes you question (as a viewer) if you should feel ashamed, or like you've somehow done something wrong for thinking that it kicks ass. ICHI epitomizes the guilty pleasure.",negative
"This film is great.  The scripting of this collision course of the ultimate sadist and the ultimate masochist provides the perfect canvas for Miike to present, in my opinion, a fantastic manga to film conversion.I'll be the first to admit the violence definitely exists in large part to shock but thanks to the casting of Asano also serves to add depth to the character of Kakihara.And it is in his performance that this film truly excells, and it is a pity that it oft goes overlooked in favour of ""OOOh all the blood and rape and violence, quick ban it... BAN IT!!! comments.I love this film because it exists wholly in the grey area of morality and throws two antiheroes together both of whom you root for yet neither of which would normally be deserving of such support. Tandanobu Asano's performance definitely deserves to be remembered amongst the greats, but depressingly probably wont.Awesome film!",negative
"Well someone recommended I should watch this movie since I liked Battle Royale I & II and a few other Asian movies. His response was ""its not that bloody"". Well thats quite the opposite. I felt almost sick after watching it, oh the guts everywhere wasn't too bad, but the torture of the woman hooker did it for me. First time I have ever had to fast forward any movie I've ever watched...ever. And Kahikara's face will haunt my memories for a few days. On a lighter note, I found the plot to be somewhat clever and worked well at following some Mangas I've come across. But in the end, I wouldn't really recommend this. I was expecting a cheesy death type movie (kinda like Starship Troopers) not this sadistic slasher. ;_;",negative
"I am confused by the fact that Ichi hit Kakihara in the forehead with his killer feet, leaving an obvious mark. After he fell off of the building, Jijii moved Kakihara's hair out of the way, showing no cuts (except for the scars that Kakihara did to himself). I'm sure that it was done on purpose (the fact that they made a point to show Jijii lifting up Kaki's bangs is evidence of that), but what exactly happened? Did he really fight Ichi, or was it something ridiculous like Jijii's hypnosis that caused Kakihara to think that he did?Also, I'd like someone to explain to me why it seemed like Ichi, at the end of the movie, was taking a bunch of kids on a walk to see a dead body.",negative
"I will keep this review short, but after watching this film a large amount of times it is still as fun and exciting as when I first discovered it. I understand it may not be for every one but there's a certain charm to it for me and I generally appreciate miike's style of direction. If you watch this film with an open mind and don't take it seriously I think most people will have a good time.I also have both versions of this film and unlike some people I find that the cut and uncut don't really affect the film in that big of a way saying that if you want a more raw ride id go for the uncut version as you may have guessed it has more violence and gore.",positive
"This film by Takashi Miike is by far the worst/best/bloodiest movie I've ever seen.The plot is buried under a lot of confusion and violence, but it is still fearly simple. Ichi is a psychotic young man who has been hypnotized to believe that he is haunted by a memory of ""bullies"" raping his friend in high school and making fun of him. he is guided by a man who has waged a war on the Yakuza, but it seems he is more interested in getting money. Ichi, unwillingly does all the dirty work for his ""master"", though he seems more interested in playing Tekken. (if you think that sounds a little weird just watch it and you'll forget that pretty fast!) His counterpart in the Yakuza Kakihara is a Sado masochist and not shy about showing it. he is ordered to hunt down and kill Ichi, and at the same time wants revenge for his masters death. he tortures and kills those that stand in his way and he fears nothing. He in fact is searching for a worthy aponent to take his life. the movie equally depicts Kakihara and his part in the story. there are many characters with depth in this movie so stay on your toes! This movie is not just violent, not just sick but down right masochistic, that's really the only way to describe it.""Enjoy it while you can"" or should I say ""enjoy it IF you can.""",positive
"This wasn't a bad film. Not even close. However, it was much anticipated. I've come across this film on many Amazon lists in the same category of so called ""disturbing"" films that are not to miss.When I watched the film, it was quite entertaining. The acting was excellent. For its genre it was actually pretty good. However it doesn't live up to the hype. It's basically a Woo movie with a little more graphic violence. One would be better off watching The Killer or Hard Boiled. Each contain comparable violence, although a little softer on the graphic side. Some of the violence in the movie isn't even realistic.To be perfectly honest, screw it, I'm a little tipsy. This movie doesn't deserve to share the same ""can't miss"" movie lists with Eraserhead and other classics. Don't believe the hype. Watch ""Kung Fu Hustle"" instead.Disappointing, yet enertaining.",positive
