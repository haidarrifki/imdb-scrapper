"Absolutely incredible! Who would have thought a zombie flick could be so unique, original and wildly entertaining - and that it could sidetrack you with the most audacious curve ball that will knock you out the park and some (twice). Perseverance is the key, the best things are always worth waiting for and this is one of those occasions where the reward will leave you agog at the genius, originality and imagination conjured up. Brilliant!!!",positive
"My husband and I watched this quite coincidentally a few days after seeing VICTORIA, the 140-minute true single take drama that is one of the most extraordinary accomplishments ever committed to film. After seeing what they had pulled off in that film (powerful performances, action scenes, no less than half a dozen distinct settings, a moving story), we were very underwhelmed by the single take zombie story at the beginning of ONE CUT OF THE DEAD. Thirty minutes in, my husband gave up and went upstairs to do other things. I trusted the glowing reviews I had seen and stuck with it.The film has three acts. They're all fairly amateurish, which is to be expected considering the entire film was made for roughly the same cost as a new car. The first act--the single take zombie action sequence--is especially bad. Really weird pacing, an extremely corny story, and jarring errors that come across as cheap and unprofessional. The second act flashes back six months, showing us how the film-within-a-film we've just watched (i.e. Act I) was originally conceived and produced. This act isn't much better. The acting feels more natural and the story is a little more interesting, with some more meaningful character development, but there's also an extremely awful score and some really poor jokes, so it seems like a wash. Then the third act comes--a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the filming of the film-within-a-film that was Act I.I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me that the third act redeems everything, not only evoking some genuine gut-busting laughter but also pulling off the miraculous feat of teaching you to appreciate the first act--the one you were probably just harshly judging half an hour ago--on its very own terms. Sure, you'll find the first act hilarious having seen it from a new perspective, but what makes this film quite special is that you might also chide yourself for having been so critical of it the first time around. The film-within-a-film has flaws, but even so, it's a pretty impressive achievement. By the time the credits roll (at which point we're treated to actual behind-the-scenes footage, which is just meta upon meta), you'll be cheering the filmmakers (fictional as well as real) for having pulled off the very thing that at first glance seemed unremarkable.Even the corniest B-movie is a small miracle of teamwork, so the film ultimately becomes a celebration of filmmaking and an invitation to step off one's high horse and appreciate smaller acts of triumph. This movie is a very surprising joy.",positive
"ACTION!Some novels trust you to be able to stick with strange decisions and styles to push through to a few final pages or chapters or lines that achieve the near-impossible, they redefine and reframe the previous ones, they shed a new light, and radically change your thoughts on the previous material/project as a whole.That happens in this film. To discuss it any further is to completely ruin it. Suffice to say, it is every bit as good as it is being touted as. It's got clever commentary and a style of comedy that means you can actually be laughing before they even show you anything. I'm still laughing about it today, and I think it even manages to take Zombies and be the first film of this decade to give them a new thematic meaning.It's got a denouement too many, but they've earned it: I watched this film at the Sitges film festival and the filmmakers and cast received a standing ovation, at which, I was almost in tears, not only because they thoroughly deserved it, but also because they managed to make a film about what making a film is about. It captures almost all of what it feels like in an authentic and different way to usual, and it uses its budget to make a film about making a film at that budget perfectly.I have no doubt that this cast and crew (of whom none have a single IMDB headshot image!) will get One Cut of the Dead will get a distributor and achieve worldwide success and acclaim, it's just too special and genuine and innovative not to.And it even manages to correct that fact that it 'should' have been called One Take of the Dead in a way that satisfies a pedant like me! Time to get off my arse and make something...",positive
"Easily one of the most original movies of recent years, 'One Cut Of The Dead (2017)' is best experienced if you know as little about it as possible. As such, I'm only going to talk about it in the vaguest of terms. It's safe to say, though, that I highly recommend you go out and watch it. It's a film that successfully subverts expectation on more than one occasion, displaying an excellent understanding of its audience in the process. Though its second act does slow things down considerably, it's wholly necessary to set up one of the most satisfying finales I've ever seen. Seriously, the final third is absolutely phenomenal and retrospectively makes the affair's first movement (which is done as an incredibly ambitious, thirty-seven-minute oner) even more effective. The film feigns amateurism, but it's actually acutely choreographed and amazingly clever. It's funny, engaging, surprising, energetic, inspired and enjoyable. It's fantastic. 9/10.",positive
So at first you just cringe and laugh at the silliness of the movie. Then you are confused. And then you laugh at how amazing the movie is. The last 30minutes were one of my best movie watching experience.,positive
"Kamera o Tomeru na! (Don't Stop the Camera!) features a 37-minute-long continuous shot that took six takes and makes the entire movie. In fact, as boring as zombie movies have become, One Cut of the Dead makes me forget just how bad things have been the last few years.Like a charming animal-destruction free version of Cannibal Holocaust, the movie has three different ways that the story is told, changing with each new telling of the tale. Higurashi, the director, is losing money and needs to finish his film, but he hates how it kooks. So he makes a blood pentagram that activates real zombies that start biting his crew and actors while he keeps screaming for them to keep shooting, no matter what.And honestly, if I tell you anything that happens after the actress Chinatsu kills him and stands inside the pentagram in a trance, it will ruin what was one of the best movies I've seen in some time.This small movie went on to earn a thousand times its budget. That's incredible and if a film is deserving of that success, it's this one.",positive
"If you don't like violent zombie films, you might still enjoy ""One Cut of the Dead"". Sure, it has blood (as you'd expect) but it is more tongue in cheek and silly as opposed to being gross or gratuitous. So, if you are a parent, you could let older kids watch this one with no serious concerns about your kids becoming warped for life!The story is a confusing one. It's kind of like a movie within a movie...within a movie. Instead of explaining the exact plot, I'll just insist that you watch it and don't worry if you are confused....stick with it.The movie is clever, funny and offers something new and different. And, with so many young filmmakers making zombie films, this one actually offers you some things that are unique and well thought out. Well worth seeing....and a great example of cheap but effective film making.",positive
"Funniest film I've watched all year. Awesome cinematography. Simple plot but it's fun to see how a film shooting went, how problems are handled and tackled, how some things goes out the window, and the sacrifices it takes to make it work. You could say it's a love letter to all the behind the scene crews and filmmakers all over the world. Anyone who's have experience on being one would definitely appreciate and enjoy this film. Highly recommended.",positive
"The first twenty minutes are disconcerting and are almost an invitation to leave the movie theater, cursing the friend(s) who invited you to see this movie. Nevertheless, after the introduction, the movie is quite hilarious. If you like zombies and comedies, this movie is right for you!As a postscript, according to IMDb, the budget is about 25.000 USD. Incredible!",positive
"ONE CUT OF THE DEAD is a typically quirky Japanese comedy that nonetheless manages to cut a swathe through genre cliche by looking and acting like no other. It's a film that's best to watch knowing nothing about it, because it takes the viewer on a real rollercoaster, starting out with you laughing at it and ending with you laughing with it. Or maybe I've just watched too many independent zombie films, because I know exactly what they were getting at here. Great performances, inventive set-ups and a real thoroughness in terms of ability and enthusiasm, this is another winner from Third Window.",positive
"Definitely one of the most unique movies I have seen. For the first third, I was a little confused as to why it was so highly rated and thought some choices were a bit odd; not to say it was bad. The 37min long take was still amazing to watch, just a bit odd at times.However, as the movie begins to reveal its surprise, and I began to understand the genius that was unfolding, it quickly became one of the most enjoyable movies I have had the pleasure of seeing. And so funny! If you can, go in cold to avoid any spoilers.It's also in rare company in that it's one of the few movies that actually made me laugh out loud.",positive
"When I started watching it, I thought it was one of the cheapest, stupidest zombie movies that I had ever seen (and I saw really a lot!). I continued hoping it could get any better, and it does, BIG WAY. The end reveals this movie as one of the best homages ever made to the art of cinema and an hilarious celebration of human creativity.",positive
"I went into this film expecting a low-budget and hopefully less-than typical zombie movie. I'm glad to say this movie turned out to be an incredibly fun watch. Right when you think you've finished up and have gotten exactly what you expected, the film completely throws you in the opposite direction and puts a lens on the genre in such a way that is fun, funny, and outright entertaining. As a fan of both zombie horror and foreign films, I really suggest you check this one out.",positive
"Attempting to film a new zombie movie, the cast and crew find themselves attacked by a horde of ravenous flesh-eating creatures which interrupts the shooting schedule of their production and forces them to actually have to defend themselves from the undead ravaging the set.This was an enjoyable and intriguing effort. Among the many impressive elements throughout this one is the manner in which it pulls off the engaging social commentary about the effects of filmmaking. This one really brings up the idea of what constitutes entertainment as the executives constantly shouting out about what they expect and demand on a live-shoot. The backstage exploits of the industry, filled with egotistical actors stuck in roles they don't want to be in, stressed-out stage-hands constantly trying to appease their bosses and the on-the-fly guerrilla tactics that must be employed to ensure the shoot goes off smoothly feature prominently throughout the second half. There are some fun times ahead here looking at this creation of the film that has plenty to enjoy about it commenting on the rushed nature of filmmaking and how creative individuals must sacrifice their vision to make content for disillusioned executives who only care about the profit lines. As well, the most engaging aspect here is the utterly enjoyable opening sequence. Consisting of a single-take short-length scene featuring the crew being attacked by a zombie outbreak before turning on each other and then chasing each other throughout the complex where they're shooting. Managing to throw in plenty of twists and turns amongst the gory action, all done in one single unbroken take, gives this a wholly unexpected opening that's a real attention-grabber. As the second half of the film is the filming of this very sequence which is full of hilarious antics and ingenious fixes to demonstrate how the actual shot got pulled off. It's quite ingenious to see how the different tricks to accomplish the finish product and the different tricks accomplished to get there which manages to hold this one up as quite enjoyable in these different sections. There really isn't any kind of flaws in this one, as the fact that this one remains as a piece of fiction throughout here without anything else happening does detract this somewhat. The fact that it's all a movie-shoot in both stages does manage to lessen the tension of everything and makes for a cheap experience as none of the attacks mean anything if it's all faked from the start. The goofiness and somewhat crazy feeling present here isn't all that appealing to all, and it might seem odd rather than funny with the way this one plays out. Otherwise, these here are all that really hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",positive
"""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) seems to me as funny as a standard, modern zombie flick can be--even though that hasn't stopped others from fruitlessly trying, or blatantly not trying, to top it: ""Fido"" (2006), ""Warm Bodies"" (2013), ""Life After Beth"" (2014), ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" (2015), ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" (2016), the ""Zombieland"" movies (2009 and 2019), ""The Dead Don't Die"" and ""Little Monsters (both 2019), to name a few. ""One Cut of the Dead"" rises above the bunch by not really being a zombie movie at all, per se, although it's about a zombie motion picture. Rather, it's a meta movie making fun of the making of the film-within-the-film--more ""Day for Night"" (1973) than ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). I like a good undead feature, but thoroughly reflexive cinema offers some of the best the art form has to offer... even if it's supposedly live-broadcast TV and not art.I'm glad I didn't read up on this one before I saw it, either, as what is revealed in the first scene as a film-within-a-film turns out to be yet another, self-referential movie. Moreover, with the last of the end credits, making-of footage is shown of the making of the actual picture, ""One Cut of the Dead."" That's a film-within-the-film, which breaks the fourth wall by addressing the camera for yet another film outside of that, all of which is exposed in the end by footage of the actual filmmaking crew of the overall movie itself--and that, too, leaves a fourth, making-of camera operator unaddressed. In other words, there are a lot of moving parts and layers to the hilarity here. Actors playing actors, actors playing non-actors, an actor playing a director acting, a camera filming a cameraman filming the same fictional director acting as cameraman, too. The absurd premise of a one-shot live-broadcast zombie movie for TV being titled the same as the actual movie without, the same script within, rehearsals, improvisation and coordinated mishaps. Working through the first half hour of what otherwise appears to be an amateurish and over-ambitious piece of awkward and un-worked-out meta filmmaking is made a rewarding experience by the context of further layers of the making of that movie--and of the making of that movie, too.",positive
"A film crew are making a cheap zombie film and realise they have actually unleashed real zombies - or so it would seem.Enjoyable comedy that owes a lot to 'Noises Off' except instead of a stage comedy it's a zombie movie. The second part, where you see how it was done and what and why things didn't go as planned is really funny and wholly believable. A lot of fun.",negative
"Since seeing Jay Bauman of RedLetterMedia and Roth Cornet of fandom Entertainment both place this on their lists as the second best film of 2019, (when it came out in the US) I've been really curious to catch it,but had only seen the title around on a pricey Blu-Ray. Checking what exclusive flicks Shudder has during my free 30 days sign up,and was thrilled to spot it,leading to me finally taking a cut.View on the film:Taking two days and six takes to film perfection, the opening one take 37 minute opening shot from writer/director Shin'ichiro Ueda & cinematographer Takeshi Sone runs in with a breathless atmosphere of the hand held (but not shaky) camera swaying the viewer straight into the zombie onslaught. Making the one cut after the 37 minute mark, Ueda brilliantly makes a stark contrast by taking the crumbly colours of the opening zombie run,into crystallised, crisp digital.Made as part of a acting and directing workshop called ENBU Seminar, (the cast actually paid to be in the movie!) Ueda's adaptation of Ryoichi Wada's play takes the film far beyond these humble beginnings with a incredible, humorous inventiveness, mocking ego-driven directors,as a film maker (played with a unhinged madness by Takayuki Hamatsu) attempts to direct a unfolding zombie apocalypse.Swinging a end to the zombies, Ueda cuts the opening 37 minutes one-shot with a incredible twist,which reveals the shared love of movie making the cast and crew have, visible in each cut of the dead.",positive
"Director Higurashi (Takayumi Hamatsu) is making a low budget zombie movie that illustrates his motto to a tee: ""cheap, fast, but average."" He's got a low-budget cast, a location in an abandoned water filtration plant and a skeleton crew - and more, he's going to make the film in one long take! But as the filming begins, something strange happens; all of a sudden, his crew and cast are becoming zombies themselves. Okay, sounds like a standard scare-em-up zombie flick, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The set-up is actually meant to inaugurate a new all-zombie television channel and the publicity from a one-take half-hour show will be an instant sensation. Only that's not exactly what's going on either....It's important not to give any more of the story away because the whole thing is about as meta as it's possible to be; it is also easily the funniest movie I've seen in practically forever, and while I still have 4 more films to screen at this year's FantAsia Festival in Montreal, of the 11 I've seen so far this one is my absolute favourite! Don't try to tease out more details, just look for this movie wherever you might find it; believe me, you will be ecstatic that you did!",positive
"A bit confused at first, since we don't know what to expect.. but man.. half way through, we GOT it and we couldn't stop laughing.. we even still laughing hard just thinking about it. This movie is pure genius. Highly recommend especially for those who love comedy.",positive
"From the beginning to two thirds of the movie, it looked silly and low-budgety, but at the last 30 minutes of the movie, I was constantly laughing out loud. The turning point starts from the moment when a bold guy drinks water from a wrong bottle. I continued watching the movie expecting there would be a gory twist at the end which could have given a significant impact on this movie, but no. I did enjoy the movie, but I'm not sure if I could recommend it to people by saying, ""stay for the last 30 minutes of the movie"" which would probably be too much of commitment for many.",negative
"This film, a wildly original take on zombie movies, comes in three acts.**Non-spoiler alert. The next paragraph may look like a spoiler, but it's not. The real surprises come much later.**In Act 1 a film crew trying to make a zombie movie is attacked by real zombies. That's not a spoiler. The idea has been around ever since people have been making zombie movies. Carnage abounds for a good 40 minutes.Act 2 is a surprise. But it's short, so don't leave.Act 3, the denouement, is recommended for audiences with strong hearts. I was still laughing the next day.",positive
"Breathing an air of freshness into its ever deteriorating subgenre, One Cut of the Dead is a work of pure exhilarating madness that's honest, heartfelt & hysterical in both its approach & execution, and expertly illustrates the art of filmmaking & unexpected perks of on-the-spot improvisation with its self-reflexive narrative.",negative
"What if you saw a badass film and wanted to see how they shot it exactly? One Cut of the Dead is what you're looking at - a fresh and charming zombie comedy that gets better and better, funnier and funnier with every second. Although there's a brief period of stagnancy in Shin'ichirô Ueda's 100-minute feature film - that has everything from sweet performances to seamless, mouth-watering camera work to laugh-out-loud comedy - you will only remember the good parts of the clever craft. The way the film - the story of a filmmaking crew who camp at an abandoned Japanese Second World War facility to shoot a film on zombies but end up finding real zombies - is structured will make you think about the genius behind the writing for the jokes are multi-disciplinary and beyond creative. Ueda does not only depend on dialogues to create humor but also uses the art of filmmaking itself to make us laugh while also show us how complicated everything is behind a screen. With subtle references to the importance of relationships, One Cut of the Dead excels in almost all departments. It is a film that you watch with your friends in your home theater again and again, year after year. And it is not to be missed. One Cut of the Dead is the reason why we dig zombie comedies so much. TN.(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the 20th MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",positive
"Third time watching this and it gets better every time. Unfortunately, it's also hard to talk about what makes it so good without spoiling it, as it's a film that starts one way and then takes a very unexpected turn into something unique and brilliant, and discovering what the film's actually about is part of the experience.I can say it starts as a one-take zombie film, as you'd expect from the title. It lasts 30-40 minutes, and I do have a feeling it might actually be two cuts- there's a moment where they could have hidden a cut, but I'm not certain. If there's more than one hidden cut, then they've hidden it very well. Even if it's two cuts of the dead, it's still impressive and still leaves the camera rolling for a very long time.This one-cut portion of the film is kind of fun but also drags a little and feels a bit clunky. It gets by through being one cut- I could kind of excuse the more stilted moments, but I can see this part being a turn off for some viewers.Thankfully, once the film begins to become something else after the ""one cut"" first act, it gets great. There's some really funny humour, great characters, really clever moments, and it's even quite touching, too. Keeping it as vague as I can, but if anyone found the first half hour or so to be a struggle to get through, I'd recommend toughing it out to get to the pay-off. It's like a 96-minute long joke that needs about an hour or so of set-up, with the last 30 minutes serving as one of cinema's best and funniest punchlines.A great movie- and probably among the best low-budget/indie movies of the past decade.",positive
"This was the first movie I saw at 2018s Stockholm film festival - what an incredible way to start! I knew almost nothing about the movie when it started and I am happy that I didn't; it created my favorite experience from the whole festival.I want other people to have the same amazing experience that I had which makes it very difficult to write a review. I will give you as much information as I had:One Cut Of The Dead is a low-budget movie about a film crew shooting a zombie movie when suddenly they are attacked by zombies themselves!That's all I knew and that's all I will tell you. Just take my word for it. Make some popcorn, gather some friends and go enjoy this fantastic movie!",positive
"I'm referring to the international title with my ""headline"". But if you've heard about this and kinda got a feel of the vibe, then you may be wary and maybe like me you think: alright, let's see if it is actually any good. It starts off pretty standard and kind of slow paced. Now even if you can see and guess what the movie is doing ... there's still so much to explore.And even while I just knew certain things and was quite sure I knew why they were happening (sorry for being cryptic, but watching this with as little knowledge as possible is the best way - believe that) - it still had me roaring. In a good sense that is. By the end I was more than thoroughly entertained and if you don't mind blood and violence, you will be too. Don't forget: It's just a movie ...",positive
"With the 8.0 score on Imdb and a lot of 10 star review for a horror comedy made in Japan I think everyone including me will find One Cut of the Dead to be a hidden gem in the horror genre, but frankly I'm almost gave up on this movie about 40 minutes in cause not one time I laugh or find anything slightly interesting so at one point I even thought to myself this movie may be one of those overrated trash of a movie that only works with a pretentious crowd but right after that rough start somehow the rest of the movie took an interesting direction that make itself more bearable and this time it actually intriguing me. It still not quite the guts busting zombie movie I hope for and for a movie to took that much time to be interesting then maybe it not a good movie at all but the charming message about film making on low budget I got from One Cut of the Dead definitely make it worth a watch",negative
I would watch this with no context of what the movie is about. Each act of the movie is a totally different experience that expands on the last and makes it infinitely better.,positive
"The first 30 minutes was boring, strange, and dumb. And then it goes bloody brilliant. Literally. The whole thing is fantastic but the second half of this film is super entertaining.",positive
"One of the best comedy movies I have ever seen. Not only funny but highly smart as well. This is the best example of low budget movie done right. You don't need millions to make a good movie. All you need is smart plot and decent actors.
Like comedies and zombies? DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.",positive
I was actually looking forward to seeing this. Ugh! No comedy and no horror. Just God awful. Don't waste your time.,negative
"Japanese contribution to the 21st Century's cesspit of zombie comedies. I just found this to be an incredibly boring movie, it started off looking very very cheap, then what follows is an hour of sheer boredom. Not in the slightest bit funny, I fail to understand all the hype.",negative
"Clever and lots of fun, especially in its second half. Loved the women in this - the director's wife who goes rogue (Harumi Shuhama), his daughter who saves the show behind the scenes (Mao), the sizzling B-movie starlet (Yuzuki Akiyama), and the assistants behind the scenes, one of whom picks up the camera and runs with it.",positive
A movie that manages to re-contextualize itself so many times during its course and keeps you entertained and glued the whole time. So much fun and needs to be seen more!,positive
"Tyrannical hack director Higurashi (robustly played to the ferocious hilt by Takayuki Hamatsu) forces his cast and crew to keep on filming a low-budget zombie horror movie in an abandoned warehouse despite the fact that it's all happening for real. And that's just the half of this very clever and inspired film-within-a-film horror comedy gem.Writer/director Shin'ichiro Ueda not only does a remarkable job of sustaining one single continuous take for the fake thirty-minute horror movie, but also presents a hysterical array of problems for the hapless, yet persistent makers of said fake horror movie that's being broadcast live on television that include egocentric actors, one guy playing a zombie who's totally drunk, a method actress (a terrifically zesty portrayal by Harumi Shuhama) who gets way too into her role, last minute recasting, and an impromptu human crane. Moreover, Ueda also still delivers a handy helping of bloody gore and even generates a good deal of genuine tension. A total hoot and a half.",positive
Really not that good nor funny and tbf the best part of the movie was after the movie showing how they shot all the scenes.,negative
I've been a fan of the zombie genre for 30+ years now and was really looking forward to this but what a let down it turned out to be. Sure the twist if you want to call it that gives a fresh approach to the genre but this isn't a horror movie nor is it a comedy. At least not what I would consider comedy. It's funny in the way that most Japanese comedy is funny. That bizarre game show humour they so often churn out that is amusing for about 5 minutes and then quickly becomes a chore. The first 40 minutes drag until it takes a turn in a new direction and your interest is peaked again but all the while you are waiting for the real zombie horror which is promised in the description of the movie to start again and it doesn't so you are left watching a quite frankly boring behind the scenes remake of what you just watched. What they missed out on here was a triple bluff that turned out to be real therefore having all the cast and crew attacked and killed by genuine zombies but sadly this was missed. This felt like most millenial entertainment these days. Watered down. Selling this as a horror comedy is like when Ed Sheeran is booked to headline a Rock festival. If horror was vegan this would be in that section. What I did like was the small insight into how these things could be made at a low budget level. Crew running around adding fake blood and prosthetics is how i like to think most of my fsvourite horror makers started out with their super 8 cameras. Thats why it gets a rating of 4 and also because I think people who rate movies 1 star are awful human beings who should be fired into space. Sadly One Cut of the Dead will not be gracing the shelves with my dozens of other zombie titles. It should be called One Watch of the Dead as being slowly eaten alive would be less painful than a repeat watch of this.,negative
"Difficult to talk about the film without spoiling it, but I'll try. It is a meta story, a comedy about film making, not a true zombie film. While it was shot on a ridiculously low budget, it references and makes fun of that very process, so when you see horrendously bad scenes, like the very first one in the film, stay with it, because it might not be what you think. Is it a good movie? By all accounts, no, but it has a very refreshing idea that makes it worth watching. It may be more of a film for filmmakers than a real hit for audiences, but at least it is original and was made with love, and that's more than most movies nowadays.",positive
"This movie is a lot of fun, but you have to stick with it to get the joke. If you don't watch it until the end, you won't know what's really going on. If someone told me what the gimmick of this movie was, I probably wouldn't have bothered to watch it. I'm glad I went in cold.",positive
"The cast and crew of a zombie movie find themselves under threat from real zombies, which have been summoned by the director to make his project feel more authentic.To be honest, my brief summary for One Cut Of The Dead is a little misleading, but to reveal any more about the film would be to spoil the fun. I recommend going into this one knowing as little as possible about the plot, so that, as the action unfolds, one can fully appreciate the skill and accuity of all involved. I guarantee that, over the last fifty minutes or so, you'll slowly come to realise that this ain't just another predictable walking dead movie, but a celebration of film-making itself, and you will leave the film with a big smile on your face.Oh, and if you were wondering about the strange title, let me explain: the first 37 minutes consist of one take with no edits. Very impressive considering what is happening on screen.",positive
"I thought long and hard about where I should begin this review and after considerable contemplation, I've resolved that I'll start with ""POM!""When I accidentally stumbled upon One Cut of the Dead, I didn't expect much of it. I genuinely believed that the zombie movies and even zombie comedy movies had been overdone and exhausted. After years and years of zombie movies and now TV shows, what else could possibly be left to explore?""Surely, there couldn't be any surprises judging from the recent mindless additions to the genre of the mindless creatures, right? RIGHT?!"" And boy, was I wrong! One Cut of the Dead might be one of the most enjoyable films I've ever watched.Written and directed by Shin'ichirô Ueda, this film shattered all my assumptions and took me on a ride so entertaining that I think I laughed 30 minutes straight during the entire third act.The film was made in just 8 days with a small budget of around $25,000 and a cast of unknown actors. After it's success at the Udine Film Festival, it was re-released, and eventually grossed $30.5 million worldwide, earning over a thousand times its budget.If that doesn't impress you, the fact that the first 37 minutes of the film is done in ONE CUT should. Some viewers dislike the first 37 minutes and find it challenging to get through. I, however, enjoyed it and found the awkward moments and general cheesiness hilarious.Now, I will deliberately avoid going into the plot for this particular film because I'm afraid anything I say might injure the experience for you. I went in completely blind into this. I watched no trailers and read no reviews apart from one which suggested that sticking with it for the first 30 minutes is worth it because of the incredible payoff. I'm glad I listened to it. Just remember that every awkwardness and cheesiness in the initial 37 minutes has a reason, and the payoff is indeed extraordinary.While performances by the entire cast were wonderful, I was especially drawn by Takayuki Hamatsu (Director Higurashi) and Harumi Shuhama (Nao). I will doubtless watch out for their other works.Lastly, the film makes great use of cinematography, editing, and sound.To wrap up, I'd say Shin'ichirô Ueda's One Cut of the Dead is nothing shy of a masterpiece and is full of originality, humour, wit, and creativity. It amazed me in every aspect and delighted me in forms no film has in a long time. During the last 30 minutes of the film, I remained glued to the screen and didn't think, do or say anything except absorbing what was happening in front of me. I came out on the other side thoroughly impressed, satisfied, and with my face aching from all the hilarity. I will watch out for Shin'ichirô Ueda's other works.POM!",positive
"I was forced to watch this by my friend and his sister. As someone who doesn't like zombies or bad horror movies, I would have turned it off with the first few minutes, but I was a guest and didn't want to be rude. Then the credits started to roll after 37 minutes and I was horrified to be told there was another hour left to go. It was torture, but my friend's sister insisted that it would be worth it. The bad horror movie turned into a hard-to-follow dramatic flashback about the cast and crew of the opening sequence film within a film. It was marginally better, but still not good. Then the day off reckoning came and this godawful movie suddenly became a hilarious comedy of errors that made the first two thirds (almost) worth it. Seriously, if you're going to give it a go, commit yourself and stay until the end.",positive
What a complete waste of time making a movie acting like kindergarten don't bother watching run away fast,negative
"Shudder really pushed it when they compared this to Shaun of the Dead. This was so boring that I nearly fell asleep ten times. Japanese filmmakers should stay away from zombie films, they're as bad as Italian filmmakers when it comes to making trash. I wish I could get my 9 dollars back for the DVD.",negative
"I am pretty sure this won't hold up well on multiple revisits but right now I just had a blast watching this. The less you know about the movie it would be better for your experience but be prepared yourself for nearly 40 minutes long bad crazy opening that is shot in one unbroken take. The rest will have you rolling with it physical gags and humors. Given the fact that this was made with very few budget and unknown cast, this is very impressive, and it is a fresh and unique take on the genre.",positive
"One of the worst movies ever made (and I even like many of the bad movies). It tries to be different, original, but it is just plain bad. You have been warned.",negative
"Everyone by now knows this is 3 movies into one, it starts as a bad grade c zombie movie that turns into a one shot zombie movie that turns into a making off movie...The idea is good, but it needed the acting in the zombie movie and the making off part to be top notch, and frankly it's all pretty bad. And it has a horrible quirky score that makes everything very cringy.Also the making off part is supposed to be a comedy, and nothing is actually funny because it's all badly acted and that music made me wish there was a 4th part in which real zombies came and ate all the actors and it finished as a really scary movie. But no, it just ends and I wasn't scared and I didn't laugh once. The POM thing everyone keeps mentioning is fun, and that actress is probably the best thing in the movie by far.I give it 5 stars because it's a good idea and it was made for super cheap, also the one cut part was smartly done when you realize later that some of the awkward moments were improvised because everything was falling apart while they were filming it.Normally I hate American remakes of Japanese movies, but im this case I think it has a lot of potential if someone makes into a genuinely scary zombie movie with good acting.",negative
"A great comedy done through Zombie Horror as the base of movie. However, i felt a little boredom in between and thus would cut 1 point. Overall, a must watch.",positive
"If you think the movie is bad, please stay until the last 30 minutes. It's genuinely creative and super fun!",positive
"At first I must admit that I was somewhat thrilled to stumble upon the 2017 ""One Cut of the Dead"" (aka ""Kamera o Tomeru Na!""). But then a seed of doubt was planted because many other zombie movies from Japan have been questionable at best.But still, it is a zombie movie, and that is more than enough to make me sit down and watch a movie. And thus I did so with ""One Cut of the Dead"". Well, at least for a whole staggering 35 minutes. Then I gave up from sheer boredom, frustration and lack of entertainment.This movie was bad, really bad. It was essentially just a movie about people running around like mindless chickens, screaming and yelling, while being chased by zombies with very, very animated arms and legs movements. It wasn't even funny to look at.And it didn't help much that the characters were more boring than wet cardboard. The choices that the characters in the movie took made absolutely no sense, not even in a stressful situation. It was just idiotic and embarrassing to witness on the screen. But staying true to it being a low budge movie, they had the talents to match the level of the movie.The zombie make-up and special effects were as to be expected for a low budget movie such as this. So don't expect a grand macabre visual tour de force here.There was just nothing in this movie that had any appeal to me, and after enduring for a staggering 35 minutes, I just gave up, never to return to watch the rest of the movie. I had hoped that it might have been as much fun as ""Toilet of the Dead"", but it wasn't. This was just plain and downright boring.",negative
"One cut of the dead tell a story of ""a small crew of zombie movie get attacked by a real zombies"".
Get bore at first 30 minute but once they got real with what truly is happening on 1/3 i got real hooked as i never seen movie quite like this before i get real excited as thing slowly reveal.The humor is what u expect from japan movie with the same genre,the character is great,the idea amazing.The most honest movie about filmmaking i ever seen,absolutely makes me want to check similiar type of movie.",positive
"I watched this after reading some of the glowing reviews on here. I love zombie films and horror comedies but this is just hopeless. Someone else said 'if you don't like it at first, stick with it' or something similar so I ploughed on expecting it to get better.It really doesn't. I watched two thirds of the film and sort of smiled once, normally if I watch half a film and don't like it I'll watch the rest because I've invested so much time already but I gave up on this. It's a film about the making of a film, the zombies are people pulling faces, the gore is rubbish but the worst part is it's just not funny.Maybe the last third/quarter of the film it suddenly gets hilarious but I doubt it. If you're prepared to sit through an hour of boring first to find out then give it a go",negative
"Just when you thought there were no more original ideas left in the Zombie genre, along comes a film that I can honestly say is completely unique. The horror is mild at best, and the comedy isn't slapstick, or punchline based. Rather the film dissects the process of indie film making and makes you laugh at yourself for what you've grown to tolerate from the genre.",positive
"My Rating : 9/10'One Cut of the Dead' is a very low-budget (~ approx. $27,000) zombie comedy that must be seen by anyone interested in film-making. It's unique and unlike anything I've ever seen and in a very, VERY good way.This is 1 hour 36 mins long and not just the first part which is 36 minutes so make sure to watch the whole thing as it gets infinitely meta and hilarious!This one guarantees an awesome ride from start to finish and is a MUST WATCH!",positive
"The beginning starts really boring, but when it comes to the making, there are quite some funny scenes..",positive
"Another hype i just can´t seem to share.First thirty minutes are a cheaply made ""zombie"" flick, with much annoying overacting and screaming. The rest seems to be a documentation about how they did it.. even more annoyingly done.",negative
"Much better then the beginning lead to believe.
its a comedy and a very good one.
its about a movie about a movie about a movielol
good story/directing/cast.
again,there is a reason 1/3 third seem to suck.",positive
"An interesting take on the Zombie movie phenomenon that develops a multiple layered plot based around a failing director given his last chance at the big time.Or so it would at first seem. Without giving too much away, this is a film that uses to creative sphere of filmmaking as a vehicle.Just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong on this shoot and to make things worse, the crew are gradually picked off by zombies. Except that they aren't.What we are looking at isn't actually real and while this film is funny and scary in places, I felt it was trying a bit too hard to be clever. It skirts very close to parody and the ending is as cheesy as it gets.It's worth watching but it's really not a horror movie in the true sense, it's actually a feel good comedy with the occasional scare and zombies attached.",negative
"One Cut of the Dead is the kind of film you ought to watch without reading the plot or checking out the trailer. It's a tale of 3 acts, each with its own set of surprises. The first act is your straightforward zombie movie, but the remaining two are where the film fully embraces its inventive meta concept. Refreshingly written, performed, and shot, the final 30 minutes of One Cut of the Dead will have you rolling in laughter, leaving you awestruck by the sheer meta-ness. It blurs out the lines between reel and real: a movie-within-a-movie (within another movie?) that deserves every bit of praise, especially given its minuscule budget.",positive
"I've watched several zombie movies in various languages. Be it Korean, English, Hindi, Telegu, Bengali, I've seen all kinds of Zombie films. After visiting these films I became fan of ZOM COM genre.Whenever I watch a new ZOM COM movie I instantly become fan of that. For example Shaun of The Dead was my favourite zombie movie, then I watched Zombieland, then Go Goa Gone in Hindi, then Zombie Reddy in Telegu. And now I just finished this movie - ONE CUT OF THE DEAD in Japanese.Writing is the STRONGEST POINT in any ZOM COM. This movie is DIFFERENT as compared to all other ZOM COMs. Because here not just the writing but everything is unique. All the crew members have done a GREAT job with this small budget. Loved all the actors, enjoyed every single moment.You may not like the first 38 mins, but trust me after that it will be a SURPRISE PACKAGE for you.If you're a genuine movie lover or wants to become a filmmaker this is A MUST WATCH.Thanks to Aritra's Gyan (Bengali Youtube Channel) for the Recommendation. This movie will be with me for a long time.Available on MUBI.© MandalBros.",positive
"Do not trust the reviews for this one. There are lots of good Asian movies(Kung Fu Hustle, Oldboy, The Raid, Man from Nowhere, I saw the Devil, etc), but this is mediocre at best. The movie looks good for the budget, but it is not a quality comedy flick, and definitely doesn't qualify as a horror comedy. Maybe some Asian people would find it funny due to cultural differences, but beyond that I cannot comprehend the good reviews. This was painfully unfunny. I give it 2 stars for looking good considering the budget, and one star for a slightly original take on the zombie genre, but that is all. Save your time and watch Kung Fu Hustle for a better comedy.",negative
"While making a zombie film, zombies attack. Not going to spoil the film, but let's say it lets us know that in any reality TV show there is also a director, sound man, and a cameraman standing right there.It was a mildly fun film. Most likely lost a little in the translation.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",negative
"The Good: I don't usually do spoiler reviews, but it's kind of impossible here. I've seen this movie with multiple people, multiple times and every time, someone checks the Rotten Tomatoes score and is shocked. I would go into this with NO context whatsover. It makes the experience even greater.The film starts with possibly one of the worst zombie films you or I have ever seen. It's weird, it's amateurish, it's laughable. The characters do and say things that make absolutely no sense. It seems to be directionless.BUT THEN, we get the reveal 1/2 hour in. The REAL movie begins and it's one of the most charming, enjoyable things I have ever seen. The film isn't a zombie movie at all, it's a celebration of cinema and the magic of movie making, as a team of filmmakers attempt to do a one-take, live zombie movie for a TV special. We see the process, the behind the scenes and the entire final act explains all the weirdness of the beginning. We even have fun, endlessly watchable characters and one of the sweetest endings I have ever seen. This is a tonal shift done AMAZINGLY.The Bad: the main guitar score conveys a light hearted, fun tone, but it's a bit *too much* at times. It' verges on corny and reminds me of a TV show. But honestly, that's really the only bad thing here.The Ugly: I love how this movie manages to make poop and vomit jokes funny again. Also, I died laughing every time I heard ""POM."" You'll get it when you see it.",positive
"It's honestly way to difficult to explain why you need to see this film.
Especially since the unique style, the way it was shot and put together would be a severe spoiler to your experience. Going in as blind as possible is my advise.
So let me just tell you, that you will enjoy this film if you:
A: Like B-movies
B: Like Slasher Horror Movies (Especially related to A)
C: Like Characters with character (No black/white BS)
D: Like Comedy (Especially related to the above)
E: Like Unique and Inventive Films
If you are into all these points you will absolutely love this film.
Guaranteed.
I'm just dazzling with excitement from having watched such a beautifully different film again. It really cleanses the pallet, if you don't mind my french.",positive
"Have you ever watched a movie and thought to yourself that wasn't bad but I don't think I'd watch it again. Then a few days go by and you start thinking about that movie. You find yourself laughing at funny items, finding scary items now more frightening and dramas more dramatic than when you first watched the movie. Then you realize maybe I need to watch that one more time. I found myself that way with ONE CUT OF THE DEAD.The movie is actually three movies in one, though the first is incredibly short. We open with a zombie attacking a young woman, clearly terrified but sad because the zombie was apparently her boyfriend. As he moves in to bite her and the scene ends it actually, well ends. It turns out what we're watching is a zombie movie being made with actors in the roles. End movie one.The director is a bit of a megalomaniac, a man who suffers for his art, demanding certain things from his cast and crew. They stop for a break and while sitting together they discuss the location. It turns out the director chose it because it is supposed to be haunted. It's little surprise then when screams are heard and an arm is tossed into the building. Thinking it's a prank that turns to terror when the arm's owner enters bleeding profusely. Yes the zombies are an actual thing here.As the cast and crew members untouched and uneaten try to survive they run around the building being chased by flesh eaters. They run around outside the building. They discover weapons out of the blue on the property. Dead members rise up again clearly not undead yet. You watch and think to yourself while laughing is this the worst zombie movie ever made? And then the credits roll. Only 30-40 minutes into a movie clocked at 96 minutes. What in the world? End movie two.The reason is that we go back in time and find out what brought this movie about to begin with. It was planned as a live zombie presentation to be on par with the original WAR OF THE WORLDS. The director they hire is the director we saw earlier. He's a lot more humble though. This is because the actor meant to play the part didn't show. Some of the cast members are missing too. To replace them he uses his wife as an actor since she did that in the past and his daughter on the crew.We watch as the entire team is assembled and the cast is chosen. We see rehearsals take place. We get to watch the interaction among everyone. And we begin to see that this film isn't so much a tutorial about how to make a zombie flick so much as a comedy of errors that gets funnier the further in it goes.SPOILER ALERTAll of the mistakes and funny things we found in the movie itself turn out to be the result of creative off the top of their head decisions made as the film move forward. This is where much of the humor stems from, watching as the director attempts to keep this live movie going while dealing with everything from lost actors to drunk actors to having to take on a screen roll himself. But there are more surprises as well.The movie was made in Japan in 2017 but is making its way to disc now. RLJ Entertainment has released it with collectors in mind in a steel box edition. The extras are minimal but that's okay, it is the movie that makes this worth watching and perhaps picking up for horror or comedy fans. And while the title may make many think that this is a horror film it's actually more of a spoof about the making of movies.As I said at the start I wasn't overly impressed on my first viewing. But the more I found myself thinking about the film the funnier it got. It's a bit twisted humor at times and near slapstick at others but it really is better than I realized. So much that I may have to watch it again this week.The odds are you won't find this for rental at any nearby locations but that doesn't mean you can't watch it. SHUDDER streaming service is featuring the film right now. It can also be rented on streaming services like amazon prime. And if you want you can also order your own copy if you choose.",positive
"Let me tell you why you need to see this film... blind... and while it's still in theatres.First, it's a hell of an endeavor that I skipped at the Batsu Japanese Film Festival last year (didn't think it'd be that interesting) and am so~ glad Alamo Drafthouse decided to screen for its USA release. It's funny, interesting, and a hell of a trip that just spins you round before leading you down a strange unknown path. Trust its direction. You'll be impressed by all the places you go.Second, it gives the impression of being a love project of people who felt the need to challenge themselves with something, let's say, unusual and notable. They should probably be awarded for what they accomplished and, honestly, we should reward this behavior so we get more of it.Third, if you aren't in the film making industry it'll probably make you see films a different way since it gets into matters that I don't recall ever seeing portrayed in a film before. There's no way to properly explain this without spoiling things that should never be spoiled, so I'll leave it there.
Side Notes:1) Beyond the description, this film is so worth seeing blind. The Shudder Exclusive trailer (Alamo's preview) is very spoilerful and the SGIFF 2018 trailer is minorly spoilerful. Daniel Ott was right, ""the less you know the better.""2) According to John Squires' brief Bloody Disgusting article (contains spoiler image), OCD will be released on the Shudder streaming service on Tuesday, 9/24th.3) It's so funny that it should be seen with a large audience so you can all enjoy the laughter together.4) Stay for the credits.
Disclosure:I discussed the film with another immediately after watching it.",positive
"This was a film that a couple of my favorite podcasts talked about and how much they liked it. They both said they really couldn't talk about it as it is quite hard to do so, because you really need to spoil it. This review could be a bit short, because I don't want to do spoilers myself. My first watch of this was at the Gateway Film Center for their one day showing and now I've seen this movie twice more at home. This last viewing for the Summer Series for The Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is things go badly for a hack director and film crew shooting a low budget zombie movie in an abandoned WWII Japanese facility, when they're attacked by real zombies.We start this as a crew is filming a zombie movie. The star is Ko (Kazuaki Nagaya) and his co-star is Chinatsu (Yuzuki Akiyama). Ko is a zombie and Chinatsu is pleading with him to wake up. He goes to bite her and they cut. The director is Higurashi (Takayuki Hamatsu) and he goes off Chinatsu as well as Ko. The make-up artist is Nao (Harumi Shuhama) and she tries to calm everyone down. It is decided to take a break.Chinatsu, Ko and Nao go off together and she tells them the urban legend about the place they are at. Things take a turn when it comes true and they're attacked by zombies. It becomes a fight for survival until we realize what is really going on here. It might be even more stressful than what we originally thought it was. We also can't always believe what we are seeing.Just to give you an idea, what I recapped there is literally the first 30 minutes and an extremely vague hint at what we get after that first section. I was kind of confused with my initial viewing, because I didn't know where they could go from there. What I will say is that after this point, I ended up loving what this movie is doing. As someone who has worked on a feature length film, I can definitely say that helped me to enjoy this even more.I should warn you though; this first half hour is a horror comedy, where the rest of the film is definitely more of a comedy with horror elements to it, to an extent. I would say that these elements though might not necessarily be in the traditional sense. I'm not always the biggest fan of the blending of these two genres, but in this case, it worked for me. It also doesn't necessarily build tension though like most movies would, but that's not to say there isn't stress. Something I do need to say is there's some good writing of things introduced and then referred to later. I'm definitely a sucker for that.To avoid going into spoilers, I'll move to talking about the pacing and editing of the film. Something I noticed is that the title of the movie is a play on words. We get what looks to actually a good section that is one cut with some interesting camera movements. I never got bored though, so that is definitely a perk and I love how this ends up playing out. Something that struck me with this last viewing, the camera work is even more amazing with considering the different things to hide. I'm still impressed after three viewings.That will move me to the acting, which is also good. We have Hamatsu who is actually fed up. We see his blow up in the first 30 seconds, but it all makes sense later in the movie. I thought this was genius, because it establishes at first that he's crazy. That isn't necessarily the truth though and you can't fault the guy after seeing what he's put up with. Akiyama and Nagaya are both good as the young leads of this film. They both are kind of annoying people, but they play this role very well. Shuhama is solid as was Mao who is playing a character of the same name. The rest of the cast rounded out the movie for what was needed.Since this is a low budget, found footage film, the effects were done practically and look great. I like that when someone becomes a zombie, they have these odd glowing eyes. We get some blood that looks good and how the zombies move was realistic, again to an extent. They are making a bad zombie movie, but not necessarily on purpose. I didn't really have any issues here and the found footage aspect is shot well. It adds a layer of realism to this movie.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. Despite this being a take on found footage, we are getting some music and it does fit for what they're going for. It doesn't necessarily stand out though. It is interesting that with the sound design you can hear things off camera, which adds to the comedy when you see what was really going on.Now with that said, this film was one that I had expectations coming in with since people I respect opinions were on high on it. Since this film is hard to talk about, they were cryptic and unsure of what I was getting into, much like I'm trying to be here. I liked the first 30 minutes, but at the reveal of what is going on, I really ended up loving it. I think the found footage; low budget zombie angle works well. It is a horror/comedy, which can be hit or miss for me and this one really knocked it out of the park. We get a combination of situations and actors just being funny. That leads me to the acting being good. The effects fit for what was needed and the soundtrack did as well. I found this to be a good movie overall.",positive

"Perhaps for some time now, cinema has been lacking in original ideas for stories, meaning that style is becoming more important. CGI, films shot entirely on green screen and the failed attempt at 3D have seen special effects used as a way of overcoming this. But as hipsters love independent movies, increasingly there seems to be a move towards special effort, as opposed to effects.While not an overall excellent film, 2017's ""Ice Cream and the Sound of Raindrops"" was shot in one sixty-plus minute take, including various locations and musical interludes along the way. And the ""Inside No. 9"" team revisited the idea of filming a live episode last year. Relative unknown director Shinichiro Ueda's ""One Cut of the Dead"" (or more appropriately the Japanese title: ""Kamera o tomeru na!"" / ""Don't Stop the Camera"") - a film within a film within a film - combines this use of a single take with the perils of trying to shoot scripted material live.In an abandoned army facility, a girl is attacked by her zombie boyfriend. Except that she isn't. Chinatsu (Yuzuki Akiyama) is a low-rent actress starring in a zombie film directed by the erratic Higurashi (Takayuki Hamatsu). Dismayed at her forty-second take failure, they break from filming. But as they wait around, the small crew are attacked by zombies - Higurashi knowing that the location has a ""history"" of army experiments.What follows is a one-shot chase as the survivors try to escape their newly dead attackers, with awkward dialogue, strange behaviour, blood splattering and breaking the fourth wall. The sole survivor, Chinatsu is left standing on the roof of the facility, staring up at the slowly and awkwardly rising camera as the end credits then scroll up the screen.But we haven't got there yet.It is after this thirty-plus minute single take that ""One Cut of the Dead"" actually begins. A month earlier, Higurashi is approached by producers from the ""Zombie Channel"" to film a single-take zombie film to be broadcast live in the afternoon - his ""cheap, but average"" style seemingly what they're looking for. Something of a hack director, he is initially reluctant, but is too weak to say ""no."" As such, he takes on the role and is introduced to his cast and crew: a less than inspiring bunch.After a troubled preparation, the day of the shoot comes, but as they prepare for their risky move, everything that can go wrong goes wrong. As such, Higurashi and his crew are left to improvise and get by as best they can, making sure to follow the mantra: ""kameru o tomeru na!""Itself a film made on a very small budget, I'd seen a lot about the record-breaking profit levels that ""One Cut of the Dead"" had already made and the strong social media marketing efforts by the cast and crew. As such, I chose to read little about the film itself before seeing it, trying to remove all ""Blair Witch"" comparisons and expectations.Not just a film within a film within a film, this is essentially the film, making-of and bloopers all-in-one. To start the ""one cut"" is a breath-taking ride of hilarity; seemingly baffling acting, behaviour and dialogue; blood splattering; gore; talking directly to the camera; various mistakes; and what must be a very tired cameraman. As the initial end credits roll, we're left thinking ""o-kay.""The film's second part offers explanation as to the above, in what is a witty, well-crafted script to create all of the mistakes that appear in the live broadcast we're thrown into. The stress and pressure the crew are put under shows, with none worse affected than Higurashi and his wife, Nao (Harumi Shuhama), drafted into the production late on. Both go rogue, not so much acting, as letting their frustrations out - the director determined to make the shoot work for the sake of his art.The television producers, while setting the difficult task, are less concerned by the art, embracing the chaos. Indeed, much of the middle section of ""One Cut of the Dead"" feels like a Japanese TV drama; the style of shooting and music feeling very much part of a Japanese small screen. But this is a film made for the big screen and a big audience. The laughter track provided by a big crowd adds to the undoubted fun that this is. Ueda shows that a lot of ideas that come out of a live shoot will be improvised out of necessity, and has fun in doing so. The laughs are big, the timing spot-on and the acting suitably awkward.But while showing improvisation is necessary, Ueda's film is one that has been carefully thought-out and choreographed, like a well rehearsed stage production. The cast and crew have obviously been challenged in making this, and the crew's efforts are shown as the actual end credits roll in true Jackie Chan fashion: the ""making-of"" cameraman following the actual camera and sound men as they take a well-earned drinks break as the camera continues to roll.",positive
The people who are giving this film bad reviews either didn't understand what it was about or didn't watch past 37 minutes. I enjoyed this film and appreciate the trouble they went through to make it. Amazing.,positive

"Fast? Yes, indeed, this little movie has great pace.Cheap? No, it did NOT cost very much, but the filmmakers made the most of their resources.Average? Not hardly.""One Cut of the Dead"" details what happens as a film-making crew shoot their low budget zombie movie inside an old, abandoned building ""with a past"". Wouldn't you know it: they soon are attacked by real zombies.Although this *seems* to wrap up quite early, that is NOT the end of the story. Without my giving away all of the twists of ""One Cut of the Dead"", this takes you on an interesting ride as you see all of the travails of shooting a zombie flick on a budget - complete with a drunken cast member, and necessary improvisations when things don't go as planned.This is creative, energetic stuff with some very kinetic camera-work, and very entertaining gore. The cast members easily give it 100%, with Takayuki Hamatsu an utter hoot as a brow-beating director. Harumi Shuhama is also wonderful as the makeup artist Ms. Nao. There is a lot of catchy rock and pop on the soundtrack, and quite a bit of humor as well as some heart.This is one of those movies where you really have to watch the WHOLE thing in order to appreciate it, so it won't pay to give up on it early. It's one of the most endearing efforts in an over-crowded sub-genre that this viewer has seen in a while.Eight out of 10.",positive
"Suppose to be a low budget single shot no editing (i.e. one camera films all scenes in sequence; no stopping) live TV presenting of a zombie short movie.
At first I thought it was the cheapest movie made in the last decade+ - that's part 1. Part 2 wasn't clear, but supposedly the film crew gets attacked by a couple of real zombies. Where they came from & why; who knows. Part 3 made what I thought was a wasted hour more interesting as they showed with a second camera the behind the scenes process of making a horror movie (e.g. where the blood & bodies come from). Nothing surprising, but fun to watch.",negative
"Amateurish, like watching a high school production.
The humour is forced & the shaky camera man makes my head goes dizzy...Pretty bad....UUGGGHHH!!!!",negative
"Don't waste your time on this one. As a lover of zombie movies this was a major let down. What initially caught my attention was the meta plot. I liked the idea. However after the first few minutes I could tell this movie falls below an acceptable level of quality. The acting, directing and plot are all sorely lacking. I turned this movie off after roughly 20 minutes and don't plan on finishing it. It's EXTREMELY rare that I don't finish a movie.Do not trust the reviews on this. Also, if you'll notice you'll see that all the reviews stating this movie was not good are getting downrated by scores of people. My guess is that it's the actual crew and friends of the crew doing that. I wish that could be prevented.I don't like giving very bad reviews do movies because people spend their time, money and emotion making movies but this movie is deeply inferior in many ways and not fit for watching if you enjoy watching good movies.",negative
"At the end it was just an ambitious project.
I'll put any movie that's a one cut with zombies on my watchlist but this movie proved to be so much more.",positive
"After the first 15 minutes of terrible ham acting, pauses in action, awful cinematography, and an 'missing' arm clearly visible under the person's shirt, I gave up.",negative
"One Cut Of The Dead; Japanese Zombie Comedy which opens with a typical scene from a low budget zombie film but the fourth wall quickly vanishes as a bullying director berates the actors. He acts like He's Kubrick, 42 takes of a scene. The film set building was built for water filtration but there's an urban legend about the army using it for medical experiments to bring dead people back to life. The crazed director draws a Pentagram in blood and succeeds in summoning up Zombies. A pretty enjoyable Zombie (short) film ensues, cameraman thinking an actual Zombie is an actor, is turned. Much biting, decapitation, running about and hatchets in heads Great dodgy effects. But then things get more meta as the film turns to the making of the making, of the making, of the Zombie film (you have to see it). So we have a Zombie film with added satire and laughs operating on as many levels as there are in the film itself and there are more twists than you can shake a stick at. Amazingly the film was made on a budget of $25,000 but it grossed $61 million at the box office. Shin'ichiro Ueda directed, edited, and wrote the script for One Cut of the Dead. 8/10.",positive
"My title says it all. It is a experience, a trip. This what movie making is about - to break all the rules. I am happy that something like this has been made. This kind of films inspires you. Great work.",positive
"This Japanese zom-com is one of the freshest and cleverest movies, in the saturated zombie sub-genre, in recent years - but it might not entertain as expected.I enjoyed it despite the fairly sluggish build up but did not find it to be exceptionally funny.I'm not entirely sure what didn't work too well but I didn't find myself laughing as much as the others in the audience. That being said, there was plenty of laughter so I might have been in the minority.The humour resembles the slapstick elements one might see in Rat Race or Johnny English, just with a bit more blood and splatter, albeit fairly reserved.If the majority of people don't enjoy this film, I'd be fairly surprised but you probably need to go into it with as little knowledge and expectation as possible.",negative
"After 30 minutes of awkward zombie movies with dreams, efforts and creativity, it was a take-off shooting record, which showed how pitiful a mirror really was. Good movies will not be buried, while domestic movies will only make money.",positive
"Yes, everyone would consider giving up on this film 30 minutes into it.But sit tight, keep faith, and let it finish. Then you'll understand why you necessarily had to endure that first 30 minutes. You'll be treated with quite a good laugh in the end.",positive
Every time the director screamed that I died laughing. Hilarious. I backed it up the first time and said did he just scream action. Lol Great writing. I almost turned it off when the middle credits started rolled. Glad I didn't and was distracted.,positive
"Spoiler Alert! if you expect this movie to be another zombie movie, be ready to get disappointed, since it's actually all about making a zombie movie with limited budget and limited crews, IN JUST ONE TAKE!!! the result? wasn't so great: the crews keep making mistakes, the actors/actresses keep trying so hard at improvising that results on some awkward moments, the people behind the camera keep getting nervous and so on and so on. But, that's actually where all the fun and laughs lie.I don't know if you have the same thought or not (and I don't really care), despite the difference in plot, the theme that runs in this movie kinda reminds me of 2006's ""Little Miss Sunshine"", where accepting a challenge or joining a contest, despite our poor performance and people's view on it, will make us happy and be proud of who we are. Because the real failure is not when we fail at our first try but instead, when we never try at all, and regret about it later in days to come.",positive
No no no!! you all have seen much much better than this!!! this is insane!!! i don't undertand the good reviews!! this movie is not even worth of being called a movie!! if you are a movie lover you will know what i mean!!,negative
"This screened at BiFAN in Bucheon, Korea in July, 2018. This was far and away the funniest film, with the audience laughing solidly as the story progressed.Spoilers:
It is a film within a film within a film. Another way to put it is, in talking to Shinichirou-san...""how did it feel directing an actor playing a director directing himself as an actor playing a director?""About 39 minutes of the worst zombie movie ever, done in one take (they pulled it off on the 6th take). This is followed by cutting back in time, and following the development and production of this indie film (all scripted), culminating in the filming of the take with cuts to show the improvisation involved. Not just a fantastic comedy, but this film does a good job of documenting the process of getting out an independent production in Japan.Now to find it some exposure in North America so I can rewatch it with my friends.",positive
"A wholesome Zombie-Comedy coming straight from the land of the rising sun. A film that I wasn't even aware of existed until a couple of hours back. So what is this about? It's Meta-Cinema at its peak. To put it in layman's terms, it's a movie about a movie that is inside of a movie. My selection of words may aggravate the level of confusion here but need not worry, it's not as confusing as my verbal communication skills may otherwise suggest.If you consider yourself one of those Zombie movie enthusiasts, then you're going to love it. Not only the film is filled with eccentricities but it also delivers equally on both aspects of subtle humor and slapstick comicness. To be honest, it is one of the silliest, dumbest yet inventive pieces of work I have ever laid my eyes on. Not without its caveats of course, they always have flaws, nevertheless, I didn't expect I would find this many moments to savor.",positive
"The movie is terrible. Action was bad, and the comedy was bad (what little there was). So many reviewers are using the term ""meta"" like it's somehow a smart film. It's not. It's just bad and definitely has a bunch of padded fake reviews, it's literally the only way to explain its high ratings.",negative
"The first thirty minutes seemed to be a cheesy and cheap zombie flick and then the movie actually staterted. The director was assigned for the live and one cut zombie movie program on a tv channel. She has a wife that's forbidden to act because she was carried away and broke an arm in an action movie and a daughter who's in love with the main character in the program. We saw then how the cheesy zombie flick actually got out of control and shot freestyle. The wife and the director replaced the two actors that had an accident on the way to the abandoned building. The diarrhea guy, the main handsome guy getting slapped by the wife, how they made a crane by humans when their cranes fell off the building and was broken, the way how the director guy improvised, the drunk old actor it was all so hilarious. I love how those cheesy weird scenes in the first part made sense one by one. I was expecting to watch a horror comedy but ended up watching the most hilarious and intelligently edited movie that I've seen lately.",positive

RECOMMENDEDSuper cool zombie horror which requires patience to enjoy the real flavour... I was bit underwhelmed by the starting scenes and loosing interest on the first part... other than the ""single shot"" making, there is nothing interesting in the first part.... Found some scenes were so repeating and unnecessary....
When the second half starts, all the first half scenes starts to make sense...the second half is full of fun riot... they justifies each and every frame in the first half...
The best part is the final making video... it was so great and super fun to watch. The sentiment aspect was so handled well, when the daughter shows the photo to her father.... touching....
The full package horror movie to enjoy by every zombie fans....",positive
"""I was worried how things would go, but the show went well without any trouble. Arigatou gozaimashita!""For the first 50 minutes I was confused on why this movie was so highly praised. It's kinda funny and looked like an amateur work.Then the last half came, and now I understand the hype. This was definitely one of the most ingenious concept and execution. It explained the cringe footage at the beginning of the movie, and made it so damn hilarious. Even more, there's just enough character development to unexpectedly add some emotions to the story.It's a damn brilliant and hilarious movie. 9.5/10.",positive
"For of all, ""Things go badly for a hack director and film crew shooting a low budget zombie movie in an abandoned WWII Japanese facility, when they are attacked by real zombies."" is an utterly false synopsis. They do not meet ""real zombies"" and this is in no way a zombie movie. It's not even a film they are shooting, but an episode of a TV show. All this film is is a typical Japanese movie about a group of losers doing ""gambaru"" (roughly translated: perseverance). Japanese people love this kind of ""success in the face of adversity"" stuff. It's like a modern version of Andy Hardy's ""let's put on a show, boys and girls!"" and just as dated. I was told the film was ""hysterical,"" yet I sat through the whole thing with a stone face, as did my (Japanese) girlfriend. I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than watch this over hyped film again.",negative
"One Cut Of The Dead is a 2017 Horror Comedy film directed by Shin'ichirô Ueda and starring Takayuki Hamatsu, Yuzuki Akiyama and Kazuaki Nagaya. Honestly this film blew me away, it might be my second favourite first watch ever
(only behind Vertigo) and it is one of the most original and entertaining films of the last decade, it might even be the best horror film of the 2010's, OK that might be exagerating a bit but it's definitely up there. I don't want to spoil this fantastic film so I'll just recommend everyone to watch as soon as possible without reading any spoilers, it will probably blow you away too.
9.3/10",positive
"Even going in knowing what the central narrative lurch would be doesn't prepare you for how brilliantly this film deconstructs itself. Despite the brisk runtime a lot of the flabby midsection doesn't feel particularly justified and the end credits destroy the illusion somewhat, but the spectacular confection of the final act and the glorious climax is legitimately brilliant. A fun and really fascinating experiment, but only really partially functional as a feature film.",positive
"One Cut of the Dead is a fantastic movie and honestly, I can say I've never seen anything like it. It begins slow, but even then, it grows on you as a fun and endearingly low budget zombie flick. You begin to appreciate the technical difficulty of the thing.When the big reveal comes, the movie just knocks it out of the part and becomes incredibly charming and hilarious. I think a big part of this are the performances, as every actor has to play effectively three roles. It's amazing how they managed to capture the blocking and direction you'd see in a student film, all whilst actually being great actors. Really impressive.I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone, especially if you're trying to get them to appreciate Japanese cinema. It's a movie about making movies and is definitely one that could only be made in Japan.",positive
"I can't decide if this is bonkers or brilliant. It's certainly different, silly, a surprising amount of fun and definitely worth 90 minutes of your time. All I'll say is don't be too quick to judge, all is not as it seems.",positive
"After apretty long and confusing beginning we are transported into another film within a fil a la Le Mepris, day For Night or Living in Oblivion. This one is rather light hearted. The low budget is apparent but also shows what you can do with determination. 7 stars for a great effort.",positive

Waste of time.",negative
"Controversial Japanese director Shin'ichirô Ueda has surprised and delighted critics with this clever take on the popular and well established zombie horror/documentary/satirical black comedy genre.This is a movie that requires patience. It starts slow, and accelerates at a casual pace. The first act runs for about 20 minutes, and at the end of it you might be reaching for the remote already.Don't.The second act unfolds just as slowly as the first, but as more details are revealed you'll realise just how clever this movie really is. The third act kicks off with gusto, and it's a wild ride to the end.Ueda produced his micro-masterpiece on a budget of just $25,000, using unknown actors. It has since delivered returns of more than 1,000% at the box office.I rate One Cut of the Dead at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a razor sharp 8/10 on IMDB.",positive
"This movie is brilliant in its own way. Please take the advice from many other reviewers - be patient and finish the first half, which was a mediocre horror movie that you have seen plenty. Yes I almost walked away multiple times. HOWEVER the second half makes it totally worth it, hilarious and smart. Believe or not, you may want to watch a second time just to catch all the fun.",positive
"I watch a few horrors movies at night every week, and I enjoy all types of horror but this movie, I don't even know where to start.The worst acting I've ever seen and I usually don't use the word cringe, but that how this movie can be best described. The ""intro"" was difficult to watch and I couldn't even understand how a scene that took 20 minutes felt like hours due to the bad acting and even worse ""effects"", if one can even call them that.As a non-native english speaker I watch all movies with subtitles, so the foreign language didn't bother me, but everything else did.
I've read the reviews before I watched the movie and was excited, but whatever the people rating this movie above 3 been smoking, please guys, I need some of that.",negative
I wish it never ends after the end credit rolls. Much fun in this film and I wish it could be better than this but I know it's kind of hard to be better.Although it's the masterful directing but I expected more fun and more variety of storytelling. Some parts are super cringe but anyway they had done a perfect job.,positive
"It's hard to talk about this film without spoiling it, so I'm not going to try. With so many zombie films being released each year, it's hard to find a modern one that has an original voice, but this film aces that. For the first 35 minutes, the film feels really trashy. The acting is bad, the direction feels awkward, and several scenes seem out of place and confusing. While watching the first act though, I didn't dislike that portion of the film. Rather, I found it funny and had a good time with it. After the film appears to end though (in spite of an hour of the film remaining), it's revealed that the ""movie production gone wrong"" element of the first act was actually just a film crew shooting a film. The remainder of the film shows us the behind the scenes footage of the film crew preparing for and shooting the film. While the middle act dragged for me somewhat (this is the only part of the film I had an issue with), the final half hour brings everything home. There, we see the filming of One Cut of the Dead from the perspectives of both the actors and the crew members. It's in this portion of the film where we learn of all the mishaps which occurred during production which the crew had to work around. For example, two cast members got in a car crash on the day of filming and had to be replaced at the last minute, one actor was drunk and another actor had diarrhea during filming, the main cameraman suffered a back injury in the middle of the film and had to be replaced, one actress went off-script and began actually attacking several people, and a camera crane they planned to use for the final shot broke, requiring for the crew to form a human pyramid to improvise. While One Cut of the Dead initially seemed like a trashy horror film, the final act showed why it was as trashy as it was. So many things went wrong while shooting the film and the film crew only managed to finish it by the skin of their teeth. Given all these mishaps, the movie production gone wrong element of the first act was technically real. Just for a different reason than what I had initially suspected. Overall, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. In spite of my issue with the middle act, I found the rest of it really clever and I'm glad I watched it.",positive
"Why does everyone think this is really funny and great. This is a really stupid movie that makes no sense whatever. I get the 3 acts, but who cares.",negative
"I have been watching a lot of zombie films recently and seen them being involved in many different genres like comedy, drama, sci-fi or just plain horror. As I was thinking what different kind might surprise me, I came accross this one. It is about an amateur group of filmmakers shooting a film about zombies.It has a crazy 37 minutes long one-take scene at the beginning. It is very amateur with a lot of errors and plot holes that drive the viewer crazy. The rest of the film is about making of this film. At the beginning, the intention is to make a proper film with a very professional group that will be broadcast live, but the thing is, neverending misfortunes put them through the wringer and something completely different emerges with lots of funny moments. It is the ingenuity of script that made this film so popular.",positive
"I really have not enough good words to say about this movie. I was not very impressed by the start, was actually bored in the middle and by the end I was almost crying in joy. How can a movie be this inconsistent and end up being one my favorite movies in a long time? By truly being a love letter to moviemaking and having its heart in the right place, that's how.",positive
I can't understand how anyone could like this. The first 37 minutes are a disgrace in 1 single shot of something like mobile amateur cinema. The next hour is how they did this. They should pay to see it,negative
"This is the most fun I've had watching a movie for the past year. The timing is impeccable, the script is wonderful, the practical effects are perfect and the camerawork is brilliant. Dont spoil yourself. Just watch it!",positive
"I made it through twelve minutes of this and it was arduous to even get that far. The acting and dialogue and terrible. There's not much else to say, aside from the ratings clearly being padded here because this isn't even a mediocre film, let alone 7.7 out of 10.",negative
"I am a watcher being cheated to see the movie, given its high rating. I fast forward in the first half, complaining that it is like an experimental assignment by student. After half an hour I realise that it is richer than a mere experimental film. The director is to let us see his virtual making of the film.Still I cannot give a good rating because given a second chance, I would choose not to see. Though I would not say it is a waste of time.The female lead has a wood face that I do not like. The other actors are OK. Think before you actually watch it. You must be a very receptive person in order to appreciate the film.",positive
"Just make an account in Imdb to congratulate this movie... Definitely two thumbs up for me..The movie proof that everything that is bad in life is because of your point of view.. try looking at a different perspective... first 30 minutes is painful to see (bad acting, camera angle, lighting, almost everything is bad up to the point I don't wanna see it anymore).. then the next 30 minutes suddenly become better... the last 30 minutes is one of the best for me, totally.. it shows you to appreciate more of everything life has to offer... you can be the negative or positive, your choice..",positive
"I just seen movie at ToHorror Festival, also with subtitle is an incredible movie, for everyone like horror, like to see backstage of movie, or work in this mad world.
It's very difficult to talk about this movie without doing spoiler, but i try to do it.
Acting : terrible enough to be enjoyable, and right to very realist
Shooting : double Dop for a double feature, both work fine to obtain the right result, a funny horror result.
Direction is very complex and i think Directors did a great work.
If like horror you must see it, without reading more about plot, to avoid to waste the suspence. Great Movie",positive
"Absolutely bonkers Japanese horror/comedy mockumentary about a film crew making a zombie movie... which in turn is about a film crew making a zombie movie in which the cast and crew are attacked by real zombies! Some scenes are a bit confusing as to whether they're meant to be 'real' or part of the 'film within the film'; but the whole thing is really entertaining, and at times side-splittingly funny - including an actor who has a secret drink problem, and an actress with a history of descending so far into her roles she's been known to cause serious bodily harm to other actors! Seriously recommended. 8/10.",positive
"It's hard to quantify this film as a whole because it starts so much as one thing and finishes as something else entirely. Shaun of the Dead comparisons are accurate in how whip smart the script is- everything you see on screen is a pay off to something you've seen before (and sometimes after)- but those comparisons pretty much stop there, as this is not your typical zom-com. I think it's best for first-time watchers to approach this movie with as little background as possible because it's certainly a unique and worthwhile viewing experience. In the end, this is a great movie, peppered with humor and a surprising amount of heart stemming from strong themes of family and determination.",positive
"I kept waiting for it get exciting, horrific, funny, or in the least bit entertaining. That never happened for me.My review is too short.... I did appreciate the concept but that doesn't matter too much to me if the film doesn't entertain....

Paraphrasing; ""Don't worry if the first twenty minutes seem slow, after that it gets so much better"" It does not.",negative

And to see it all come together in the end was fantastic!!!",positive
"It's definitely one of the most unique movies I've seen.I've heard that the movie is good. but I did not keep my expectations high. I was expecting a cliche movie with references. I was never so happy that I was wrong. the movie is really good.The film that should be watched as a lesson for students who are studying cinema. Despite the million-dollar projects of the time and the films with world-famous actors, it is a production that shows how to get a quality job with a modest budget of 25 thousand dollars. Moreover, the film has such an impact that it makes a gross revenue of $ 28 million in Japan. first of all, it puts our eyes on how important a good idea is.",positive
"This was probably my best movie watching experience ever. When the ending credits starting rolling at the 35th minute I was like what will happen now. I didn't know I was about to watch one of the best scenario flips ever.
Although I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, I noticed that some people didn't. so I highly recommend you sit through the whole thing.",positive
"Making a decent movie on a minuscule budget is always a tough job.The easiest approach is the found footage approach, but we're all bored with that already. This film manages to find a way to do it on a ridiculously low budget, while parodying the found footage films at the same time. It's clear from some of the user reviews that not everyone watched the film all the way through, while a few were disappointed that it didn't turn out to be the batch of cliches that they were expecting. One person even said ""I think it has a lot of potential if someone makes into (sic) a genuinely scary zombie movie with good acting."" Talk about missing the point! This is a horror comedy, and if you don't like horror comedy, you aren't going to like this one. But, speaking as someone who has probably seen more horror movies than nearly anyone on the planet, this was a refreshing alternative to business as usual. The did more with their tiny budget than I've ever seen done. Not to mention some spectacular casting choices. Worth a look. Especially if you are interested in seeing how much a clever filmmaker can do with very little money.",positive
"I love oriental cinema and so I just bought this Blu-ray based purely on its reputation of being something special. As I'm a big b-movie fan and I collect low budget movies I just had to add this one to my collection.I don't want to go into any spoilers, but if you think this is going to be your ordinary typical b movie zombie fest, we'll think again.This one is truly unique and I was not expecting this at all. The first one take 37 minutes story is absolutely fun, engaging and utterly fascinating, particularly in the way it presents the more gory scenes, like an extreme live action of a looney toon cartoon.Then... well...then you need to keep watching after the end credits, because the story gets really ...unexpected. The pace stalls a bit because we are not exactly sure of what we are watching, but the last 30 minutes totally make up for any slight flaws.This movie has a great ending and it's one of the most positive movies you will see. It will make you want to move to Japan and join the crew that made it. The last thing I was expecting was to get such a happy vibe on a zombie movie but this is an incredible feel good movie.I totally recommend you get the new uk Blu-ray edition, which includes not only a ton of amazing extras and really good making of documentaries for real, but also includes the one take 30 minute zombie movie seen being shot entirely from behind the camera. And there's also a great interview with director among a lot more stuff that will make you wonder that to make a truly original movie you don't need to spend more than $25k.And to top everything , the uk Blu-ray called The Hollywood edition also includes Cut of the dead in Hollywood, which is the movie sequel and it's as fun an cool as the first movie.So go check it out, but don't expect this to be an Hollywood type movie. Don't expect anything else but one of the most unique and original movies you will be watching in a very long time.If you love b movies don't even hesitate.Fun, charming and fascinating.",positive
"This movie confused me, bamboozled me, made me interested and left me satisfied. I just didn't know what to expect and even when I did, I still didn't. It may seem a bit frustrating at first but once it gets to the climax and everything falls into place, the watching experience simply becomes amazing. The ending is just so fulfilling.At first, like many, I wasn't too interested and the only thing that kept me watching was the impressive acting and good camera work, all captured in one take, but it didn't take too long for the plot to capture my curiosity too. I found some of the bad acting hilarious in the first act of the movie but the 3rd act changed my whole perspective. The depth of this movie is impressive, all the long shots and improvisations to explain the 1st act are satisfying and the comedy is bizarre but joyful and enjoyable. I just can't give it enough praise, I love what this movie did with the action sequences.",positive
"Totally unexpected, unpredictable and highly original! Still smiling!",positive
"Yes, it did take a couple of years before I found this gem. This movie is something genuinely different, and brilliantly done. A modern take of François Truffaut's : La Nuit Americaine -- with Zombies! An instant classic, yet a movie that does not take itself too seriously.There is a risk that in the first 30 minutes, you may decide not to see the rest of the movie. Just trust me -- The rewards for watching the 30 minutes will come later.",positive
One of the best movie for movie lover and all horror movie lover..,positive
"One cut of the dead or as it is known in its original language: ""don't stop the camera"" was one of the biggest surprise hits in Japanese cinematic history. Originally released in 2017, shot on a miniscule budget, it was still playing local cinemas whilst I was living in Osaka all throughout 2018 and 2019. Eventually it got picked up for worldwide distribution and conquered the international market too with its unique blend of humour, creativity and warmth.The synopsis fortunately gives only a tiny glimpse into the twists and turns this movie has to offer: An indie movie team is shooting a cheap zombie flick in an abandoned factory when real zombies start to show up all of a sudden. That is not the twist mind you, just the setup for the first act which is good fun in and of itself but only a small portion of what makes the whole thing so endearing. The first half hour is done all in one shot, making creative use of its limited budget yet there is something distinctly strange about how this scenario plays out, which won't be revealed until much later in the film.I won't give anything away beyond the synopsis, but you can look forward to One cut of the dead completely shifting gears and genres at the beginning of each act. Eventually everything comes together in the end in a way that is smart, hilarious, incredibly satisfying and genuinely heart-warming. I think it's a shame this is mostly being advertised as a zombie comedy a la Shaun of the Dead which it most definitely is not, so do yourself a favor and give it a shot, even if you think the beginning looks a bit cheap and bad. It's not a flaw it's the joke. Stick with it and you will be rewarded with one of the best movies I've seen in years.Director Shinichiro Ueda is one to watch. His recent film Special Actors also shared this unique blend of characteristics.",positive
"I love this movie. Wow started out fun and funny (Action) and took a turn for even better, the credit scene was even more awesome. it's like making a documentary of a zombie movie within a movie. It was well done",positive
This is my new favorite movie of the year. Go watch it just trust me. It's so surprising,positive
"I watched this movie with my boyfriend. He has watched it before and said it was so good. I watched the first 30 minutes and I was like ""what? are you kidding me?"" I almost stopped watching it. But as the movie proceeded, oh my god it was so good. The plot is so original, funny and moving at the same time. A masterpiece.",positive
"I loved this one. This movie is not like any other movie I've seen. The script is very good and it is extremely well thought through. The movie gets you many times and leaves you confused. Don't worry when you are confused, you will catch on a little later.This movie is extremely funny piece of art and a must see for any movie lover.",positive
I love zombie movies and this was pretty good. It's got a real B-movie feel to it if you like that stuff. It's pretty short at just over 35 minutes but it does have that low budget feel.I think I watched the DVD version because the after-credits blooper reel and behind the scenes footage take forever and you may want to skip that part.,positive
"Yesterday if you told me I was going to recommend a Japanese zombie movie I wouldn't have believed you, and yet One Cut of the Dead may be the best foreign language zombie movie since Romero's Night of the Living Dead.The reason it's so successful is because it's less zombie movie than it is love letter to film making in general. Saying anything more would be giving things away, so suffice it to say: The movie is excellent for B-horror movie fans, zombie-movie fans, or aspiring film makers. It is the most meta-movie you'll ever watch and like nothing you've seen before. Despite the language barrier the characters are excellent, rounded, and have enough backstory you feel where they're coming from. This is amazing in a movie that's barely 90 minutes, but it's all quality.",positive
Its neither fun or scary.. everything about this film sucks.. dont watch it.,negative
I thought it would be a good movie based on its rank 7.9 but with watching its first 30 minutes the movie is very basic and watching it is wasting time,negative
"One Cut of the Dead was the most lauded film of Frightfest 2018. Everyone was raving about it almost as though a virus has been passed from person to person that meant they were deeply in love with the film. For about thirty minutes I was completely stumped to why people regarded this in any positive light. The acting was stilled and awkward, the dialogue awful and the makeup effects lame and cheap looking. The one cut technique was brave, but it seemed too much for an inexperienced crew.However, approximately 30 minutes in the movie changes direction completely. The second part of the film is about a new zombie channel hiring a small-time director to shoot a 30 minute, live, one take zombie thriller for their opening day of broadcasting. It becomes apparent that it was a movie within a movie and, for the next hour, time jumps back a month showing the whole filmmaking process including all the behind the scenes disasters that cultivated in the supposed poor quality of the film.The final third of the film is very much like The Disaster Artist and fact you need to see The Room to appreciate The Disaster Artist. You need to get through the film's supposedly poor first 30 minutes to appreciate the comedic brilliance of the film as a whole. Overall, the film is a loveable, inventive and hilarious riot.",positive
"Despite the one take being impressive, the first 50ish minutes dragged at times, but I'm glad I paid attention as it all began to make sense in the second half.I don't like many modern horror films, but One Cut of the Dead isn't the sort of horror that'll keep people awake at night, and it ended up as more of a comedy about indie film making. It'll probably get a big American remake, but Asian filmmakers do this sort of comedy best. The final third of the film has some of the funniest moments I've seen. And if that wasn't enough, the ending is wonderfully heartwarming and something that propelled One Cut of the Dead from a good film into one of my favourites.Each character had their own quirks and the whole cast were excellent. You may not think this in the first half if you're watching for the first time, but as I said, it all begins to make sense.For its creativeness and heartwarming ending, One Cut of the Dead just about beats ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"" as my favourite zombie-comedy film. It's also the first time I've rewatched big chunks of a film immediately after it ended. With very few exceptions, I rarely rewatch films.Fans of One Cut of the Dead may also enjoy ""One Cut of the Dead Mission: Remote"" - a feelgood short film made remotely with the same cast reprising their roles, all while under COVID-19 lockdown. The filmmakers have made it available for free (including English subtitles) on YouTube.",positive
"If you ever think that filming is easy, then you definitely MUST WATCH THIS FILM. You'll learn that it took a lot of efforts and timing to shoot this film especially a one take film is not easy at all. Sometimes you will also face unexpected problem and have to solve it quickly. Bravo to the cameraman who is holding the camera for so long. Impressive acting and the idea is so fresh. By the way, this movie is not your typical kind of horror zombie film.Reasons to watch
-Funny
-Impressive Acting
-Learn how film production worksReasons Not to Watch
-you're not interested in behind the scene
-you're looking for horror zombie kinda film",positive
"A zombie movie wrapped in a reality tv show encased in a study of filmmaking itself! This is worth the watch for any lover of horror films. If you want big Hollywood movie love, move on.",positive
"I am not going to tell you anything about the story of the movie here, which is absolutely genius by the way. I am just going to say that this movie is a laughter riot. Thoroughly enjoyable and I was laughing my ass off during the entire movie.
There just might be a few moments where you feel the movie is going a bit slow but thats just all part of the script.
So grab a beer with your friends and watch this movie late night!!",positive
"The synopsis clued me in that this wasn't going to be a run-of-the-mill zombie movie, but I definitely wasn't expecting it to take the meta genre-mashup route that it did. I won't go into plot details because it's definitely a movie where the less you know going the better, but you should also probably give it your full attention as there's loads of things to pick up on. I fell for all of the twists and I think the way they're gradually pulled off does a great job at keeping things interesting, plus the film is constantly adding new context and reference-points to previous events, especially in its final act. The comedy elements are really good, providing both laugh-out-loud moments and more visual humour, but there's also some feel-good comedy moments. All the acting's really good and the cast do a good job at staying in character(s) during longer takes. How the film unfurls makes things a little confusing at first, but if you stick with it it's worth it and there's a surprisingly nice, even heart-warming, ending. If you liked the ""Charlie Work"" episode of It's Always Sunny, then you'll probably appreciate this, just be ready for a bunch of curveballs.",positive
"Like many many others have already said, stick with it, the first 35 minutes will all makes sense later on, I was one of those who almost switched it off as it seemed so awful to begin with..but you'll find it why.Can't say too much without giving it away but it's got a good a mix of direction, humour (translates really well!) and wit.Considering this film was only 2.99, it offers fantastic value!",positive
"Some parts of the movie was intentionally made bad, some is because they are worthless filmmakers. I somehow feel that all the friends and relatives of the people involved in this film logged in to IMDB to make a good appearance with reviews and ratings. Otherwise, you can't enjoy or tolerate this thing.",negative
"The less you know about this the better. Some may need to exercise patience during the first 30 minutes, but if you let yourself be drawn in and pay attention to details, you'll be rewarded with some very clever story telling. If you're like me, all those little things that annoyed you in the first part will be some of your favorite bits by the end.",positive
"The first section of the film looks cheap, with a woman screaming annoyingly for over half an hour.Then the first section ends. A second part begins which shows how to make the first part. Why? Who cares how to make a poor film.I just gave up. The high scores are full of bias. There are many zombie films that are better than this rubbish.I'm trying to be as fair and honest as I can when I say this film should be avoided. You will either hate it, or despise it.Update
Watched final half hour.This part of the film is easily the best, and ties together the first 2 parts. But this final part is still just average, maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best.So overall...
Part 1 (bad zombie film) 3/10
Part 2 (making the film) 3/10
Part 3 (merging parts) 6/10
Overall 4/10 = nowhere near the high 9 and 10 out of 10 scores given by most (biased) reviews.",negative
"Who knew a zombie movie would leave me feeling so warm and fuzzy inside!I enjoyed this so much.
Luckily, on my first viewing, I already knew to stick with it if everything seemed a bit rubbish.
Indeed the first section IS terrible but if you stay around you'll find out why.It's a real gem.Easily my new favourite ""Zombie"" movie.",positive
"One Cut of the Dead is an interesting and well crafted indie horror. While the fans of the genre may find it a bit to cheesy for its own good, this is exactly what it's trying to be. It surprises us many times and manages to totally confuse us with the direction it's going to. Lighthearted and humorous it's an example of a movie for people that are in love with movies. There are multiple movie layers inside of it and at the beginning its almost impossible to figure them out but eventually it all merges into an awesome indie horror about making an indie horror.",positive
"From my perspective, awesome! I was so excited for this movie that I signed up to shudder as it was the only place I could find it. I read a number of reviews before watching this movie and they pretty much all said the same thing...Watch the movie with no expectations. I have to say that this is a fact.Unfortunately, I didn't listen to the advice. I was very disappointed in the movie at the beginning. It really wasn't what I had on my radar. I had so many ideas of what this could be about, I wasn't even close.In the end, once you get used to the idea, you will have a good time. I laughed out loud a number of times and truly touched by the end of the movie. The best advice I can give to you is pick this movie if you are looking for a little bit of everything.",positive
"I can recommend this film with the bottom of my heart.
You will laugh untill your stomach hearts.
Have Fun and a nice Film hour !!!!",positive
"Look know further a zombie film, one take with twists and turns to never stop you guessing! A brilliant film don't hesitate just go and watch it. It is now in my top 3 zombie films if not the my top!",positive
"I agree with the bad reviews, rating was an absolute joke! It wasn't funny nor scary at all! Save yourselves from 1.5 hrs of utter boredom! 😆",negative
"One Cut of the Dead, Kamera wo tomeru na!, is a gory blood fest and at the same time a funny and sweet family comedy.It's a fantastic movie that explores in a funny and stylized way the art of making films and if you love movies you will certainly love this. Plays with the horror genre like its play-doh and has a comedic-timing that most of the big budget hollywood productions should be jealous of.Did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. One of my favorite zombie comedies alongside Shaun of the Dead.",positive
"Great script, really fun and unique, A movie about a movie filming a movie. Watch it, you'll be happy you did.",positive
"I love movies. I love foreign movies. Asian horror movies I have watched have been some of the best ever, but honestly I have NEVER SEEN A WORSE MOVIE THAN THIS. It's great that they made it for 25k and made 25 mill but jesus christ it's not funny (at all) and not even a horror. I barely write reviews but this movie just angered me. I kept waiting for it to start and now I just want to sue them for taking 1.5 hours of my life that I will never get back. I'm very confused by the good reviews, they must be from all of the crew and their friends. Please dont watch it, I'm not being bad and I really dont mean to be but it's very terrible. I hope I never have to remember it again!! Ugh my eyes! If I could give it minus a million stars I would. Sorry!",negative
Good movie of the year!.The trailer seem like to fool you for what they are really want to represent. Watch its!,positive
"I have been putting off watching this movie for years. I've heard only rave reviews for it but I have to be in the right mood to sit down and watching a subtitles movie. I have to admit, at about 25 minutes in I paused this movie, saw there was more than an hour left, and wondered what garbage movie am I watching and is it the same movie that everyone else is raving about? I had no idea how they were going to drag another entire hour out of the movie. I was very close to turning the movie off and moving on to something else but I stuck with it and I am glad I did.No spoilers, but still with those early bad special effects, bad characters, bad acting, and bad everything else just watch it and be amazed how everything turns out.",positive
"New, fresh, innovative. So, not a hype thing. So, YES.",positive
"And if you love cinema, you gonna love it too !Dont do like many people who give up the movie after 20 minute, the movie deserve your attention and trust me, your patience will be well rewarded.",positive
Very clever movie. Thought at first this was just a boring zombie movie but i was wrong as son as the it reaches 30 mins of the movie . The last 30 minute was epic fun.,positive
"It's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it, so I won't event try. The first forty minutes or so of the film is a one-take zombie movie where a deranged director attempts to add verisimilitude to his cheesy movie by causing a zombie apocalypse. It seems a little cheesy at first as it quickly becomes clear that what seems like the typical flaws of an independent movie are very much intentional.After that, the film changes gear as we see that the events we have been watching are a film within a film. In fact, we find that the zombie movie is a tv film being made as a live broadcast for a new television station. The antagonist becomes the protagonist, a director who is hired for his speed and willingness to work for cheap rather than his artistic ability. His abilities are soon put to the test as everything that can go wrong during the shooting does, meaning that the director has to resort to drastic improvisation to save his project.Not only is this movie funny but it is a touching look at the low-budget filmmaking process. The movie is really a film about the people behind the scenes of a film and how they work together to make a movie work. If there's any message to take from ""One Cut of the Dead"", it's really how artistry can be found in even the slightest of films.",positive
"The most original film I've seen in a long time. Really refreshing and hugely enjoyable. Top tip: stick with it for the first 40mins, the payoff is absolutely worthwhile.",positive
If you have the slightest interest in Japan or Zombie movies do not miss this one! It's like the Noises Off of zombie flicks . . . except actually good :),positive
"Loud, crazy, confusing and ultimately a movie that will make you smile. A film about a film about a film about a zombie film that gets attacked by real zombies. Or is it? Smart and funny.",positive
"Upon watching the first part of this movie, I thought it was just another badly done zombie movie with poor lighting and camera work. But instead of just a movie within a movie we get a movie within a movie within a movie. The idea's not bad but the execution just doesn't work due to the lack of suspense and drama. Despite it being described as a comedy, there are no vestiges to be found; unless one is easily amused at purposefully dodgy acting. One Cut Of The Dead is definitely not that great but it's not terrible either. Just about watchable but not re-watchable.",negative
"It starts off grainy, poorly acted and.... odd. Like things don't make sense. After the 36 minute mark, it all starts to come together. And the third act, complete organized chaos! One of the most clever films I've seen. Highly recommend for the third act alone!",positive
The best zombie comedy-drama since I don't know what,positive
"No spoiler, so I just write ""Watch it"", at least if you like hilarious funny movies. In the first 2/3 of the movie you might get a desire to stop watching (it's kind of boring), but the last part is hilarious and you can't skip the beginning because it won't be funny if you just watch the last part.",positive
"It hard to rate such a movie. I have seen a lot, a lot of good movies, and a lot of bad movies. I have seen tens of zombies movies, and tens of Asian movies. This one, by far, is the worse movie I have ever seen. The worse Zombie movie and the worse Asian movie. Worse acting ever, worst scenario, worse make-up. Everything is rubbish about this movie.",negative
"Negative reviews will warn you about the first 30ish minutes. Yes, It is a TERRIBLE Zombie joint, plain and simple. However, that is where they dupe you. Not all is as it appears. Give it a chance, let the credits roll by. That's literally all I can say without completely ruining this low budget gem.",positive
"The movie seemed boring at first. I didn't get why this movie got such a good rating at first. Then as I watched the movie, I got the clue. There ought to be a second camera filming them.The movie gets better as the minute passes by. By the third act, you will be laughing at the movie. Its genuinely funny and humorous. You will understand why the Act 1 was awful and confusing.Believe my words and bear with the movie for some minutes. You will love this movie.",positive
"Not bad..not so good,,, i don't know what to say...... but make humor",positive
"Had a blast watching this quirky and highly entertaining movie.
I don't want to spoil it for you, just watch it and you won't regret it. I laughed non stop once it was clear what they were doing.
Go and see it.",positive
One Cut of the dead is japans best slasher zombie low budget film to come out that year (2017). Absolute cult classic in the making and will be remembered for decades. If your into low budget slasher films look no further.,positive
Go and watch the movie before reading the reviews. Don' take the film seriously. First 30 minutes you will get surprised why this movie had such good rating. I don't want spoil anything. Because it has its unique moments. Surprisingly funniest movie of that year. A feel good movie in horror genre.,positive
"It's utter crp, what a waste of time, it's good for nothing, it's one of worst movies ever.. not at all funny not even a bit.. Are these ratings & reviews are definitely paid crp or tasteless sh£t opinions.",negative
"This movie will give us an understanding about what cinema can do. And also give proof how fun making movie is.
Well written scripts with a perfect directing and hilarious-outstanding preformances from the actors.
Love this movie so much",positive
After watching 35 minutes you will think its a boring movie and after that you will say just Awesome!!!,positive
"Just watch and everything will make sense.Mind. Blown.Stopped after 10 minutes, read a gushing review, persisted. Stopped after 20, read another gushing review. Persisted.So so so pleased I did. Awesome.Am watching it again tomorrow with my wife.Oscars watch out again I'd say.",positive
Low-budget Japanese film featuring a zombie apocalypse. Something new on Zombie movie.,positive
Better to watch with an empty mind. Just keep enduring the shaking camera for 30 mins then you will find out why the first head-aching 30 mins make the next 60 mins worth the wait. One of the best sophisticated movie I've ever seen. Minus 1 point for really bad dizziness handy-cam.,positive
"One of the best comedy/horror movies.
Behind-the-scenes experiences are delivered successfully, and the story development is executed properly.",positive
Horrible beginning --- boring center ---- but amazing and fun ending. A film that has to be seen to the end.,positive
"Really brilliant movie. I first thought this is gonna be an another Japanese movie with weird type of humor. The movie's comedy is like chaotic comedy. Everything goes out wrong and the main character has to keep it going. At first, I got bored and didn't want to continue watching after first 30 minutes, after the first half the magic starts and as they continue the second half you can really enjoy, laugh and understand at the boring weird scenes from the first half. The acting were great too. For a comedy movie like this, the acting is not necessarily significant to notice and the cast did a great job. The story is what makes this movie brilliant. After the movie, you will really understand and appreciate how making of this movie is brilliant and the crew's effort on how they make.",positive
"It is Different from the other zombies film, i like every zombies film..but this film totally special.. a lot of comedy ..n art from 37 minutes no cut!!",positive
"I am sure when writing and making the movie, the writer, director and actors couldn't have seen the masterpiece they were crafting and yet they did.In my book, this movie is THE most innovative movie in the last 40 years.The overall execution is flawless.The acting from everyone is Oscar worthy.The background score complements fully.The pacing is tight.But it is the concept which makes it one of the greatest movies ever made. It's simple yet hyper original.Spoiling anything about the movie is a crime that I am not willing to commit. I don't want to rob you of the pleasure you deserve to experience.Go in blind. Do not watch the trailer. Do not read the synopsis.Just sit back an be ready to be blown away.",positive
"I heard this movie was very good from my friends. Finally I had a chance to watched it. Then I understand why eveybody talk how good it is. They show you can make a good entertaing movie with very low-budget. Good script, characters and concept. I really enjoyed it.Start very B-grade acting and scene, making very cheap zombie movie, not expecting anything special effects, but you find out inside story of making it.Surprisingly funny and heart- warming as zombie movie making !! I recommend to anyone even if you don't like zombie characters. This is not a horror movie at all. It's fun to watch from the start to the end!",positive
"A unique 90 minute film that has an incredibly dry set-up for a clever finale. To clarify, this is intended to be a comedy, not a zombie film. Have extra time on your hands & watch a unique, goofy comedy with some filler material? Go for it. Have friends/family over or looking for a premier film to watch this weekend? Not recommended, this film is not for everyone.The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly difficult to watch. Many viewers will be tempted to walk away. If you're able to tough it out, this dry 60 minute stretch all allow for the set-up of a clever, 30 minute final act. While I enjoyed the final act, I do not believe it justified an hour of mind-numbing material.At a minimum, the film could have been better edited to cut out some irrelevant material to the plotline.",negative
"I have no idea why I put this movie into my watchlist in first place. Tonight I got bored and decided to give it a chance. It does look like a cheesy student project. If it wasn't for how pathetically laughable it was, probably I would had quit after 15 minutes. Without any spoilers, there is more than meets the eye, and by the end, my jaw dropped. This is pure creativity!",positive
"90 minutes of the most fun I'd had in the cinema in years, loads of laughs, plenty of twists and in the end a great story. Guaranteed you won't leave until the credits have ended.Not sure I would describe it as a zombie movie though.",positive
"Brilliant and ingenious. Just wanted to add that in the kabuki, the kuroko are stage hands you are not meant to see... they wear black and manipulate costumes and props. Without spoiling anything it seems to be a tribute to this Japanese sense of invisibility! It's very well made and thought through.",positive
"Normally I avoid even the slightest hint of a spoiler, including previews, but sometimes it pays to hear minor ideas about a movie. In the case of this movie, I may not have made it to the point it really starts to shine had I not known it was a different sort of movie. I am having trouble coming up with something to liken this to. It starts out as terrible as just about any high school student film you'll see. Within a few minutes there is enough to keep you wondering though, because there are some really awkward and strange moments, with odd shots that go beyond rookie film-making. Once the movie gets past its initial reveal and you quickly get over ever thinking you may have wasted your time. The rest of the film is really just a comedy and I was laughing along more often than I've laughed at a movie for a while. It was really an enjoyable ride and about as uplifting a film you'll find under the horror genre. The credits even have a final layer peeled back and show you the actual single-shot camera man doing the work they mimicked doing throughout the movie. There were a few moments that I wondered whether they were even planned, two which involved people falling on set, one of which was then copied in the sham meta-view. I was kind of expecting a third layer since it was considered horror where I watched it, but it didn't need it and just ends up being a fun ride.",positive
"Despite the low budget, the movie is excellent and very funny!",positive
"What's about this stock-like The Sims music?! Oh my God, it ruined the whole fantastic music. Why, why, why...?",positive
So glad they did! What a great movie. A low-budget horror flick about a low-budget horror flick... Well done!,positive

"It's a sweet masterpiece of originality. Do not pay attention to the low reviews, they did not go forward with the movie after the first part, that in purpose it was made to be seen a a trashy zombies one, but if you continue with the second part you will find the reasons of all of that.Bravo for this film, I loved it!",positive
"It was in the premiere of the Sitges - Catalonian International Film Festival, like 10 minutes, stand up clapping at the end of the movie, is a experience of loving and laughing the cinema, no remakes necessary.",positive
